__label__2	An essential book for movie lovers everywhere: As far as I'm concerned the most important holiday every year is Academy Awards night, with the second most important being the day the nominations are announced. Obviously, the Academy Awards are my life and Inside Oscar is my Bible. No matter what page you open this book, you'll be totally drawn and completely forget about time. If I had one complaint it's that too much time is spent on recent years while earlier decades are given less attention. Still, it's such a wonderfully written book, so catty and bitchy, but all in fun; I can't wait for the next edition and find out all the shenanigans involving Titanic and how it's possible Helen Hunt beat Kate Winslet....
__label__1	Two thumbs down - way down!: This book was in one word - boring. It talks about the first academy awards...blah, blah, blah...and then the latest. The book is filled with usless babble that isn't even worth knowing! Listen people - DO NOT waste your money buying this book and/or your time reading this book! What a wasteful piece of crap...
__label__2	Oscar Euphoria!: This book is amazing. Its year-by-year descriptions are historical and often suspensful. I remember the first time I read this book, before I knew the outcome of many of the years' awards; each year was a new drama with Mr. Wiley and company setting up the atmosphere of the race. Now, fifteen years later, I own the latest edition of Inside Oscar. It is a constant source of amusement and information. The writing is skillful and clever, and the categorical listing at the back is an invaluable reference. Every year during Oscar season, I will pick up an article by some journalist whose grasp of Oscar history is minimal, and I wonder why they don't just look up who REALLY won in Inside Oscar. I know Mr. Wiley is no longer with us, but I hope Mr. Bona and company continue the great work for future editions. I know I'd love to be a contributor to this tremendous work.
__label__2	"The winner is....""Inside Oscar"": If you enjoy the hype of the Academy Awards, this is the book for you. Plenty of behind-the-scenes action that you're not going to find by simply watching the Academy Awards. It's gossipy, dishy, and dirty...a definite guilty pleasure. Great index of past Academy Award winners and nominees as well."
__label__1	This is a Bootleg,Don't buy.: I would like to recommend to anyone who have thought of buying this box set, to stay away. I've been a die-hard Metallica fan since the 80's, and i have never bought a bootleg album w/out hearing something off of it. I'm also in the Official Metallica Club, we are notified weeks before anyone else that a new album is coming out. They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one. I of course don't plan on getting it though. Who in their right mind would pay almost $140 for an item not even licensed by the band. I hope everyone who was thinking about buying this reads this first, so you all don't get ripped off.
__label__1	This is NOT a bootleg: This is simply not a bootleg. It was an overseas limited box set release. The band (or label) has done similar box sets. They did one for the Hero Of The Day single, limiting it to 1,000 copies. They also have plans to release a limited vinyl box soon. This is simply a collectable, nothing more than that. There are no music extras in this box.As a limited box it doesn't really offer very much at all. The CD you can purchase anywhere and the packaging of the actual disc(s) is no different than the standard (Vertigo) version. Do we really need a hat and a flag?For die hard collectors only.
__label__2	"The book that tought me color.: Itten's analysis and application of color is thoughtful and scientific. As a practicing art director, I have successfully used the theories and methods explained in ""Elements of Color"" for over twenty years. I also teach them to my design classes. Whether you use a paintbrush or a mouse, his ""seven color contrasts"" will prove invaluable."
__label__1	Kindle edition has Black and white images?!: I've seen printed versions of this book and I've been thinking about getting it for a while. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the kindle version would be in black and white. When discussong color and showing diagrams showing the actual colors really helps. I am soo soo disappointed with this purchase. The books content itself is amazing but I'm going to rethink ordering ebooks from amazon in the future.
__label__1	"Way over my head!: This book was recommended by an instructor. I am new to this crazy pursuit of oil painting. My instructor called this her ""bible"" of color theory, but I honestly didn't understand much of it. Way too detailed, written in language that may be appropriate for someone who has a degree in fine art or art education, but certainly not for a beginner."
__label__1	Itten, the elements of color: The information in this book is interesting, but the color in the color wheels and all color samples are very pale and washed off. Very disappointing.If you need to use the color wheels or scales as references, this book will not be helpful.
__label__1	"Technical book written by someone who does not know how to write a technical book.: It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."
__label__2	Reasonable price, helpful, succinct: Much less expensive than Albers' book on Color and quite as good. Arrived promptly, in great condition. Useful for a color theory class.
__label__2	Great Book: This book is really helpful for learning about color theory. Its technical but really interesting so you can get through it easily.
__label__2	Excellent how-to book on training your retriever: After reading this book, I felt like I was an expert on the how-to's of training retrievers. I have tried out many of these training techniques with my dog and have had fabulous success. And I could swear that my dog has spoken a word or two after several training sessions! I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in having a well-disciplined dog. A brilliant piece of work!
__label__2	Psychology class: The book is well written and very interesting. I don't mind reading it unlike other textbooks. Was a little nervous about it not getting it in the mail before my class started, but it did get shipped and delivered right on time.
__label__2	Book that tells a story: I loved the way the author brought in stories of various children. I felt like I got to know the children throughout their stages of development. A great textbook!
__label__1	Book in great condition, but took 20 days to get it: This book was brand new when I received it. However, it did not arrive for 20 days after I ordered it.
__label__2	I am biased, but this is an amazing book. A must have for any modern American art collector!: Well, I am biased, as Warren Brandt was my paternal grandmother's brother. I knew him personally growing up and was lucky to inherit his passion and talent for art. This book is a limited edition, and is beautiful from the beginning, as it is bound in a slipcover and is large in size. As for Brandt's work, it ranges in medium from oil to ink to watercolor, pencil and photography. Each subject is captured in a unique way, and each work tells a story, simply by the subject's pose or by the medium used. If you are a modern American art collector, this book is a treasure.
__label__2	"Nelly Returns to the Waves: St. Louis rapper Nelly hits the airwaves with the first single from his new album ""Nellyville."" The song is very catchy and was one of the summer of 2002's biggest hits. Not many rap artists can produce catchy songs due to the high level of un-originality that market has (e.g., sampling Broadway musicals, Duran Duran songs, etc..) but Nelly has proven that with this song that not only can he get his groove on, but that he can produce a single with high potential for market crossover success. Regardless of his feud with other old-school rap artists such as KRS-1, Nelly's appeal lies in his ability to adapt to the times, something that many rappers have not been able to do. Only a handful artists such as Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah, and Ice Cube have mastered the art of keeping with rap's evolution, and so far Nelly has. Overall, ""Hot in Here"" is a great summer anthem sure to keep anyone moving. Regardless of the song's critics it remains one of 2002's best jams."
__label__1	Cheesy, dangerous gadget,: I've had the smaller model only about a month. Nevertheless, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Not recommended.Better brands include Firth, Unicorn's Magnum and Magnum Plus, William Bounds, and Peugeot.
__label__1	Don't buy it !: This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill.
__label__1	Hard to clean: We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean. I have turned it completely inside out, scrubbed between all the cracks, and still food is stuck in the seams andthreads. It is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort.
__label__2	Crocodile Creek Wild Animals Lunchbox: I LOVE Crocodile Creek Lunchboxes! They are perfect for Kindergarten and 1st Grade children since they don't require as much lunch as an older child may. It can even hold a thermos drink cup or soup cup.This lunchbox has held up wonderfully thru an entire year of daily lunches, being thrown around in class, smashed in packpacks and drug across lunch tables. I highly recommend this product to anyone with younger children.
__label__2	Cute Lunchbox: Love the Wild Animals lunchbox. It's more like - zoo animals.It has a good, thick amount of insulation and is free of harmful plastics, etc. It's also a lot roomier than your average lunchbox and I like this because it leaves extra room for more freezer blocks to keep everything very cold. We also send two drinks, one for lunch and one for snacktime and the extra room is great!I agree with others about this being difficult to clean, so we send a paper plate and have the little one eat outside of the lunchbox, so we don't wind up with crumbs, etc inside the interior seams, problem solved.It's also nice to have a lunchbox that not every kid has, so he knows which one is his. This will probably last the entire school year and that's good for a fabric lunchbox. I would buy this again and will get another next year.
__label__2	CAUGHT WITHOUT WORDS!: This album is a breath of fresh air, more melodic tones, great lyrics and a soft spoken ora about it.alot of bans tend tostay away from there true feelings but the lead singer poises to tell everyone how he feels.maybe you can say they felt alot of emotions writing this album it is truly a masterpiece, yeah there first two albums were poorly mixed but this album surely makes up for that.i just love this album its in my top 5 this year.the best songs are:1.bug eyes2.not that simple3.caught without arms4.planting seedsoverall i give this album a 5/5 perfecto masterpiece5/5 for production5/5 for lyrics5/5 for musical pace5/5 for making me a fan
__label__2	Great Effort: Simply one of the better bands around today. Do yourself a favor and pick any of their music. I'm sure you'll find it a pleasant surprise.
__label__2	"Well-crafted music: Please do not categorize this band as they will elude any classification you attempt. That's the essence and beauty of music that's carefully woven and passionately performed.Dredg is an anomale and I pray they stay true to their pursuit and void all ""commercial"" temptations lured by record execs a.k.a. SATAN. Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH I FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE."
__label__2	weird stuff: Dredge is different from anyone I've heard yet. I can't Tell what this guy is singing about. By far Dredge has some of the most modern, but beautiful music out. Young musicians. you can call it emo maybe. evn if you hate emo check this album out. I bought it knowing nothing about it. Bug Eyes is fantastic, even though I have no idea what it means.
__label__2	"Best Album I Have Ever Heard. PERIOD !!!: Buy this album, and go ahead and buy el cielo as well. Both albums are near perfect, yet ""Catch Without Arms"" is closer to perfection. I saw dredg in Dallas, TX on 6/1 and they are amazing live as well. I love this band and in my opinion this cd is worth 10 times more than they charge. I can't say enough good things about this band/album. It has honestly changed my life for the positive. This music moves me in ways I have rarely known in my 26 years. Thank you dredg, you are the savior of all that is great about rock."
__label__2	best album I've heard in a while: On my first listen to 'Catch Without Arms,' I was a little disappointed. I had been hoping for something that was closer in style to Leitmotif, but that's not what they delivered. But after listening to it a few times, I've gotten over the fact that their style has diverged a bit from their original sound. And, now I think that I do like 'Catch Without Arms' even more than their previous efforts.
__label__2	Great CD: I would definitely recommend Catch Without Arms to anyone that is a fan of alternative music. Some of my favorites are: Catch Without Arms, Zebraskin, and Hungover on a Tuesday. You owe it to yourself to pick this one up. 5 stars.
__label__2	An Album I can't get enough of!: When I herd them for thr first time they blew my mind I love them and they lyrics , I just love listing to good music!
__label__1	Evolving??: If the word evolving means that you simplify song structures and lyrics and make it more dull and lame then this band is really good at that. How can you say this band is evolving ? Yes it is album that is more easy to listen to when washing the dishes or just hanging around with friends drinking beer, but even so becomes boring. I have a feeling that Dredg has one of the biggest amount of fanboys ever. What they say is totaly irrelevant. I have NEVER wanted this new album to be like El cielo. And i really doubt that other dissapointed reviewers too wanted another El cielo. It is just soulless guys.
__label__1	Hot lava Indeed: I completely agree... the album seems so unlike such a thoughfull and talented band. Not to say i've lost faith in dredg , just i need some time to get over this travesty.
__label__1	"a terrible descent: When I heard their first album, leitmotif, I was blown away (something that only ocassionally happens). A fascinating album, combining various instrumentals with well placed vocals. so some time went by and eventually I bought the follow up, el ceilo (sp), and to say the least it was really damn disappointing. songs were too structured, ambiant sounds were predictable and not-interesting. and the lyrics SUCKED. i was really bummed. but then I saw a new album comming out. alright, perhaps they learned from mistakes, perhaps every song won't sound over-produced and catchy. instead, it only got worse. if you had never heard this band before, ""catch without arms"" will probably sound alright. but if you knew how good they were on leifmotif, don't buy this. i feel like i wasted my money (and i rarely feel that way about music). dredg has lost whatever it was they had. they are just mediocre. a real tragedy"
__label__1	Just horrible: I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame.
__label__1	until you've walked in my shoes: As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order.
__label__1	"The book is irrelevant; how about the author?: In reading use comments about Yanni's album ""If I Could Tell You"" I noticed this author advertised his book. Regardless of the book's merits, I think it should be rejected due to the author being a shallow, inappropriate capitalist.PS I'm proud of myself for not swearing at Mr. Mcandrew in this post."
__label__1	Terrible Book!: Author doesn't believe in any biological interventions and feels you should just accept you kid's disability and get on with it. Needs to spell check his work also.
__label__2	"Author Shows Vision: Jeff's book ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"" will stand the test of time. Although it has some minor editing problems, the content has character and vision. This parent's insights will be respected for the honesty and love that underlies the effort. I liked Jeff's poetry and pictures of his son at the end of the book. This added a very nice personal touch. I recommend the book to parents of autistic children and to all parents. I was inspired by his honesty."
__label__1	TERRIBLE DONT BOTHER: neither artist are together on this cd u get five tracks of stanley anf the rest gloria all badly re issued on cd ...please dont waste your money as i did
__label__1	TERRIBLY BAD RECORDING: I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did
__label__2	Heart is awesome!!: I absolutely adore Heart and hadn't heard this album in years! I actually purchased it for my mom and it hasn't left her CD player since.
__label__1	"Heart Becomes a Hair Band: To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s ""hair band"" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not."
__label__2	Heart's Capitol debut is a smash hit!: In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983,following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefall,whose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs:WHAT ABOUT LOVE is a hard-rocker featuring Starship's Grace Slick on background vocals. IF LOOKS COULD KILL was a minor hit. NEVER is another hard-rocker. THESE DREAMS is considered adult comtemporary. NOTHING AT ALL sounds cool. All the other songs are very good.
__label__2	heart is stiil beating: heart is still beating after all these years. yes, they did have hits in the '70s with magic man, dreamboat annie,baracuda,straight on,and dog and butterfly. yes, by the early '80s, they didn't have anymore hits,but that's how the music business goes. yes, by 1985,they were ready to strike again. yws,they did have 4 top 10 hits from this great album.those hits were what about love(#10),never(#4),these dreams(#1),and nothin' at all(#10). yes,this album did hit #1 and sell in the millions. does that answer all of your questions? yes,this review is over. thank you and have fun. ed wilson
__label__2	With some help from MTV..............: Heart was back, and bigger than ever. 'Heart' was a last ditch effort to keep the band together. If it failed, Heart would no longer exist. Well history shows what happened.MTV made four videos for this album, and they made Nancy Wilson every teenager's dream girl. Ann was always my favorite sister and she looked real good too. MTV milked this album for all it was worth, and Heart was now an official '80's band', like it or not. This album brought a breath of life into their career that seemed to be standing still.Besides the singles, I always liked 'The Wolf', but 'Shell Shock' was by far the hardest, loudest, most rockin' tune on the whole album.
__label__2	"the best album by a female-lead group: I love this cd! I never get tired of the songs,especially ""Never"". It's got both fast as well as slow rock which can get you on your feet or put you in another world. No matter what, this will always be my favourite album."
__label__2	"LIFE ROCKER: Had this one on vinyl back then. These girls know what rock and roll is! This IS HEART at their best [in the 80's].Not only the 5 singles on this album make it awesome but, the other songs are very good! I can tell by other critics that they must expect perfection consistently. Well man, it's ROCK AND ROLL and it's ""HEART"". Just one of the best in the business! They need NO critics! My opinion is that this album ROCKS! It's one of the girls best. LOVE YA GIRLS!ROCK ON! P.S. CAN'T GO WRONG HERE."
__label__2	LOVE THIS!: This thing is freakin awesome! You can stand it up, lay it down, or rearrange to your liking. They are sturdy enough to hold several things: shoes, baby bags, blanky, and more! I use them as cubbies for my kids so they can stuff the things that we take with us everyday in there. I love it, and I am planning on getting more.
__label__1	SOPHMORIC: I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL. I FOUND BOTH THE WRITING AND THE STORY LACKING AND UNIMAGINATIVE. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WITH AN INTEREST IN FANTASY THAT REVOLVES AROUND ELVES OR FEY. I WAS SORELY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S FEY HERITAGE. THE STORY ITSELF IS CHOPPY AND THE CHARACTERIZATION WEAK. A WASTE OF BOTH MONEY AND TIME. I WILL NOT BE READING ANY MORE OF THIS AUTHORS BOOKS.
__label__2	Better than the last one and the last one was good: This is the story of the brother of one of the secondary characters from the Leopard Lord. Farris is sold as a slave by his stepfather. Claimed by two very different gods, his fate will be decided on what he does with his life. Will he be ruled by vengeance and violence? Or will his love of the animals he tends lead him to a different choice? Ms Morland's characterization is excellent, the plotting is much improved (from good to even better). If I had a complaint, it would be that this book did not sweep me into a different world the way that the very best speculative fiction does. However, that said, it was a most enjoyable read, and I'll buy her next book, too.
__label__2	Very good read: I like this book much better than her last book, Leopard Lord. The author was able to empathize Farris' feeling and captured it for the reader. The supporting characters were very well written, including Farris' masters and mistress. The story was good enough to make me feel that it truely happened. I feel the author has real talent, and I will definitely buy her next book.
__label__2	"Sword and Shackel Is my fav.: Personaly this is one of my favorite books. It's one of those books you can read and re-read again and agiain, without getting sick of it. The way Farris is writtin and the way Alanna portrays him is awsome. Then the differennce you see from Farris-to-Bantam is wonderful. If you like reading books that don't hold back and make the characters seem above everything, but sound realistic but also adds magic in with that then, this is a book for you. This also isn't one of those constant blood-bath books or romance all the time books or the main ""character gets the girl everything turns out in the end"" books. It also doesn't have a tragic end were you begin to wish you'd never wasted your time on it. No when you finish reading this book you will NOT regret reading it. I've said to much. Oh, well. Read it and see for yourself if you agree with me!!!"
__label__2	Good. Kind of Corny.: Good book, kind of corny (who am I kidding, it was real corny after the first half). I like it.
__label__1	poor durability, hard to find replacement parts: I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement.
__label__2	This is really something special....: I've been studying music in the classical realm for a long time, but have always been interested in electronic music in both performance and composition. Of all the electronic I've heard from Kraftwerk to Daft Punk, I must say this is perhaps the best I have ever heard. This two-disc set is nothing less than magnificent. The formal structure and sheer smoothness of the sounds from minute 1 to 95 is how music SHOULD be heard in the preset day. I have played every Beethoven Sonata, the complete Etudes of Chopin, Islamey, Gaspard de la Nuit, on and on... As an experienced pianist and professional classical musician, I think I can safely say that these master composers would have GLADLY accepted Hawtin into their inner circle, if not for the plethora of distinct, yet related sounds, then for the complexity of the underlying formal structure that holds the entire soundscape together. This is a modern master-work. Don't miss the chance to experience it...
__label__2	"a tapestry of subltle sonic elements: I have been listening to techno for over 20 years (since I lived in Detroit in the late 80's) and Richie Hawtin is still producing some of the best progressive music of the genre. The varied rhythms are layered with such delicate precision that I need a better sound system to truly appreciate all the nuances. A couple of the tracks had some silly ""lyrics"" that I felt marred an otherwise excellent mix by the Minimal Master."
__label__1	An Album Minimalist in Genre AND Enjoyment: As a fan of minimalist electronica, I had to check this album out. I much prefer this end of electronica's spectrum versus sets or albums containing tracks which solely attempt to squeeze in as many beats per minute possible.However it is much more difficult to make an entire set of minimalist electronica work. As planned, 28 tracks, one transitioning into the next so that there seems to be no beginning or end. Just one long 75 minute track. Sounds great, but the result is very unimpressive. Hawtin's track selection is just plain terrible, and is the predominant reason that this album is so poor.2.5/5 stars.
__label__1	Poor Quality Products by Rooster LLC: This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market.
__label__2	"Fun swing jam session: This is a nice recording of swing and blues style guitar. Lots of fun to listen to -- like sitting in on a friendly jam session. Duke Robillard really shines on ""Avalon"" and the bluesier numbers and Herb Ellis sounds like he's having fun throughout. Recommended for swing fans or those new to jazz guitar."
__label__2	"Love da stuff: I can't pick up my own guitar without trying to play some of the lines Duke puts together on these numbers! He really smokes on ""Easin' In"". Unlike what some others may say, I think his swing chops are awreet and that the major problem here is that Herb Ellis is a little stale and staccato, but that's only compared with the Herb of yesteryear. This album is a fine excursion into this genre of jazz/blues and will be appreciated by more than just a purist jazz or blues oriented audience. Buy it and enjoy!"
__label__2	One Who Appreciates Good Guitar Jazz: Veteran guitarist Herb Ellis and and a somewhat newcomber guitarist Duke Roubillard showcase some fine jazz guitar interplay.Even if you're not a jazz fan, you'll appreciate this fine playing. This quintet presents three Roubillard originals with four standards.You'll hear the similarity between this album and the Great Guitar albums from past years. A fine addition to any guitar jazz lover's collection.
__label__2	Great swing: The reviewer who put down Robillard's playing on this has got to have his head up his you know what! Duke Robillard really demonstrates his swing chops on this one - Duke is a master of many styles including blues in the style of the likes of T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Magic Sam, you name it - and jazz in the style of Charlie Christian - He has a very hard hitting swinging style and he comes up with interesting musical ideas in each of his solos. Herb, of course, is a terrefic soft-spoken jazz guitarist. Like Jim Hall he always has subtle tricks up his sleeve. This is by no means a perfect cd - but my rage at the other review has pushed it from a 4 to a 5. It is a fun listen!
__label__2	"I can't stop playing this CD.: You can't like electric guitar and not love this CD. It's smooth, jazzy, and bluesy all at the same time. If you liked the music in the film ""Bull Durham"" you'll be in heaven."
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas VHS: I have This Charlie Brown VHS,Charlie brown in hindsight looking at his attitude is depressing, but it brings back alot of memories, who didn't watch Charlie brown growing up? no Matter the age. Who hasn't seen a Charlie Christmas Special. or other holiday specials? It's great viewing for all ages.
__label__2	Oldie But Goodie: I still enjoy this cartoon as much as I did when I was a kid. The message is still a classic, and the music is timeless. A great way to turn back the clock and experience a simpler time, if only for 20 minutes.
__label__2	The true meaning of Christmas, for kids: A Charlie Brown Christmas is my personal favorite Christmas movie for children of all time. The movie is entertaining and funny, just as the peanuts movies always are. Mostly, though, I love the fact that this movie pulls no punches when dealing with the over commercialization of a sacred holiday. Indeed, the movie comes together with Linus quoting from sacred scripture after Charlie Brown asks in frustration what the true meaning of Christmas really is.If you are parent who wants an entertaining Christmas movie for your kids that doesn't attempt to gloss over the true meaning of Christmas by using gushy messages about peace on earth and family togetherness, but gets right to the point of Christ's birth, consider a Charlie Brown Christmas. You won't be disappointed.
__label__2	Great show, but no need for blu-ray: I bought this show in the blu-ray edition expecting an incredible picture, but there was nothing special about it at all. The extras are nice but not what I buy DVDs for. There's no reason to waste your money buying the blu-ray edition. They didn't have HD technology when this special was produced and they can't change that. Buy the regular DVD and save your money.
__label__1	Wonderful Show, but a Very Poor Version: Let me say first that, yes, like you, I too adore this warm, wonderful Christmas classic. No Christmas would seem complete without it. But it is *because* I love this show (and otherwise would give it five stars without hesitation) that I'm forced to give a one-star review of this particular 2008 remastered/deluxe version. The reason? This new version is out of sync. In other words, the mouth movements of the characters as they speak no longer properly match the actual voices you hear on the audio track. If you already own this version, watch yours carefully; you'll see what I mean. There's a noticeable lag. If you're considering buying this DVD, you might want to wait until Warner Bros. gets its team back to the drawing board and amends this annoying error. Perhaps such a flaw won't bother some viewers; but if you're like me, it will detract from the beauty of this classic every time you watch.
__label__2	Oh Mr Schultz, how I love thee: A Charlie Brown Christmas. Does this REALLY need a review. Who doesn't love CB?? Whaa whaa whaa whhhaaaaaa. So glad I finally purchased this.
__label__2	Love this movie: I grew up with this movie and was happy to find in on a DVD. Glad to be able to get it at a good price
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas [VHS]: This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas: I haven't seen this in years, and bought it on a whim to surprise my family with a christmas eve special treat. It was just as touching and funny as I remembered it to be. We all enjoyed it. I don't remember ever seeing the second christmas program. It was fun to watch, but no where near as good as the first program. This is something we will definitely watch again during future holiday seasons.
__label__2	"a classic: Call me nostalgic, but this Christmas video remains one of the top Cartoons of all time. Children of all ages can relate to Charlie Brown's life as a misfit as well as his bewilderment over Christmas ""Commercialism"". His desire to be accepted and his quest for the true meaning of Christmas touch your heart.The early 2 dimensional animation is classic. Even children born with today's 3D computer animation are attracted to it. -And Vince Giraldi's music is jazz at it's classiest."
__label__2	It's not Christmas without Charlie Brown: Well let me tell you I am a big fan of A Charlie Brown Christmas! It just puts you in such a good mood! Charlie Brown the loser we all love to love teaches us the real meaning of Christmas with the help of Snoopy, Lucy and all the gang. This just sums up the happiness that Christmas brings to me... And contains the very cool Snoopy Dance! Check it out to help you get in touch with your inner child and find that holiday spirit!
__label__2	Christmas present: I ordered this DVD & several others as presents. They all arrived in good shape & on time for Christmas morning.
__label__2	Something I'll Never Grow Tired Of!!: For years and years, I always had to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas on broadcast television. I could never miss it! I finally missed it this year, and had to buy the DVD. Now, I will still watch it, even in the dead of summer. Even though there's nothing extra on the DVD, it's still fun to have it around for whenever you feel like watching it! A must have for kids and adults, alike!
__label__2	"The greatest Christmas story every: This is the greatest Christmas story every made or told. I only buy ""Charlie Brown"" Christmas trees now. My wife hates them but she doesn't understand what Christmas is all about."
__label__2	Charlie Brown delights as always: The new blu ray version of A Charlie Brown Christmas is excellent. The colors are superb, the sound too. And none of the original charm is lost. Highly recommended.
__label__2	Charlie Brown Christmas: I ordered this for my grand daughter with the hopes that she will fall in love with Peanuts and Snoopy and she will want all my collectibles someday!
__label__2	They need more stars...: We can only hope more classics as precious and timeless as this are in our future. A must see every Christmas.
__label__2	Great Buy: I was looking for clarity and a picture that would completely fill my HD television screen without manipulation. I found it with this DVD and couldn't be happier.
__label__1	just 1 peanuts movie!??!!: Honestly, if you knew about the blu-ray format and the capacity 1 disc has you should be appalled that there isn't the entire peanuts collection on 1 disc. This is such a obvious marketing plot to extort more money out of the consumer. If you buy this disc you are only feeding into that disgraceful behavior. If you don't know, blu-rays can hold more than 10 times the amount of content a DVD can hold. The entire peanuts movie collection can fit on to one blu-ray disc and to seperate them over 10+ discs just takes more money from you to send their fat kids to college. A pox on both your houses.
__label__1	"Insulting RIP OFF: With the over 50 GIGS of memory on a Blu-Ray, Paramount could easily fit the first 11 or 12 TV Specials on one disc, but being the crooks they are, they prefer to screw the American consumer by retailing 29.99 for ONE 25 minute episode, one 12 minute interview and a sub par ""Christmas Special"" made 20 years AFTER the original masterpiece. Shameful."
__label__2	The Best of Charlie Brown...: What else can I say? All that love CB should own this DVD. I love Charlie Brown and this is a true Christmas classic.
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas: Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan.
__label__2	If you don't like this movie, you're just flat wrong!!: Christmas is about more than santa and presents. It's more than just the biggest tree with the best decorations. It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.God Bless Charlie Brown!
__label__2	Withstands the Passage of Time: This program is as wonderful this year as it was the very first year I saw it. I watched it on my Kindle Fire last night and could not get over just how clear the picture was and how crisp the sound was. I enjoyed and appreciated the extra programing after the main show, but the newer shows will never be as good to me as the original! I actually missed the advertiser and advertisements that sponsored the program in the first years ;-)Streaming this from my Kindle to my TV will allow for the rest of the family to watch...and did you ever think, when you watched this for the very first time, that you would watch this on your own personal TV (tablet/android/phone) and then stream it to your big screen TV? I know I never would have dreamed of such a thing!
__label__2	Merry Christmas Charlie Brown: One of the best Christmas movies ever made the story is so true about everyone forgetting the real meaning of Christmas. I have the book and the movie and you can watch it all year I never get tired of it.
__label__2	Great Christmas Classic: I loved this movie as a kid and still enjoy it. With the remastered deluxe edition the color is great.
__label__2	Great movie!: Great movie from my childhood! Looks great on DVD. I thought it would look like an old movie, but it doesn't.
__label__2	Good movie: This is a classic and always good. I used it for my students in class as Charlie Brown never goes out of style.
__label__2	Holiday Tradition: when I was growing up, during the week before Thanksgiving, I would pull out my copy of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' and would watch it constantly until Christmas, its one of my FAVORITE holiday movies of all time. I recently started my own tradition with my little ones by introducing them to this movie, and each year as the holidays start to arrive they beg me to pull it out and we watch it every day until Christmas.
__label__1	"Digital Copy not compatible with iPod or Macs (""Windows Media only""): Classic TV special, but the promise of a ""digital copy"" is misleading. On the back of the cardboard slipcover, in tiny print, is listed this limitation: ""Windows Media-compatible only."" It is implausible that a consumer would come across this disclaimer when making a purchase decision based in part on the overtly advertised inclusion of a ""digital copy,"" a term most consumers associate with the ability to view media on an iPod."
__label__2	"Christ is the Center of Christmas: Thank God that Charles Shultz was alive before the ""politically correct"" ambassadors of the world decided that we have to celebrate commercialism rather than Christ at Christmas. This is a delightful collection of winter and holiday vignettes that culminate in a wonderful Christmas celebration that has become a classic like Miracle on 34th Stree and It's a Wonderful Life. Parents should watch this with their whole families as it has appeal for all generations."
__label__2	Classic!: This is one of the few Christmas specials that is still aired every year and is one that drove my mom crazy when I was young because she found Charlie Brown to be annoying. After forty-seven-years since it debuted, it still receives millions of viewers. It is one of the few cartoons that gives kids the real meaning of Christmas.
__label__2	Linus tells us what Christmas is all about: Charlie Brown wants to know what Christmas is all about and Linus has the answer. Can you imagine any other show daring to give that same answer today? Just a gentle reminder from Charles Schulz that the simplest answers are always the best.
__label__2	This is a Christmas Classic for all Ages: I have watched this wonderful movie every year since I was 8 or 9. It never fails to get me and my family in the Christmas spirit. No matter how many times you watch it, you never get bored with it.
__label__2	"Great Christmas Classic: I used to watch ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" every year as a child and now my kids love to watch it. Even now, I'll sit and watch it with them-anytime of year. More importantly, this Christmas story emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas-something I'm happy to have my children watching."
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas Is Very Good!: Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!
__label__2	Charlie Brown Christmas: Great. Gives you a pause to remember the real meaning of Christmas. Nostalgic and well loved. Without the glitz and flash of so much that modern Christmas has become. Simple and straight forward, young to old can enjoy it.
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas: What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is a classic....My 4 yr old granddaughter saw it for the first time and fell in love with Snoopy.
__label__1	D'oh: Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that's foolish. This was our purchase this year. Thankfully we got a 50% credit for making the purchase (not sure what promotion it was since I didn't see it) and we got $1 toward Amazon MP3s. So our foolishness was credited, but before you buy this always remember that it airs on tv every year (in our case 3 days after we purchased it). If we had checked our TV guide we would have seen it and been able to record it for free. Buyer beware.Don't buy it.
__label__1	Amazon says 50 minutes: while in fact it is only 25, as specified on the DVD. I am OK with the price I paid for 50 minutes. NOT for 25. If Amazon gave the right specs I would not have bought it. Now I cannot even return it, cause returning anything from Croatia is too expensive. So I am stuck with most expensive per-minute DVD in my collection. And the fact that I overpaid it is gonna be buggin me, and I'm gonna feel cheated for a long long time. Bad business, Amazon. Bad business. PS someone wrote 20 min in their review, 5 weeks after I ordered. Bummer.
__label__1	"Don't listen to the others!: Absolutely awful.I watched this Christmas special with an effort. When I think of bad Christmas movies, it's Santa Claus (1961), Santa with Muscles, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and A Charlie Brown Christmas.I can't believe this won an Emmy, Hollywood's most famous TV award! I would have to be on drugs in order to recognize it as such.I beggar you not to listen to the others! It's not a Christmas classic, they're lying. How can a Christmas movie have touching up on a perfectly innocent tree, teasing C.B. because of the Christmas tree, and Lucy at the end saying dialogue that I try to forget:""Charlie Brown IS a blockhead...but he gave us a nice tree.""Something that Ed Wood would perpetrate, in my highly professional opinion."
__label__1	W O R S T MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!: THE worst adiuo and bad story line. What'a waste of my hard worth cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2	It always take me back.: This is a movie that will always take me back when I was a kid sitting in my front living room with my dad in his lounge chair and my mom sewing on the couch, and of course me watching Charlie Brown and filling soooo sorry for him because he tried to decorate a little dying christmas tree. A truely great movie for all ages.
__label__1	Not worth an upgrade: If you already have this on DVD, don't waste your money upgrading to blu. The picture quality is only slightly better, it's not widescreen and the biggest disappointment is that the sound is the same as on the DVD. I gave it 2 stars only because it's Charlie Brown (the show itself is worth more than 5 stars!), it's a shame they didn't take the time or spend a few dollars to make the disc worthy of the title.
__label__2	A Charlie Brown Christmas: This movie is awesome! It comes with bonus footage, and it arrived so fast! It was my first time using amazon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a product they are having a hard time finding in stores.
__label__2	Best x-mas movies of all time: Top 10: A must have for your collection, It has both the original and the second version of it. Highly recommend, nothing better than getting warm around the holidays and watching this one.
__label__2	the best table: This is a workhorse table with a guarantee---how can you go wrong? Mine are used in a pottery studio where students can work on their clay creations. Owned mine for more than five years and can't even think of a problem with these tables. They clean up well and are very sturdy. I like the leg design because I have yet to stub a toe on these tables. Don't hesitate to get this line of products; you won't be sorry.
__label__2	Clean: Excellent copy and shipped fast. This is one of the books that I have been waiting to read. clean book.
__label__1	"An ""iffy"" purchase..: As the previous user stated, this is obviously a bootleg album. You can tell by the artwork (most notably the pixelated image on the front cover) as well as the mis-spelled songs on the back cover.I rarely ever purchase these sorts of CDs, but in this case I did only to have something in the car when I don't have my Ipod with me."
__label__2	"Too firm for me: I bought this for a lot more money at the Relax The Back store. Amazon has a much better price. I like the design of it but it has some flaws. The pillow case is hard to get onto the pillow and stretches taught right where I'd like to rest my head making it a bit uncomfortable. Also the lower ""legs"" of the product are much too firm to have between my knees. It raises my leg up too high and hurts my hip. I'm 5'7"" so this isn't a problem of being too petite. A flat spot has formed within a few days where I have to lift it open to get in and out of bed. I still like it and haven't found anything comparable."
__label__2	Helpful in early pregnancy: I am using this pillow now and about to enter my second trimester. I find the pillow to be comfortable and useful in training myself to sleep on my side. I actually find the pillow most comfortable upside down (with the connected piece at my feet). This allows me to use the side bolsters, elevate my feet, AND use my own pillow.
__label__2	Love it!: I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed.
__label__2	Love it!: I am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides. At first, I was scared of the size and concerned it might bother my husband and my little dog that sleeps next to me. I tried it and absolutely loved it. My husband cuddles up next to it and my little dog uses the pillow as well and sleeps in it with me. We joke around about the size, but it is really comfortable. It is a must have during pregnancy.
__label__2	Exactly What I Wanted: I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. I am pregnant and have recently gotten to the point that I just cannot get comfortable in bed. I have had this pillow a week now and I absolutely love it. It was worth every penny. It's like sleeping in a nest, it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable.
__label__1	Helps . . . With reservations: This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. Overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment, I end up using it only occasionally.
__label__2	U Body Pillow: This allows my wife to have support on all sides during sleep. She now can sleep through the night with waking. This is an exellent buy and well worth the investment.
__label__1	Very disappointed, no cover: Its very strange that the comfort-u pillow did not go with a cover. This is the 3rd comfort-u support pillow I have, and for the first 2 plain white cover was always included in the box at the same price$99.5.
__label__2	Excellent condition and service: I thought I already reviewed this but will do so again. Thanks so much for excellent service. Book in great condition. Very nice doing business with you, I appreciate it!
__label__1	"Don't Buy this if you have a 17"" Powerbook G4!: This power adapter has only half the Amp rating needed to power the powerbook G4 17"". It took 14 hours to charge the battery and still used the battery partially when the computer was in use and the power was connected though the adapter. I noticed that they left out the Amps it has in the advertising. The other reviews below must be fake or they have a smaller G4 powerbook or an iBook."
__label__1	"DO NOT BUY FOR G4 12"" POWERBOOK: In a complaint to Macally regarding intermittent charging, their response was:Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4Thank you for contacting us.Our PS-AC4 has problem with the 12"" PowerBook G4. At this moment, we do not have any working one for your computer."
__label__1	Not even a day...: I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous.
__label__1	Not for iBook G4: Be careful. The box packing for this says it works with a PowerBook G4 or an iBook G3. It will not work for a iBook G4. The Amazon product page does not make that clear.
__label__1	Inconsistent charging since purchase: I am on my third cord, after returning it twice (within one year!). This cord doesn't charge consistently, and so it makes your screen flicker, and music and videos skip. You have to fiddle with the cord for 10 minutes to even get it to charge at all sometimes. Believe me, it's not worth the lower cost for this - just get a more expensive one that actually works.
__label__1	third one is now broken: I've now been through three of these cords. they seem to last around a year before just dying. The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer, however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall. The little indicator just fades out, and now won't come on at all. Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better. I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well.
__label__1	"I wouldn't buy this again.: This power adapter charges my 17"" Powerbook G4 excruciatingly slowly and, now 6 months after purchase, it doesn't always even charge.Flakey charging issue: Recently, I have to keep unplugging and replugging from the middle block to get power to the computer! So now I guess I'm going to have to buy a new Apple power adapter for approximately $80.Slow charge issue: My computer gets down to about 80% charged and it can take a couple of hours to power back to 100% (while I'm using it). I'm wondering if it charges more slowly because the cord that goes into the wall has two prongs instead of three. ??? I never had problems charging quickly with the Apple brand."
__label__1	Consider not buying this product: Bought this guy for a Mac PowerBook G4 Titanium (the description clearly states this power supply works for the PowerBook G4). Never worked. Couldn't say if this is a fluke or if they are all of comparable quality.
__label__2	Just what that old computer needed: This adapter was just what we needed to put new life into our old Mac. The power now stays on to allow for hours of use. It works great! Thanks!
__label__1	"You are not saving any money: You aren't saving any being this adapter. I purchased this for a 12"" G4 Powerbook. The power it supplies goes on and off constantly. This can't be good for the computer. It certainly doesn't charge it. Don't waste your money on this Macally adapter. Try to find an original Apple adapter if you can."
__label__2	EXCELLENT!!!: Great spare power supply, the only con' is the excess of weat generated when you use it for a long time... but works great!
__label__1	DON'T BUY IT!: Ever since I bought this and charged my ibook with it, my ibook hasn't worked! Don't buy it.
__label__2	Works like a charm: The only feature missing from the Apple version of this is the light in the plug tip that confirms it is seated well and shows the charging status. I can live without it for the $70 I saved.
__label__2	A worthy replacement: If you're willing to trade a little style for some substance and save some money in the bargain, this is a very recommendable device. My Apple PowerBook power supply died in what is apparently typical fashion - sparking, crumbling wire where it meets the brick - and none of the Apple stores or CompUSAs in Atlanta had any in stock (which is curious in itself). I resorted to Amazon and decided to try this one out and I've been pretty happy with it. It seems sturdily constructed, and the breakaway cable is a surprisingly handy way to save on tangles. I do miss the plug-in charging light, but that's about it.
__label__1	junk: As others have experienced, mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening, and probably no good at all for the battery. Don't buy.
__label__1	"All these adapters have a very short life...: This adaptor and Apple's adaptor are not going to live long. They are all pretty worthless, except for the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE ONE.I just buy the cheapest 65 watt adaptors I can find (for both 15"" iBook G4 and 17"" PowerBook G4) and plan to replace them within 6 months. Every now and then I find them for $20 - 40.00, and buy 2 to 4 at a time. Next time I'll buy a new laptop with the magnetic plug! Am very disappointed in Apple. I love my Mac, but quality is definitely going down."
__label__2	Macally Macintosh Powerbook adapter: I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running. All 3 have worked without problem (sometimes the cord comes loose so you have to check that it is tight). No LED on the connector to indicated charging as with the original Apple adapter. Won't work on the new Intel MacBook or MacBook Pro.
__label__1	Died after 4 months and tech support is horrible...: I read the reviews before purchasing this adapter, and I guess I simply got a dud. That happens, but the tech support is horrible. The support staff was very unhelpful and told me it would take weeks to replace.The other adapter replacements don't seem much better, given the poor reviews for Kensington's model.Just hope you don't get a dud.
__label__1	"Don't buy if you have a 12"" G4 Powerbook: I bought this adapter for my 12-inch G4 powerbook, one of the computers listed as compatible with this AC adapter. The specs all match up and it SHOULD work. But it didn't. The power would fluctuate and the computer would go back and forth between AC power and battery power, making the screen flicker and the battery never charged. I contacted MacAlly and they said they're aware of the problem but don't have a solution. Their answer to the problem was to return it, which I did.If even MacAlly admits it doesn't work, they really shouldn't keep selling it. All I can do is say don't buy this AC adapter."
__label__2	Good replacement for old charger: This is a good replacement for the Apple Charger. Only a couple of notes to make.1. The blue light doesn't indicate whether the notebook is charging or not, only if the cord is plugged into the outlet. This means that you can't really tell what is going on unless you open your laptop and make sure the indicator is showing that it is charging.2. If you drain your battery fully, so your laptop goes to sleep BE WARNED... You will not be able to plug it in and resume working right away. I had to plug it in and let it charge up for a good while before I could operate my Powerbook again, pulling power to operate the computer and charge the battery. This has been most annoying.Other than those weird gripes, it is a sufficient power adapter.
__label__1	Does not work with ibook G4: This product does not work with my ibook G4. As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers, the charger toggles between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if it is left on, it will continuously charge. I thought about keeping it, but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $10 more.This one is going back to Amazon.
__label__1	It stopped working after a few weeks: It worked well for a few weeks, but then the battery of my iBook G4 stopped being re-charged.
__label__2	good, cheap product: This product is about half the price of that offered from apple. It does not have a charge light, but for me it isn't worth the price. Product charges the battery, which is all I am looking for.
__label__1	Be careful - product has changed?: I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4. The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky.
__label__2	"Excellent replacement: You'd think for such a high-end, costly ""entry-level"" laptop, buying a replacement part would be affodable. This isn't the case with the apple ibooks. The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me."
__label__1	High Pitched Noise: I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises.
__label__2	Great Value: This charger is much sturdier than the mac version (which my cat chewed through in a matter of days). I'd read another review that said this adapter didn't work on the aluminum PowerBooks, but it works great for mine. In addition, the product arrived in about one day. I ordered it on a Friday morning and received it on Saturday before noon. I would highly reccomend this product.
__label__2	works fine: I have an 'old' ibook from 2001, white, and even though it says for G4 on the package of the charger, it works just fine with mine. I actually like it better than the original one from Mac, smaller and somewhat handier. Glad I didn't have to pay 80$ to fix that ! :-)
__label__1	Doesn't work properly: Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife's iBook G4, it does not charge them when in operation. It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in, but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off. I'd give this a one star, but at least it powers them when they're on, even without the charging.
__label__1	"Bad Product: Cycling on and OFF: Nice form factor etc...but bad function. Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12"" when it is off or asleep, but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick. Try another product."
__label__1	mine broke after 6 months: my ac adapter broke down as well, the tip going into the computer simply fell out of the plastic plug. don't get it. it's basically $40 wasted.
__label__1	The adapter shown is not the one that was shipped.: I received a different adapter so I cannot really tell you about the Macally adapter. I received an adapter from Inspire and it does not have the longer cord, the velcro strap or the led lights. But it does charge my computer and it arrived quickly.
__label__1	research before you buy: This adaptor does not work with the dual USB iBook. It looks like a good product, but the plug doesn't fit.
__label__2	good cheap alternative: The only downside to this adapter vs. apple's is the lack of the light ring which tells you whether the computer is fully charged or not. Otherwise it's a great deal!
__label__1	Update - Adapter broke!: I take back my previous comments as now this adapter is dead, and MUCH faster than my original one. I await Macally's response to my request for a new one.
__label__1	NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4: I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY.
__label__1	NOT FOR iBOOK G4: Look carefully at the pictures for this product. The initial picture, without the brand name and with a blue LED light, is the product that works on iBook G4. The customer photos show a completely different product, one that is not recommended for use on iBook G4. I did not receive the product in the initial picture, but thankfully I noticed this before I opened the package (the package says iBook G3) and I called the support line. They said I had not received the right product and could not guarantee that the product would work correctly --or at all, so I ordered a replacement through Amazon. Still, I did not get the right product. Amazon told me they would stop selling this product as there is a problem with what is being shipped. I got my money back and went to our local Mac 2nd party store to find something reliable for the G4.
__label__1	note to self: read reviews before buying: I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this.
__label__1	Worst Charger Ever!: I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 iBook G4. The description page has nothing stating that it is not for ibook G4 but only for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3. Also, after only about 3 weeks of use the charger died completely. This is by far the worst charger I have ever had. Pros: quick ship Cons: incorrect description, lack of durability
__label__1	works when ur Powerbook G4 is turned off: this charger does not have enough power to charge my Powerbook G4 while it is running. it will show the charger indicator back and forth from battery power to charging.But when I charge while it is off, it works perfect.I had requested a replacement once and the result was still the same.
__label__1	Problems: I have been very unhappy with this product because it:1) makes a high pitched buzz2) intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power.3) the cord is difficult to wrapI'll be trying to return it through the warranty process, but I wish I had just coughed up the [lots of] extra money to buy an Apple one.
__label__1	quit working after a month: Well, it was a good deal and seemed to work well for a month! But after the stated time it quit. I noticed that the charging/battery guage on the tool bar was flickering back and forth and noticed a quiet humming sound coming from the power adapter. Since I live in Eastern Europe and someone brought this here from the US for me to use as a second adapter (to use at work) it will be hard to return. Maybe it was a fluke, but now I'm down to the original adapter and no backup. Hope you have better luck.
__label__1	Faulty product: I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. After three months and only sporadic use, the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously. This isn't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in, but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds, then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on. I contacted the company, which confirmed it was faulty, so I sent it back to them for replacement. I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months, the second one started doing the same thing. I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product. I suppose there is a reason that it's a third the cost of the Apple product.
__label__1	Defective product, bad service: I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive.
__label__1	good price... questionable quality: I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac's (ridiculously priced)$80 charger. At first it worked pretty good, but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should. i think there is some kind of warranty, so i should try and exchange it...but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second, then stop for one second, charge for one second, stop for one second, etc. It still manages to charge the computer, but im not sure if all this onoff stuff is necessarily good for my computer...
__label__2	"Durable and functional replacement to the Apple-branded charger: This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack's Apple's green & orange light around the charging tip. To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15"" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms. And I prefer this one much more over Apple's when traveling. Highly recommend!"
__label__2	Thank you for making an affordable Adaptor: The adaptor that comes with the Apple Powerbook did not last as long as it should have! Then to charge that expensive cost for replacement...Shame on them! I accidentally dropped and bent the first adaptor that I bought from you and replaced it and still have enough left over to buy another if needed!!! WHY? Apple?
__label__2	Better than the Apple adapter: We got our PowerBook in July of 2003 and had to replace the Apple adapter twice. I finally got fed up with the flimsy cord and purchased this Macally PS-AC4 adapter and I am very happy with the quality of the product. We've been using this for months and the only complaint (which is why the 4 stars and not 5) is that we miss seeing the little light around the end of the cord that plugs into the PowerBook that indicates the charge status (the one that glows orange or green). I would highly recommend this replacement to anyone, as long as you can live without the status light. At this price, it is hands down a better alternative to the delivered cord.
__label__1	Defective twice: I used one Macally charger for my G4 for a month before it died and stopped charging my computer. Amazon replaced the product and my second one lasted one day. I returned it and am now using an apple charger.
__label__1	Check your package!: I read the reviews on this site and noticed that some said they received the wrong product. After looking at mine i noticed i too had been slipped the Inspire adapter, not the Macally that i ordered (which is far superior to the cheap knock off). I have been trying to contact Clear AV but they are never available..am off to contact Amazon next.
__label__1	Faulty Product - Horrible Support: I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization.
__label__2	Good value: At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40.
__label__2	Save the money!: I got my second one of these recently. Now I keep a charger at work and another at home so I don't have to carry them back and forth. The one at home has been in use for a year now with no problems; they're more durable than the Apple ones at a fraction of the cost.
__label__1	JUNK JUNK JUNK: This charger is horrible. Worked for long enough for me not to be able to get my money back from Amazon. Makes the screen blink while charging and flashes back and forth from charging to not charging. Customer service at this company is horrible. After waiting two weeks for a response they wanted me to send it back before I get a new one. Who knows how long that will take. I am probably going to have to trash this waste of money for the more expensive Apple one. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1	Shock Treatment: An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item, so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective, though not stylish. Unfortunately, we have had problems. The Powerbook started delivering electrical shocks and inconsistent charging with this adapter, and they got worse when we moved to a country on 240V. I know that the shock problem comes from the Macally adapter because I have another PB and an original Apple power supply, so can do all combinatorial tests. I like Macally and have several of their other products. I probably just got a bum unit but unfortunately cannot deliver a positive review based on previous experience with the company.
__label__1	Good for a few months: The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge.
__label__1	Bate and Switch: We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!
__label__2	great alternative: I was dismayed when the adaptor that came with my ibook gave out. I was even more dismayed when I checked the prices for replacements online.I chanced upon this while browsing amazon and it is such a great alternative buy. The cord is longer than the mac adaptor. The size is manageable. While it doesn't have the indicator light around the edge of the cord, the price is much much better than the ones made by mac.It seems so much sturdier and durable too.
__label__1	Doesn't hold up to my backpack: I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged, exposing the outer wire. I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse. I'm sure this won't be an issue if you aren't traveling with it, but I just thought I would relate my experience.
__label__1	Cheap quality and non-existant service: After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.
__label__2	Affordable: I wasn't sure this was spec'd for my G3 IBook, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. I'm hoping it'll be a backup for my G4 Powerbook too. It works fine. Seems to load up my battery as quickly as the original AC adapter; it's lighter and seems to be more compactable -- easier to carry around. I'd recommend it.
__label__1	They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews!: I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here.
__label__1	Garbage Product - Stay Far Away: I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice.
__label__1	Poorly made product: The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook. I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!
__label__2	Besides vanity reasons, there's no reason to buy another Apple adapter: I got the Macally power cord after the Apple one that came with my iBook finally broke down 2 years after purchase. I will agree that this model isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the Apple version, and I do miss having the orange and green indicator light to let me know that my computer is charging, but the difference between $30 and $80 is enough that I'm willing to give up the eye candy for the price. The Macally power adapter charges my computer just as well as the Apple version, it just doesn't look pretty while it does it. Also, it's a bit bulkier and takes up more space in my laptop bag. Still, the $50 I saved makes it worth the added weight. Unless you have serious reasons for buying the Apple power adapter (eg, vanity), I would go ahead and get the Macally version. Your pocketbook will thank you, and you can spend the extra money on other Apple extras.
__label__1	You get what you pay for.: I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4. It lasted me about a year and a half. I opted for this Macally charger, for two reasons, 1. the price 2. the great reviews on Amazon. I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional. Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger, but it really comes out to the same price, considering that an apple charger costs about $90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $30 and lasts six months.
__label__1	Faulty Power Cord: I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead.
__label__1	Mishap: Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died. Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS.$40.- down the drain!
__label__2	MaC POWER Adapter: Works fine on the PowerBook G4. Doesn't have an LED to tell you it's on and, of course, doesn't have a smart plug to show charging status.
__label__2	Apple G4 Power Cord: I just bought my second one. We have 3 Macs at our house and the cords do not hold up. I dreaded replacing them but I like my computer. I tried this the last time my cord went and it worked great, so when the most recent power cord fell apart I did not hesitate. It does the same job at a third of the price!
__label__1	you'll be sorrry!: After 4.5 months, the adapter died. I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1. the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire!2. I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate--I would be without a power cord for a week. They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately, I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord.
__label__2	Solid Value-Conscious Replacement Power Adaptor: After going through 2 OEM Apple adaptors, and deciding that I can't justify my budget for power adaptors going through the roof, I decided to try this adaptor.After a month of use, I have to say I am well pleased. This is a great price for a simple product. (Really, how complicated can a power adaptor be?)PRO: It is solid white (although the picture makes it seem not to be) just most like apple products and it does the simple task of powering my PowerBook.CON: It does not have the LED lighting at the base like the OEM does, but this is only a small loss.This is a great value minded replacement. I really can't say you would have any different experience with a Apple adaptor for over twice as much...
__label__1	Level 2 NOC tech: its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerbook. the connector that plugs in to the powerbook fits , but the connection itself is unstable and easily disrupted by just a little wiggle or touch of the cable or connector. If you are looking for a replacement cable go with Apple branded. that one works .
__label__1	Macally Power cord: Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer. They will only send me a replacement but won't give me my money back. Not worth the risk. Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
__label__1	Only lasts 6 months: I bought this power adapter and it worked just fine at first. I took good care of it and after about six months it just stopped working.
__label__1	lemon!: just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger.All this charger does is allow me to turn on the computer (sometimes), it does NOT charger my powerbook g4.
__label__1	Defective: I just got the adapter today, I plugged it into my iBook G4, and I was able to turn it on, but the battery doesn't charge, and after a minute or two, the screen dims and the laptop goes to sleep. Buyers beware! You might consider an official Apple adapter!
__label__1	When it worked it was great: I had this charger for over two years. Last week while it was plugged into my computer, it just died. No blue light no current. I ended up splicing the connector to my old frayed Apple charger. The connector is much better than Apple's.
__label__2	"Better than Mac's charger: Like some other reviewers, the product I received did not look exactly like the one pictured. That's irritating. But, it functions perfectly, which is more than I can say for the expensive Mac chargers.Mac stores will tell you it's a ""myth"" that their chargers break. Um... why is it then that me, my brother, three friends and several acquaintances have had this problem?"
__label__2	Great price, works just as well as the Apple version: Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger. Its about $40 cheaper than the apple proprietary version and does the same exact thing -> power my laptop. Its not as fancy looking, however, and the cord is kind of stiff. But if you dont care about that sort of stuff then there is no reason to buy the overpriced apple version.
__label__1	Works great... for about a month: Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two.
__label__1	really low quality: i bought this product when my original ac adapter was destroyed by my dog. even at the price i paid, this was an awful product. most of the time i had to spend forever to jiggle the connecter into my mac to get it to even stay connected, and then it would just spontaneously stop charging and i have to jiggle again. it's awful! i never had any problem like that w/ my original mac ac adapter. it's gotten so frustrating that i think i'm going to take a hammer and smash it into pieces. and technical support doesn't reply my inquiries. do NOT buy this product, even if it seems cheap! stay away from it! look around on craigslist and buy a used adapter instead. this adapter is garbage
__label__1	Great for a SHORT TERM replacement...: I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason.
__label__1	Power connector is not durable: Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer. Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months, so I can't say I'm pleased. Macally says they'll sell the connector cable separately for $17.00 which is not much of a bargain.
__label__1	Terrible product. Broke twice. Don't buy!!!: Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.
__label__2	Such a deal!: I have had to replace my powerbook power cord twice already. Both times before I broke the bank by purchasing the cord from apple. Big mistake. Although steep in price those things are C-H-E-A-P! This last time i decided to go with the Macally. What a great deal! Much more durable than then apple version. It is also more compact. The only thing missing is the indicator light to let you know if the battery is charging. Not a big deal for such a great price!
__label__1	Be wary of this charger: I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it doesn't always seem to make a good connection with the computer. When this happens, it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop. I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection. While this is only an annoyance to me, I wonder what it's doing to the internals of my computer.
__label__2	Power Adapter for Apple G4: The cord works great. It's not as cool looking as the Apple Adapter and it does not have the light indicator, thats all I can say bad about it. Its $50 less than the Apple one so go buy it.
__label__2	Ibook Replacement Power Adapter: Although this is a wonderful working power adapter, I don't believe it is the Macally Adapter that was advertised. I am however happy with it and would shop with this vendor again.Thank you.
__label__2	"Does the job: This is a solid replacement for Apple's charger. It is light weight and does the job it was intended to do. Blue ""on"" light simply tells you it's plugged in, but there's no indicator to tell you when the computer is fully charged. Lacks the portability elegance of the Apple charger, but costs a lot less."
__label__2	Nice product: Works very well and at a very reasonable price. It is built a lot stouter than the Apple power supply it repaces and at less than half the cost. You might miss the light on the plug but it work fine witout it. I doubt that the light is worth an extra $50.00.
__label__2	iBook/Powerbook Power Adapter: So far so good. I have used power adapter since my Apple Adapter got a short in the cord. I have owned various Apple Laptops and almost all of the power adapters have needed replacing. I like to buy Apple branded replacements but they cost twice as much as this one. I have been using it for several weeks without any problems.
__label__2	better than apple: Much more durable than the Apple adapter (my Apple one broke in 2 months), and MUCH better priced. I think this is the best one around for the value. Only downside is that there is no indicator as to when it is charging (the Apple one has Green v. Amber color). All in all, a great buy.
__label__2	Good value, fair design: Purchased this to replace the OEM power adapter (puppy chewed it up). Works fine, does the job. A little bulkier than the OEM, and I would have liked the same type of LED system to indicate charging/fully-charged status. Still, for the price, it's just fine.
__label__2	MAC G4 power attack: This unit is well built and works really well. It was just used to startup from a drained battery(left my Mac on battery all nite..duh). Well, at 0% charged, I plugged this unit in and starting web browsing, in minutes the charge was at 2% and rising, as well as keeping up with the browsing demands. For the price, it cannot be beat. It also seems I keep forgetting to unplug the original charger when I pack to do travelling, so this new unit makes a great spare to keep packed in my laptop case.
__label__2	Works well: This charger is just what I needed to replace my Apple charger and it costs a whole lot less. The only recommendation is that you make sure to plug it into a surge protector as there is no third-prong ground on it.
__label__2	Works for me: I like this a lot - it does not bend at the junction the way the mac one does and the mac one almost encourages that break with the way the cord wraps up. This one has a super long cord (that I keep partially coiled). The only drawback is it doesn't have the green/red charge clue around the plug but you can always look at your screen to see what % charged you are.
__label__1	"Charging problems: I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12"" Powerbook G4. Unfortunately, it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off. If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in, it not only doesn't add charge, it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook. Wish I would've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger."
__label__1	Did not charge my G4 unless the laptop was closed!: Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop's battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed.It could keep the computer operating while plugged in, but it wouldn't charge my battery. I've seen other reviews with different results, but for me, this thing was pretty much useless.
__label__1	Doesn't work: Having the same problem as others mentioned here. Does not work on my iBook G4. Alternates between battery and power adapter.
__label__1	Worst Product I have ever got from Amazon: The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick, not true. It says it has an LED to show when it is charging, not true. It says it is for a PowerBook G4, not true (From the start I had to twist it to get it to tell my computer not charging. it doesn't have the power to charge). I returned the first one to get what was listed but Amazon sent the same thing out. I couldn't be bothered so I just stuck it in the corner.DO NOT GET IT, its too overpriced and doesn't do what it says. PRODUCT INFO IS FALSE!
__label__1	BAD PRODUCT, WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT BUY FROM MACALLY!: After two go bad experiences with this product, all I can say is do not buy anything from Macally, at all. The first AC adapter for my G4 laptop went bad within 6 months and the second AC adapter was shot in less than five. When I say this product is junk, I'm not exaggerating. Basically, when you started to hear a high pitch whine, that was all she wrote. Within a week or so, the unit was dead. After the second one went dead I contacted Macally's customer service representative which was an exercise in futility. I was stonewalled at every turn. I finally just asked them to send me a new unit and they demanded proof of purchase. I then offered to send the old unit in but they wanted a receipt. All of this for a twenty dollar AC adapter. I'm sure this guy has a lot of practice giving his customers the shaft by virtue of the other bad reviews for this product. Do yourself a huge favor and do not buy anything from Macally.
__label__1	sparked, then didn't work: We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day.
__label__1	Another defective one...: This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them.
__label__1	Disappointing and dangerous: Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!
__label__2	Nice low-cost option. Very pleased.: Very pleased with this product that I bought as a replacement for a worn out Apple power cable. Apple has changed their plug system with the newest machines, but for anyone out there with a Pre-Intel Mac this is a great option at half the price of Apple's own product. Only gripe is that there is no power indicator light on the plug end, which is a feature on Apple's stock power cord.
__label__2	Charges: This charger works great and charges as well as the apple product that costs twice as much. I miss the green and orange light at the end of the plug, but this one does have a blue light indicating it is plugged in.
__label__1	I was very disappointed with this book.: This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy.
__label__2	"Good but not great: Most of the characters were annoying in this book. I do like how each one got a chance to tell ""their"" side of the story.Not one of her best but still made for a pleasent read."
__label__1	A disappointment: Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard.
__label__2	A fractured Family Story: This story was quite sad initially but turned out OK in the end, I always think it very sad when families cannot respect and like each other.
__label__2	I love Binchy's work: This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant.
__label__2	Wonderful characterisation, as always: I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read.
__label__2	Easy read...entertaining.: As always a Maeve Binchy feel good story. Fast read but once I pickup any of her books, I cannot put down until I finish. Characters had depth. Would recommend any of her books.
__label__2	A True Story Teller: Maeve Binchy is a great storyteller. All of her books are filled with character description and are definately page turners. The Silver Wedding took me by suprise the way each character had different views on the same events which is usually true in real life. This is the seventh book of Binchy's that I have read and everytime I finish one, I can't wait to start the next. The Silver Wedding, although not my favorite of hers, lived up to my expectations of Bincy's marvelous ability to telling a story. Definately recommende d as a summer read. (or anytime!)
__label__2	Not bad, not her best either.: Even though I did enjoy this book, I was disappointed in the way some of the characters stories were left hanging, such as Father Hurley's nephew. What happened to him? The character of Helen REALLY got on my nerves. But then, she was probably supposed to. Overall, though, it was a good read.
__label__1	"A True and Total Dud: Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage... I started off with Binchy, relieved that these were not ""romance novels,"" but three or four books into her plethora, I find them to be glorified Barbara Cartlands. The difference is, in the more recent ones, they all sell food."
__label__2	Playdough fun!: This was purchased as a Holiday gift for our 2 1/2 year old. She is very artistic in nature, as are my other two older children (ages 9 & 11) and they all play together when this gets whipped out. It's great for when I need a little time to do some sewing to keep the kids busy for awhile.Sometimes mom gets in on the creative action as well, and then we end up playing for long times, strengthening our bonds.Much better than sitting in front of the TV or computer.The only subject I would mention that could use a little improvement is maybe an idea sheet, like a how to, to give the kids a jumping point on creativity with what is included in this package.
__label__2	play-doh: not bad but be warned you need to buy extra play-doh at local store before handing it to the kid's
__label__2	Cool tools for PLAYTIME FUN!: My daughter loves this caddy and really enjoys playing with playdoh ( she's 3 ). It has a lot of cool tools like scissors and a pizza cutter that are very toddler friendly. I think the caddy center island needed to be a bit bigger. We have other play doh sets and it doesn't all fit in the caddy.
__label__2	"Super fun: Rated for 3+ but my 2 and 3 yr. olds both play with this. While the kids like playing with this, I like that it can grow with them. It has basic tools for younger children: rolling pin, presser with three tips, pizza cutter, safety scissors, play-doh knife. But it also has tools/items for older ones: bead making, art molds for pictures and ""sand"".The only con is the mat. It's cheap plastic. Sounded great on the box in the store, but ends up crinkled underneath them and not protecting the floor. Stick with using and old sheet or vinyl table cloth from the $1 store."
__label__2	A very palatable foray into SciFi.: No spiritual experience like the Flat Earth, but I was won over by Esther's determination & vulnerability. A reminder of our humanity.
__label__2	DEVIN THE DUDE'S BIGGEST FAN!!!!!!!!!: DEVIN IS A GREAT RAPPER BUT WHO IS VERY UNDERRATED. I HAVE ALL OF HIS C.D. EVEN THOUGH HE DOSENT GET ALLOT A PLAY DOWN HERE IN JACKSONVILLE FLA. WAITIN TO EXHALE IS A GREAT AND FUNNY C.D. I WOULD RECOMMENED IT TO ANY ONE WHO LOVES DEVIN OR IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW OR WHO JUST WANTS TO KNOW WHO THE DUDE IT. EVEN THOUGH IN MAGAZINES IT SAYS THIS IS DEVINS BEST CD YET I THINK THAT THE OTHER 3 WERE BETTER. TO THE XTREMM , JUST TRYIN TO LIV AND THE DUDE ARE OFF THE CHAIN. I WOULD JUST RECOMMENED EVERYBODY TO GET THE DEVIN THE DUDE C.D. HE MAKES U LAUGH, AND ALSO IT GREAT MUSIC TO SMOKE TO!
__label__2	Great addition to a fan's collection: One thing that I have learned over the years is that it is very difficult to capture the same energy, audio and visual effects of a live show on a taped performance. Although I wasn't there, I have a feeling that the flat vocals were largely due to that fact. I have been to several live shows that were mind blowing only to see the same performance on DVD and find that the singers sounded like they were in their bathroom singing. I'm a diehard fan of Queensryche and Dio so they can do no wrong. I'm sure that the experience of the show was epic but the DVD left me wishing I was there.
__label__2	Get this and Livecrime: To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. If you can find the one with the booklet, even better. Watch the first part on the Livecrime DVD and the 2nd part on this DVD. The original Mindcrime with the original lineup cannot be topped. For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part. Who expects it to be?
__label__2	"Thoroughly enjoyable!: What a hoot! I've been a fan of these guys from the beginning, through thick and thin, and this set captures a truly remarkable performance. My only complain is that the audio quality seems to take a dump in the end of disc two. Geoff and Pamela sound way overmodulated, and the weird blurry effect that distorts the image of the two is distracting.The best parts? ""Suite Sister Mary"" from OMCI and ""Fear City Slide"" from OMCII.Awesome stuff!"
__label__2	"Il grande ritorno!: E' dai tempi del tour di ""empire"" che non vedevo i queensryche così in gran forma, questo dvd per me è il migliore di tutta la loro carriera, e la consacrazione di una band, dopo questo dvd si può tranquillamente dire che i queenssryche sono entrati nella storia del grande rock come i Deep purple, led zeppelin e thin lizzy negli anni settanta.I queensryche sempre si sono distinti dagli altri gruppi del loro genere, Geoff Tate è uno dei più importanti vocalists di tutti i tempi.Questo dvd è musica e teatro, la collaborazione più stretta con Pamela Moore rende questo dvd imperdibile.Una sola nota negativa, purtroppo nella composizione della seconda parte si sente l'assenza di Chris De Garmo,Mike Stone è un grande chitarrista, ma Chris De Garmo per me era fondamentale per la band, hanno perso la parte più melodoca, che era a mio parere molto importante in questo gruppo!"
__label__2	SOON,SOON,SOON,.................: Names Marcus from Sydney,Australia.I saw Queensryche when they came 'down under'and toured in July.They were totally AWESOME live,ans so I have been following there progress on the QR website.I can now hardly wait until I can get a copy of Queensrche: Mindcrime at the Moore.I met the guys after and they were fantastic to meet,along with Pamela Moore who reprised her roll as Sister Mary.A fantastic voice in Mind crime as well as a solo artist.I hope that one day they can come back 'DOWN' with this great act.This has to be a must for any 'QR' fan........................
__label__1	Queensryche & Seattle Suck: This performance is pure garbage. Unfortunately I was at this pathetic show. The audience was mostly old geezers who were there to watch a group of other geriatric has-beens. The sound was awful, their performance of West Side Story was ridiculous, and their hatred for America was sad. Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough. It was bad enough that they would embarrass themselves by performing in front of people, but they actually recorded their disaster. Now they think they can sell this crap??
__label__2	One of the best!: Some people call it cheap and flimsy. But I call it thin and delicate. and that's how it should be when you're opening a wine bottle. It is extremely easy to pop out the cork with this corkscrew. It also works with synthetic corks. No extra strength required at all. Believe me you'll be amazed after using this product. It comes with a nice container, which is a bonus.
__label__1	Poor quality and construction: This corkscrew is poorly made, consisting of low-grade stampings and flimsy plastic molded parts assembled with tinned rivets. It feels like it's going to come apart in your hand, and it requires considerable care to use it safely and effectively. It's outrageously overpriced, too. An unfortunate product offering from the company that brought us the legendary original Screwpull, perhaps the handiest corkscrew ever.I did manage to pull a cork with it, though - which is why it gets even two stars.
__label__1	Cheap corkscrew: It's awful. I bought it because I wanted a red corkscrew. However, the description does not state how cheaply it is made. Each time I use it I'm afraid it's going to break when I turn it. It's plastic. DO NOT BUY!
__label__2	Great to use BEFORE P90X: If you are not in really good shape this is a great product to get ready for P90X. It does get kind of boring because you are doing the same workouts every other day, but they do work. It is only about 30 mins but it is amazing how well it works.
__label__1	does not work: I purchased this product and the DVD's don't even work. I can't even use them. I get nothing,no picture,nothing.
__label__1	not worth it: it surprisingly contained very little substance. just 1 half hour workout per disk. got boring fast too. i found better stuff free on the internet.
__label__1	Soso: Where i enjoy the workout and feel it working i am upset that o ordersd from this site. The product said two dvds and and bonus, i only received the workout for week 3-4 and bonus mot work out wks 1-2!! Very upset!!!
__label__2	La reencarnación vista por un científico: El primer libro del Dr. Weiss sigue siendo un gran libro para todos aquellos a quienes les inquieta el tema de la reencarnación, así no crean en ella.
__label__2	Excelente Libro / Amazing book!!: Este libro ha sido uno de los mejores libros que he leido, soy adicta a la lectura y este libro me ayudo en muchas formas. Te ensena a analizar muchas cosas, a comprender otras con respecto a la vida y te lleva a tener una mente mas abierta cuando por ejemplo te pone a dudar si hay mas vidas ya que en algunas religiones eso es inconcebible.This book is one of the best books I have ever read, It makes you think and wonder about past life especially if you do not believe in that. I truly recommend this book.
__label__2	Magnifico libro: Brian Weiss ha dejado una magnifica guia para quienes no tienen mucha informacion acerca del Hipnotismo, La historia de Katerine es tan impresionante que podria ayudar a culquier persona que se ha hecho la pregunta mas de una vez sobre la continuidad de la vida.
__label__1	"Very disappointing: I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online ""return"" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon's service earned the second extra star."
__label__1	Not what I expected: I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive
__label__2	A Must Read: This is an interesting book that immediately caught my attention. From the first poem and throughout, each verse tells a story that seems to involve the reader at a very deep emotional level. There are some unique descriptions about the way a whole range of emotions are experienced through love. A different book, and good company on a quiet evening. Add it to your personal library.
__label__1	Bad band: The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product.
__label__1	Wouldn't stay up: The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product.
__label__1	Junk: This film tried to capitalized on the previously successful Legend of Boggy Creek, and failed horribly. It's nothing but a boring home movie. Other than a shot of someone prancing around a forest in a gorilla suit, the film has no perks whatsoever. Strongly not recommended.
__label__1	My thoughts on a terrible book: This book is about colonel Knox a leader of a freshly starting revolution in America. His mission is to carry around 200 cannons from Ticonderoga back to a city where British forces are docked. The main characters of this book are will Knox 19 year old brother of the colonel, colonel Knox in charge of expedition, J.P. a farmers son .I disliked this book. It drags on and never seems to end. Just when you think your going to get a fight there isn't one .the biggest problem they had on the trip was a river with too thin ice. What's so interesting about that? If I were you I would not buy this book. It is extremely boring.From a reader of this book
__label__1	The Worst Ever!!!!!!!!!: I thought this book was the worst book ever. It was so boring! Did I mention that it was the WORST BOOK EVER!!!! It was the worst book in the history of bad books. You should never read it. Take my word on that. Oh, and I didn't just choose to read it on my own. A teacher forced me to read the dumb novel. IT'S THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!
__label__2	A good book and a quick read: In this historical fiction book the story is told of how the colonists were able to keep the war going in the face of the British blockade of Boston harbor. The year was 1775, the Revolutionary War was in its early stages, and the colonists were out of ammunition enough to not overthrow the British out of their city. With Boston Harbor blockaded, the colonists could not gain any ammunition, so colonist Henry Knox hears of Fort Ticonderoga stocked with ammunition and devises a plan with his brother Will to bring the guns back to General Washington in the middle of winter. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a historical war book.
__label__2	Adventure: This was one of my favorite books assigned in school this year. I like the exciting adventures of this cannon trek from Fort Ticonderoga to Cambridge, MA. I liked how they crossed the ice with all of those big guns. When the last gun crossed, the ice cracked, but they were able to get the big gun out.
__label__1	Did not fit 2004 Kia Optima LX: I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch.
__label__2	"See The Whole Instead Of Just Its Parts: This book really resonates with my philosophy that we can all accomplish a lot more by coordinating, communicating, sharing, and preparing together. Mr. de Geus frees each of us to be fully human, and to humanize the organizations we are part of. He successfully challenges the limits of the mechanical view of human interactions, and provides a great vision into what is possible. A good complement for this book is ""The 2,000 Percent Solution"" -- a book that shows each of us how to tap into our innate talents to create world-class solutions through asking and answering a better set of questions. I also recommend ""The Pursuit of Prime."" With these three books, you can accomplish anything!"
__label__1	As low quality as you can get: Literally broke the first time I used them. I bought two, thinking that they were cheap and probably more prone to breaking. But I certainly didn't expect each of them to fail after ONE use. Pathetic. Don't waste your time and money on these incredibly low-quality items.
__label__2	"Awsome reading--I saw my own ""economic"" company described! .: Really hits home with a clear explanation on why companies fail. I was taken by the accuracy of what happens to companies living the economic model, after they go through a downsizing. His core premise of the company being a collection of human communities is right on. It is the first work which I have read that ""humanizes"" the corporate entity by calling it what it really is. A look at corporations beyond the bean-counter would be an appropriate sub-title for this work."
__label__2	creative, interesting approach to Greece: I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star.
__label__2	Greek Time Travel: This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!
__label__2	Rediscovering Greece and its people: While reading the book I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. In this journey, I explored the different sides of Greeks and how even today their strong sense of self emerges in their daily lives. The book creates a bridge between the past and the present revealing that Ulysses journey to come back home represents our own desire to attain fulfillment.
__label__1	why i think the book is going to be great: I think this book is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court.This is the perfect book to start with.
__label__2	A well liked gift: I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it.
__label__1	Horrible Quality: This isn't really a massager, it doesn't vibrate or sooth muscles. It is really more of a flashlight with a dinky infrared bulb in it that isn't powerful enough to do any good anyways. Save your money, folks. This one is a complete dud.
__label__1	heat therapy: I used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed. To get good results I guess you would have to use it in a specific area for a good length of time, otherwise not much good.
__label__1	Infrared MASSAGER: Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Don't waste your money. It's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared. Doesn't heat up to any degree that will be helpful. Still waiting to hear back from the supplier (two weeks now) to return this item. Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $10.... Enough said
__label__2	Infrared Massager and Heating Device: I received the product in a timely manner. It was as advertised. I have used it a number of times and it works well although I haven't gotten the results from it I had hoped for. No fault of the seller or the product though.
__label__1	Feels great until it melts and then explodes.: I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it.
__label__2	"I LOVE this CD!: My favorite of all her CD's. What a wonderful voice. LOVE her Billie Holiday covers, but mostly love ""Hey John,"" which i understand is to be about John Lennon. Buy this CD, i doubt you will regret it!"
__label__2	Great for beginers like me.: I got this book because I was writing a research paper on palmistry. Out of the five books and two web sites I used as sources, this one was the most informative. Some of the books were witten as if they were trying to confuse the reader. This one had interseting anecdotes and asy to follow illustrations and discriptions.
__label__1	"Halica Bliss Out v.11...: ...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, ""Fish"", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling (""didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?"") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures."
__label__2	EXCELLENT: Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug.Whether he wanted to make money or just expand his horizons, it really doesn't matter.He formed this band, Harlem River Drive, in 1970, and made one hell of an album. Truth be told, this project does not have much to do with the Latin Jazz Eddie is known for. Harlem River Drive is an out and out soul funk album: wha whas, grooving percussion, all the ingredients you would expect from a crack unit during the era.And more: with a baritone sax--an extremely underused instrument in all genres--in front, this album has a uniquely jazzy flavor, even though the beats could be off a Santana or War or Mandrel album.As funk, it works full bore, but the novel textures here make an already fantastic funk project so much more.
__label__2	Simply one of the greatest albums ever recorded !: Harlem River Drive holds a very deep place inside my heart and I'm glad to see its still alive and well and others out there appreciate this very special music.
__label__2	Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II: Excellent and well-written book. Recommended reading for young adults and older. We must all remember what atrocities were committed in Europe and other countries. It is a testament to the human spirit and the capacity to survive terrible circumstances. This book will become a permanent part of our family's library.
__label__2	Ignored master: It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne. His songs have thankfully lived on in other artists' recordings, but his own versions are more than worth hearing and on occasion, revelatory. If you are interested in the music part of country music you will care about Leon Payne.
__label__2	Sexy and Different: I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly. Great service! The look is fun and sexy -- these are cut REALLY low. They will probably reveal a bit of butt cleavage, but my girlfriend and I really like the different look and feel of these quality panties. I knocked off one star because they run a bit small; order a size up if in doubt.
__label__2	Excellent singles whatever ones you choose: There are basically 3 singles out there to ownwhite cover UK single 1 (stellar is not actually acoustic like on the drive single)1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Stellar (Acoustic)Are you in (video)red cover UK single 21. Are you in2. Wish you were here (live)pardon me (live video)australian release1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Wish you were here (live)4. Warning (live)5. Stellar (live)Overall if you just want the tracks, get the aussie single, if you need the videos as well then get the 2 UK cds.as far as tracks go, all of them are very good, the live versions, especially warning are excellent quality. The remix of are you in is surprisingly awesome to the point you would think thats the way the song is meant to sound if hearing it the first time.Hope that is of help
__label__1	"THIS COLLECTION IS INCOMPLETE: THE STIFFS WERE A GOOD SOFT BAND.THIS CD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST WORK. BUT MISSING IS HERE ARE THE SONGS 'D.C.RIP' AND ANOTHER GREAT TRACK FROM THAT 7"". FOR CAPTAIN OI!TO LEAVE OUT SUCH AWESOME WORK IS DISTURBING. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RELEASE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TITLED""THE STIFFS_LOVE SONGS COLLECTION"". THE BAND ITSELF RATES BETTER THAN 2 STARS, BUT NOT HAVING THE SONGS IT SHOULD OF HAD,GREATLY DEPRECIATES THIS CD."
__label__1	The Stench: I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it.The cheap cologne smell is inescapable. Wash your face with this stuff and you'll be smelling it all day.I popped the top and smelled it at the store, but after using it the smell is much stronger.
__label__1	Avoid this product.: A man should not smell like an entire bottle of cologne when he gets out of the shower, nor should the entire house he lives in smell like a giant vat of cologne. Go buy a bottle of nondescript body wash and after your shower apply a few squirts of the cologne of your choice. But really, why would you need cologne if you're just going to the office?! You don't! Please make it stop!
__label__1	Monkeys Paw: How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here later
__label__1	Incomplete Edition: The hard cover reprint edition offered by Amazon and others is incomplete. It contains Part 1 only. Note the page count (208) and compare it to the trade paperback versions (310-324 page count).Avoid this edition.
__label__1	Blurred Audio: Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados.
__label__2	Great Easy Listening Tunes: This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work.
__label__2	"What Campbell/Webb Fans Have Been Waiting For: Finally, the long awaited CD that all of us Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb fans have been waiting for! This CD includes Glen's best album from the 70s, ""Reunion"", along with virturally all of his covers of Webb's later songs. A must have CD!"
__label__2	A 1970s gem: As other reviewers have righly asked, how was this not a big seller upon its release? So many good songs, sung so well. I never tire of listening to this one.
__label__2	"Quick, Buy This One!: As of this writing, this great CD was on ""limited availability"". This is a CD that I can't get out of my head and break into song while listening to it. It's very moving and melodious. Yes, I love Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell but may not have bought it if I didn't read the reviews. The reviews were so upbeat that I bought the album and have it playing as I write. Please note that there is another CD called Glen Campbell ""Reunion"". Don't get that one. Get this one. The cover looks the same but this one has 24 songs on it rather than the normal number. Rated it 5 stars - you'll sing along too."
__label__2	Superb collection of mostly overlooked gems: This disc proves that there's much more to the Campbell/Webb association than the 4 or 5 hits from the late 60s we all know and love. 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress', 'Highwayman', 'Lightning in a Bottle' and 'If These Walls Could Speak' are particularly fine Webb songs and they're given superb renditions by Campbell. The chemistry has always been right between these two and I hope it's not the last we hear of them together.
__label__2	"An inexpensive time machine: Words have been crafted in previous reviews which dwarf my abilities yet I must include the following information: ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress"" is one song which justifies the price of admission. No other singer has ever approached Glen's interpretation of this haunting tune. The song was included on Capitol's ""The Very Best of Glen Campbell"" Lp when originally released but was sadly missing when the album went to cd. Raven has given us the opportunity to hear not only the entire original album but has included a number of stunning bonus cuts as well. This cd is a treasure for all Glen Campbell-Jimmy Webb fans. Campbell's voice is as clear and plaintiff as ever and no words can describe Webb's genious. Listen for yourself. Hats off to Raven!"
__label__1	Definitely not a must have: Nice pictures, but no descriptions and the map on the book doesn't even mention Merritt IslandBuy a proper birdbook rather than this overpriced pamphlet
__label__2	Florida birds: I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!
__label__2	Great product: I am so happy with this product. My drawers stay neat, clean and most umpotantly organized - I can find everything quickly.
__label__2	Plain and Simple: A women's journey to the Amish: This book arrived in a short amount of time and was in very good condition
__label__1	There is no insight to be gained after finishing this book.: It is absolutely unbelievable this woman IS a therapist, by reading her book, she NEEDS one. She relates to clay more than to children or people. Whatever she was looking for in an Amish community, she never found it and translates that to the reader. Don't waste your time with this very poor read.
__label__1	"Author is WAY too self-absorbed: I wanted to read this book because the simple life of the Amish people intrigued me.I wish this lady would have talked more about the Amish.Instead,all you read about is ""Me,me,me"".""What am I doing in my life?""Why do I do this/that?"" blah blah blah.By the end of the book the reader really doesn't care anymore!It was scarey for me to find out that this woman is a therapist-YIKES!The reason I gave it 2 stars is that (1) When she does talk about the Amish it is interesting (2) It is a short book and a quick read."
__label__1	Really horrible book: This book is a self-centered piece of random musings. It is not about the Amish. It is about the author, and frankly, she's not someone I would really care to meet and discuss important issues with. She spends SO much time on HER thoughts, HER ideas, that one forgets this is supposed to be a book about the Amish way of life. This is not a journey TO the Amish. It is a boring, breathtakingly conceited journey into the author's confused mind. I suggest counseling for her. Her book just plain stinks.
__label__1	I was very disappointed in this book: I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego.
__label__1	She did not get the point.: I thought this book was a sad commentary on the lostness of the author. Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book.
__label__1	Just Okay: This book is 'just okay.' I came away from reading the book not knowing too much about the Amish. Sue prefers to keep most of the information to herself. She does, however, make sure she gets in adequate writing about all of her 'accomplishments' -- and makes apparent her desire to return to her old life of those accomplishments. (Big hairy deal!) Personally I think she's a bore....and a boor; actually I found her to be pompous. She had a wonderful idea which could have been made better. Sue Bender, you need to grow up.
__label__2	Everyone should read this book.: I first heard Sue Bender on NPR talking about her Amish experience...I was enthralled with it. Later I found the book and read it start to finish in one sitting. As I read it I kept thinking I wanted to buy a copy for all my friends.
__label__1	"Disgrace of a book for anyone who studies the Amish writings: 2 stars is pretty generous, in my opinion. This book seemed more like a book about the process she went through writing a book about visiting Amish families. I found myself wondering where I might be able to find the book she spent so much time ""pouring her soul into"". The book is largely spent talking about how incredible she is for having completed such a daunting task and is filled with many backhanded remarks regarding Amish communities. She comes off pompous and self-indulgent, not at all like the humbled, pious woman she paints herself out to be. Would recommend skipping this book."
__label__2	"Must read for anyone in a ""pressure cooker"" job: This is a very uplifting trip taken and proves that fancy, 'doodads' in our lives are really totally unnecessary for real to-the-bone happiness and sense of worth."
__label__1	PLEASE: You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY.The Amish are the most backwards group of misfits I have ever encountered.Where kids beat on when you were they? Were wives talked down to and belitted? Were animals beat and starved? I thought not. Maybe you should take another trip...and tell it like it really is. I do not think much of your book. It is NOT TRUE
__label__2	A lovely Little Book on the the Importance of Simplicity in Life: This is a lovely little book. It is filled with contemplations on the importance of simplicity and balance in one's life.A busy woman who has focused her life on success becomes enamored of Amish quilts. Her admiration is so great that she takes time out from her life to go and live with the Amish. There, she reflects on her own values and comes to realize that the act of doing is as important as the outcome. She also realizes that being a part of something, rather than standing out from others, is a more cooperative and giving way to live.How the author juxtaposes the meaning of things with the sentiment reflected in the quilts is very lovely and meaningful.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever had questions about what is important in life and their own core values.
__label__2	Beautifully written and insightful perspective.: I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a lovely story and written very well. It let's us know that everyone is human and in all communities there are good things and not so good things. Take the good and leave the rest. I have drawn on some of Sue Bender's experiences with the Amish and applied them in my own life. How wonderful to be able to read about someone else's experience and feel like you are there by their side.
__label__2	This book balances the slavishly pro-Israel tomes: A well-written book, and well documented. No matter what your view of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this book balances against the 99% of books that take a pro-Israel slant. I especially appreciated Khouri's calm, objective manner of discussing the issues.Is this book outdated? Heck no! What I think is interesting is that history basically never changes in the Middle East. This book is essential for any scholar of the area.
__label__1	The book presents history from a pro-arab stance.: The book presents a historical and political account of the middle east from 1922-1984. The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East.
__label__1	"Hard to fill, leaks, and handles break: We were given this product as a gift and absolutely loved them at first. They are compact (compared to many grinders) and a cute design. Unfortunately we found the first flaw a few weeks later when it came time to refill for the first time. The refill doors are tiny! The only reasonable way to pour in salt was to use a paper funnel and the pepper was even worse having to be fed one peppercorn at a time through the tiny door.After the second refill the little doors started refusing to stay shut. Since they slide ""up"" to close with the way the mills sit on the shelf. They just fall down and constantly reopen with the help of gravity even when not used.We used these mills at most for 3 meals a week...2 people who aren't heavy spicers, but despite our limited use of these mills the handles broke off in under 11 months.It's a cute product if you are ok with something that is designed to not be used beyond 2-3 refills."
__label__1	Handle broke within a week: I picked these up locally to use at the table. Only used few times when a handle on the salt mill broke right off. They worked OK before breaking, but didn't have much output. They also appeared to be difficult to refill, the opening is only about 3/8 of an inch square.
__label__1	a real pain: I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. I use it daily. The grinding mechanism is already tired. Now it takes a lot of patience to actually get the desired amount of pepper/salt and it's getting on my nerves. So I'm browsing amazon for a real and efficient mill set.To be fair there is one thing I like in this product: the magnets that let you stick them to the cooker hood.
__label__1	Don't waste your mony: Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.
__label__1	really cute magnets but...: horrible set of grinders. these handles broke before i had the chance to refill them! waste of money.
__label__1	Poor durability and hard to fill: Never satisfied with traditional mills, I bought these because they had a unique design. I liked that they stick to the fridge but have found that means I occasionally have to wipe off pepper flakes. The small, rectangular holes make funneling refills difficult and messy. About a month into light use, the pepper mill gummed up and cleaning was a real chore. After about a year of moderate use, the pepper mill just wasn't grinding properly anymore. Cute but not very durable.
__label__1	waste of money: hard to squeeze, hard to fill, hard to get more than a pinch of spice. there is a miniature hole to get salt and peppercorns in the units, they spill everywhere and don't hold much so you're always filling them. The handles are small and hard to hold. You have to squeeze them at least 30 times to get a decent amount of spice out.
__label__2	Very nice and handy to store: I got these as a gift and really do like them. I just stick them to the fridge (magnets) and always know where they are. They are easy to use altho I do find they release less salt or pepper than you first think....so you have to squeeze more times than you normally would. It takes some getting used to.This is very handy to have, easy to use and its nice to have a small set to pass around at the table. I am also glad you can graind the salt...some sets are for grinding pepper but not the salt.
__label__1	Not for the serious minded..: Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder.
__label__1	"Broken in less than 1 month: I purchased this pepper grinder at a kitchen outlet store. One of the ""rabbit ear"" handles snapped at the base after less than 1 month of use. I don't reccomend this product."
__label__1	cute but don't: Looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge, but they're just eye candy. Shakers don't store a lot of salt or pepper. Handles are too small to comfortably hold, and it's hard to detect any salt and pepper coming out.
__label__1	review mni magnetic s& p set: Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well. It takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount. Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough? Very disappointed in product.
__label__1	Is cheap and thats it: Is cheap and does its jobBut the handle feel cheap and seems like is about to break.Sometime the peper chop a big chunk off
__label__1	Not Higgin's best but a fair read: Lucky Luciano helping to put an end to the invasion of Sicily --- I think not. The story line was a little too hard to believe. Don't mix up gangsters with your stories of war and espionage. Stick to your Dillon and Ferguson characters. They're the ones that we like to read Mr. Higgins.
__label__1	Unfulfilled potential: As light weight sci-fi/horror anthologies go this is probably good value for money (given its low price), but the apparent lack of good editing and of proper proof reading is painfully evident and you definitely won't find any candidate for a Hugo or Nebula award.You'll find a couple of interesting ideas, a lot of trite and derivative ones and occasionally some baffling lack of coherent character development.There's enough to show that Messrs. Jason Brannon, Eric S. Brown and John Grover have the potential to write something good, but it seems to be, at the moment at least, unfulfilled potential.
__label__1	This is high school creative writing...: I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class.
__label__1	"Substitute the name ""Burmese"" for any cat: Although books about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I'm afraid this book gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth. Let's all write one!"
__label__1	Other than the History of the breed, not specific to a Burmese Cat at all!: I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing.
__label__2	Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat: Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition: This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding.
__label__2	Comprehensive Introduction: Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts.
__label__2	Very informative, good read.: I purchased this book for a class, rather than for enjoyment. That said, I found the book to be very informative and relatively easy to read. Of the two textbooks that I purchased, I most definitely prefer this one.
__label__2	Still great, but...: This is my sixth edition, and this book is still a great way to get ready for the season.But the writing has taken a distinct turn toward the serious. The essays and player profiles are still chock full of relevant numbers and piercingly well-considered arguments, but this year they are also somewhat...I really don't want to say it...tedious.What was once a light-hearted romp through some serious baseball thinking is now rather dense and dry. I'll buy again next year, but I hope somebody sends them a keg of Lighten-Up.+
__label__1	Bill James it ain't: No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's.
__label__1	"Not a fan: Nothing here that you can't glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. Anyone can run numbers and models, and really that's all you get.The ""writing"" (purposeful quotes) is painful.Buying this book is no different than putting a match to your money."
__label__2	I spy: These books are the best. My kids all under 5 love them. They are so easy to understand that you don't need to be there to explain or read what they are looking for it shoes the picture for them. I'm defiantly going to buy more.
__label__2	I SPY for younger children: Shipping was fast and packaging great. I was slightly disappointed that this seemed like an I Spy book for a much younger child than my 8 (almost 9 year old son)..... I wish I had known that ahead of time. Still, a great beginner I spy book, well put together and nice sturdy cover. Thank you.
__label__2	Short and concise: Concise look at Napoleon and his exploits. This essay is best used as an introduction to be followed up by Schom, Asprey and Horne.
__label__1	A Military History: This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here.
__label__1	An Unclear Biography of Napoleon: Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon.
__label__2	Orange Mound Representer: Chopper Girl's debut album on HooDoo Labs is a throwback to an older often times forgotten subgenre of Memphis rap.The album has dark overtones and rides a fine line between Horrorcore and Gangsta Rap. Touching on a variety of subjects Chopper Girl seems to show she isn't a one trick pony and this album has selections ranging from a high octane posse cut to dark and sinister tracks that are heavily influenced by vodou and all the way back to selections that will easily get people moving in the clubs and c-walking on the streets. A veritable whose who of Memphis artists make guest appearances both vocally and on the production side of the house. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Memphis underground.
__label__2	"Very good album: This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
__label__1	G.A.R.B.A.G.E...believe dat!: This is one of the worst Cd's I've ever heard. This chick is garbage and so's this cd. Don't waste your money on this one. Chopper Girl...haha....more like wack as hell girl. I didn't even wanna give you one star but I had to.
__label__2	"Worth it for the Furs cover alone.: Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow '80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. ""The Ghost in You"" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn't have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler's limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
__label__1	shallow and unmoving: The book was badly observed and shallow, with predictable and cliched plots. It made me want to throw up mostofthe time, and offered very little insight into the characters feelings. Do not read it unless you have to.
__label__2	Jeep clutch slave cylinder: Answer the same as the Master cylinder. Nothing available from Jeep. Seems to perform as expected. Delighted as the only other answer would have been to change complete clutch setup including bell housing.
__label__2	last word of saints and sinners: Haven't read all of it, but it is pretty interesting so far. Don't spend more than 5 bucks.
__label__1	There are not very many books I hate. This is one of them.: I find this books to be incredibly disrespectful of it's own contents. The information is at best laughable and at worst horrifyingly stupid.Others have mentioned the concept of the 'new' triple Deities(as everyone knows that you can create deities just by reading about them in a book and wanting them to exist *real* hard). I also found the concept that these deities would be thrilled with offerings of trash and garbage particularly 'interesting'(by which I mean nonsensical and silly.)This book is garbage of the lowest common denominator. A sheer money grab by a person who lives in a self created commune in a rural area. If I could chose one book to permanently remove from all bookstores and shelves this would be seriously in the running for that spot. Dare I say it - worse then SWR if only because everyone knows she writes garbage whereas people, for some reason, think this is the best stuff ever.
__label__2	"Urban Primitive Spiritualism: This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."
__label__2	Fantastic: Lurpak is far better than any other butter out there. Be glad you can buy it in the USA! Creamy, tasty and just plain good.
__label__2	Great singers some not associated with Mozart. Good sound: I recall this recording on LP in the early fifties. It conveys the humour and genius of Mozart with great singers although other than Steber they were not previously identified with WM.
__label__1	broken: I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
__label__1	Didn't do much: Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick. The vibrations weren't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off. I didn't get any benefit from it and I don't think he got much.
__label__1	Don't Waste Your Money: First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. Secondly, we've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring. We've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh. It's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all. Once it was on it really didn't do what it is supposed to do - it's more awkward than anything. Definitely would not recommend.
__label__1	You get what you pay for!!!: I was amazed to find out that this cable was so cheap and would work with my 1080p tv. Much to my surprise, the cable didn't respond too well to my tv and left me with black screens every so often. When I did my reasearch, I realized that not all HDMI cables are the same! If the cable is anywhere from $1 to $40, chances are it won't work well and isn't HDMI-Certified.Doesn't seem strange to only have to spend $1 on a High Definition cable when your tv and sound system probably cost around 3 grand?THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HDMI CABLES! NEVER BUY A CABLE UNLESS IT HAS BANDWITH, SPEED, COLOR, SOUND, AND FREQUENCY RATINGS ON IT! Also remember, the longer the cable the less data makes it out of the other side!Watch videos on Monstercable.com to learn more about which cable is best for you and you tv.
__label__2	103 Great Poems Meistergedichte Johann Wolfgang von GOethe: Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German.
__label__2	One of my all-time favorites: If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time.
__label__2	Amazing Amazon Doctor: We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shot,MRI, special night boot, creams to rub on his foot, etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction.
__label__2	Wonderful read and true to the experience: During travels to the Explorama Lodges twice, I was able to see what Dr. Smith has been able to accomplish. She is a marvelously dedicated individual. This books is a diary of her experiences, but after having visited the area, I was also able to have similar experiences from a tourist perspective. Dr. Smith, who I have met and talked to is a creative, stong and full person, dedicated to make a difference for the people in this area of the Amazon. She has done that and the book tells her story.

__label__2	winter's tale: After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read.
__label__1	Not like I remember it: I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?
__label__1	"Four Star Music - get the other edition though: Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
__label__1	Not what I was anticipating: Thought it was a picture book of the Fiords.... That's what happens sometimes when you cannot actually touch a book...
__label__2	Unique and Captivating China: High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well.
__label__2	nice print: a bit small then i would like but it was nice. Got it for my son's History class and it worked out great
__label__1	Does not work: According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices.
__label__1	CRAP: I don't know what happened to Natalise between her first album and this one. She was so sweet on the first one and the music was good. Now she comes off like a wannabe tough girl swearing all over this record. There really did not need to be all of that. The music wasn't even hot. I'm sorry that I paid good money for this album. Buyer beware!!!
__label__2	"I'm soooooooo impressed: A friend of mine has Natalise's first album and I thought it was pretty good. But I was not prepared when I bought her new album. OMG this album is SO AMAZING! It is much better than my wildest expectations! We don't have any big record stores in my little town, so I had to order it and it and I forgot about it. Then when it came I was like, ""okay, let's see what it sounds like becaue the clips on her website where pretty good"". But EVERY song on this album is AMAZING! I love the slow songs, and she printed all the lyrics. The fast dance songs sound REALLY good in the car with the volume cranked all the way up! This is just all-around an absolutely stellar album. Natalise did an incredible job on it. I would not be suprised to see her win a Grammy one day!"
__label__2	melancholic and upbeat: This is one of my favorite Guy Clark efforts. I love the marvellous mixture of the melancholic and the upbeat. Some highlights for me are the elegaic wistfulness of songs like Fort Worth Blues and Forever, for Always, for Certain. These lovely songs are nicely balanced by the energy displayed in such tunes as Sis Draper or Die Tryin'.For me Guy Clark belong to that select band of singer/songwriters which include such luminaries as John Prine and Kris Kristofferson
__label__2	Simply Wonderful: Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!
__label__2	cold dog soup: guy clark cold dog soup is a good CD to listen to just discoverd guy clark some i'm trying more of his music
__label__2	The best keeps on getting better and better.: Dylan? Jagger and Richards? Lennon and McCarthy? For my money the best songwriter ever is Guy Clark. His latest effort does not dissapoint. It is a social injustice that Guy Clark isn't a megastar. Nashville needs to wake up and recognize the talent that they have and not the hacks they continue to play on the radio. The Shawn Camp song is awesome. Shawn Camp is the best kept secret in the world. Here's hoping he does another album someday.
__label__2	Is there a bad Guy Clark CD?: Of course not. And this is another great one. Just stop putzing around and buy it.
__label__1	A little too Lite: Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. I found only the light construction part. While they seem durable enough, the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet. It's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons, but just not substantial enough for me.
__label__1	"Manufacturing error: On the one hand, I loved the book, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. However, my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of ""The Age of Reason"". When they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books, they should remove this review. At that point, I will eagerly buy a new copy."
__label__2	Its Paine, enough said: All works are untampered with and represents truth based reading as to the authenticity. Nice bound book to boot as with elder tradition.
__label__2	five stars for deism!: Thomas Paine strikes a (still) powerful blow for Jeffersonian values and deism. In my mind, definitely a classic.
__label__2	What a useful collection.: It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country.
__label__1	"Does he even have an editor?: I have no background in history and do not pretend to know what I'm talking about in that regard. However, when it comes to grammar, I know what I'm doing - and Howard Zinn, apparently, does not. The chapter of this book that I was given (Chapter 8: On Presidential Liars) was the most horrendously written piece of work I've ever read. Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to Mr. Zinn, the American people have been ""deceived about"" much more than we thought, and should all ""deep anguish"" over it."
__label__1	Taylor Made Gazebo: When trying to install the products attachment brackets to the boat railing three of the eight screws supplied sheared off. When attempting to attach the cover over the frame, I discovered one of the velcro pieces sewn into the cover was coming unraveled. The center support pole that installs across the top and runs from front to back is supposed to have a pocket for the pole to fit into sewn into the cover at each end; mine only had one pocket making the center support useless. Got in touch with Taylor Made customer service to resolve the issue. They arranged for pick up of the defective product and said a new one would be sent right out to replace it....... over three weeks later and I still haven't received it. I think it will serve its purpose once I ever get the darn thing and it's not defective !
__label__1	Not his best effort: Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. I read to be drawn into a story and it did not happen.
__label__1	Brain numbing: Strange analogy on death. I tried to go find good in this rambling read but non exist. No need to bother.
__label__1	Did not like at all.: I Just did not like the story line.Ii was not able to get into the story. Didn't even finish the book.
__label__2	"IMMORTAL!!...: Immortal is so good. I bought this album today, and this is after my opinion a little better than ""Battles in the north"". I've actually just have ""Sons of norhern darkness"", ""Battles In the north"", and ""At the heart of winter"", but i'm getting Diaboilical and Pure Holocaust this christmas.... I think SOND is the best immortal cd i have right now, but if u like to get chills and get cold over u'r body, this is the cd for you!!!"
__label__2	"truly epic: many people give 5 stars in a rather nonchalant manner completly nulling the value of the prestigious 5. This cd is the most essential black metal album I've ever come across. I do not sheepishly just ""give"" the five star rating, I stand by my rating proudly for all to see. THIS IS THE ONE! EPIC! also I do not listen to garbage black metal like most so you can trust my opinion. This album drives a sword through the pu@#y a!@ bellies of all other pu%$y a#@ bands. HAH HAH HAHp.s. kill nevermore"
__label__2	A music fan from Ca. U.S.A.: This album is truly a masterpiece. Immortal has goneback to their heavy-metal roots. The songs are long and not complex as their previousalbums were. Different direction, not as fast as their older albums, but stillunmistakable Immortal. I trulyrecommend this album.
__label__2	"Blackened Thrash and Extreme Cold: This is my second attempt at writing a review for ATHOW. I don't know what happened to the first one. But, I'm sure none of you really care!! HAHA. ATHOW is very close to being the best metal record I own. The guitar work by Abbath is bone-crushing, and the drumming by Horgh is phenominal. But, the real excellence is Peter Tagtgren's production. He brings to life what these musicians are conveying. Superb. Immortal have created an amazing metal ""fantasy"" with all their records. Brilliant. Immortal is now reforming and will open the Wacken Festival in Germany in 2007. Be there if you can, if not buy this and ""Sons of Northern Darkness."""
__label__1	BROKE IN A MILLION PIECES: I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. It broke into a million pieces on arrival. You could hear the delivery guy when he was walking to my door. VERY DISAPPOINTED because it was a gift. Returned it right away! Buyer beware!!
__label__1	Not packed well at all - arrived completely shattered!: I was very excited to receive this - but when it was delivered - it was a cake dome in a box - shattered into pieces because it was not wrapped inside the box at all! And I ordered it new! Would not purchase again - will go to the store to buy any sort of glass product.
__label__2	Great, but found it cheaper!: This is a great cake dome -- it's beautiful and the price isn't bad! But I actually found it a few days after I used it the first time at Target for $15. I couldn't believe Target was cheaper than Amazon -- that rarely happens! So check there first. Still, I think it was worth way more than that, so if you don't find it there, definitely order here on Amazon!
__label__2	good value: Packaged well and received in excellent condition. Looks as pictured, heavy weight glass, substantial size and attractive design. Very reasonable price as compared with many others. Very happy with purchase.
__label__2	Perfect gift for the family: Purchased iwth Amazon Prime, it got delivered in two days without any damage. Shape and size are perfect for my sister who is getting this for Xmas and to use during her house parties.
__label__1	False advertising: Received the correct box, which was damaged as noted in item description, however, the cake dome was not the item pictured and not the item in the product description. It was a very used dome from a different manufacturer and very different style (black and handpainted). Diasppointed as the savings for this particular item was significant when compared to a new one when I took the sellers word as in the product description aned photos.
__label__1	Beautiful but Misrepresented: The Cake dome set was beautiful. I needed a 14 inch diameter plate because I was making a 12 inch cake. The lid had an 11 inch diameter so would not fit the cake. I was disappointed because when I search Amazon for the 14 inch cake plate; there were many unrelated products choices. It was very frustrating. Amazon, please only give unasked for alternatives. I know I am going to google search my product choices to find websites that only give me what I want!
__label__2	Nicest possible domed cake stand!: I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. The dome is very solid to protect desserts but also fits nicely (and heavily) onto the base, keeping things fresh at room temperature. Highly recommended!
__label__2	Unnecessarily Dense but Useful: Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness.
__label__2	You can get as a podcast: This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this book, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes.
__label__2	important for my research at college: This book is very important for american descendants living in Brazil. We can't let the culture dies.
__label__1	Piece of junk: I bought this for my 8 year old son who is extremely interested in exploring the things around him. The Scope It Out was bought as a stocking stuffer at Christmas and as a companion to his in-house microscope. So he could take the Scope it Out outside and explore bugs, plants, dirt, etc.The Scope It Out was a failure. The directions say to adjust the focus by turning the rubber covered eyepiece - which does not do anything. Then to bring things closer or farther into view, just tip the Scope over. We experimented on various items, such as a fingernail, orange peel, bug, etc. It was a joke. I could do better with a magnifying glass. The optics were below poor.I would not recommend this for any one of any age. Don't waste your money.
__label__2	Science fun!: A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Scope easily focuses by tilting the scope rather than fiddling with adjustment knobs. It's so fun to see things really close up!
__label__2	Works perfectly but difficult to install: I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. The original board was permanently fastened to the opener chassis and had to be cut off. I then had to drill holes in the side of the opener and fasten the new board with two screws. Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs.
__label__1	Absolutely Awful: I find this book is in poor taste, notwithstanding the attempt to put a nice cover on it. Not authorship, but cut and paste out of the Bible. I did the same thing as a kid in CCD. But, make a book out of it? Ugh! An absolutely awful example of using the Bible to sell books. Don't support this kind of thing.
__label__1	Gross: Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!
__label__2	Dolly's Best Album: I have been a Dolly Parton fan for longer than I can remember. I listened to my cassette with Jolene until I wore it out. This is Dolly Parton's best album ever. Period. There is not a bad song on the record. Her soulful, plaintive ballads contrast with driving bluegrass melodies to create a complete album. There is no way to really explain how good this album is - you just have to experience it for yourself. If you are a fan of Dolly Parton or just bluegrass music in general, you need to buy this album.
__label__2	Dolly Parton - The Grass is Blue: This is a great CD, especially if you like Bluegrass music and Dolly Parton. What a fantastic combination!
__label__2	"A timeless masterpiece: I bought ""The Grass Is Blue"" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. They didn't lie. This is one of the finest things I have ever heard, from ANY musical genre. I played it for my wife, who has zero bluegrass background, and she was just swept away by it. Every cut is strong, but the odd-numbered tracks appeal to me most, with ""Steady As the Rain"" being a particular highlight. Be warned, ""The Grass Is Blue"" may permanently hijack your musical tastes. Now when I listen to blues and rock standards that used to appeal, I just can't sustain interest for more than a few minutes. Nothing compares to the power, the purity, the soul that Dolly Parton delivers. I am compelled to go back to ""The Grass Is Blue"" for another deep drought of that cool living water. This is one album I never want to live without."
__label__2	"Essential Dolly Parton: Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
__label__2	Essential Bluegrass!: Not only am I a fan of Dolly Parton, but a huge fan of bluegrass. Dolly has once again shown her versatility in delivering the essence of bluegrass, and adding so much more with her unique voice and harmonic orchestrations. This album is a buy whether you are a Bluegrass, Dolly Parton, or Folk listener.p.s. I'm still only halfway through my first listening of the album as I'm writing this!
__label__2	Magnificent Accomplishment: This is one of those beautiful moments. You know Dolly has been kicking around major labels like a tennis ball. You know that women singers past 40 rarely get airplay. You know Dolly is a wonderful singer whose creative potential has not lessened. You bring home her latest CD on the smaller North Carolina-based Sugar Hill label; and you wonder if her recording career will be reduced to small independent releases. Then you put on the disc. Wow! I like Dolly's philosophy: When all else fails, make one of the best albums of your career. This album is nearly flawless. The steller bluegrass players lend an integrity and enthusiasm which keeps taking Dolly even higher. The songs of spiritual faith are transcendent and not preachy. This is a magnificent accomplishment. If you've like Dolly or bluegrass music, don't miss this marriage of the two. Unforgettable!
__label__2	"yet another 5 star review...: I'm no great fan of bluegrass or country, but this release intrigued me because - like many people, I suspect - I have a soft spot for Dolly. ""The Grass is Blue"", though, really is as good as the other reviewers have said."
__label__1	"Slick, over-produced bluegrass: I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
__label__1	"Only for the ""Waltons"": I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
__label__2	The Grass is the Finest!: Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. Why she didn't sing and stretch like these years ago is beyond me, but she soars along with the hot group of musicians and singers with her. I have been playing this CD for months since I got it and I can't seem to get enough. I would have loved to see her tour with this ensemble of musicians with her, but I think she only played in Nashville last January.Here's to hoping she records more bluegrass, but until then I'll give The Grass is Blue another spin.
__label__2	"dolly can do no wrong: This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
__label__2	The best! * * * * * * * * * * 10 Stars!: Dolly Parton, you've done it again! Continue to give us your best. Your adoring fan, Sergio.
__label__2	Seek no further if you love melancholy music!: This is it. The best, most heartfelt debut I've heard in a long, long while. Lhasa sings of love, rejection, defiance, vanity, birds in the desert, the fish in the river, the tree of forgetfulness, all with a voice that is now sweet as desire, now wrenching as a lover's scorn. The music reminds me alternately of fado, klezmer, cabaret and Kurt Weill. And the girl is only 25. One can only wait with bated breath and hope it won't be too long before the second album appears. Meanwhile, I'll try not to wear out this CD!
__label__2	Just incredible!: How a young female singer from Quebec (with mexican parents I believe) could do a so powerful album! This album must be know around the world. You'll love this CD at the first second you listen to it... maybe 2 ou 3, but no more! The music is so good, it makes you sing or dance! Lhasa has only one album now, but she's working on an other actually. Don't miss it, don't pass beside this one, it would be a mistake.
__label__2	Amazingly Beautiful: I own over 800 CD's and this is my first review on line. This haunting performance showers you with romance and poetry; she holds your heart and reshapes it with lasting passion. Thank you Ms. De Sela
__label__2	"Probably The Best Canadian release in this decade!!!!: Less than a year ago I saw maybe a 30 sec. of one of her songs on MuchMusic, and I was...amased. I remembered her name, and soon I saw her perform live in Toronto on two occasions. MAGIC!!! I picked up a copy of her CD, and it's one of my favourite albums EVER. Beautiful!!! I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists, being one myself, and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you ""Buy This"" because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you ""Buy this"" because I like it and so will you, and anyone else you play it to. And if you ever have a chance to see her perform live, DO IT. It was the most intimate performance I ever saw artist deliver on stage. And her band shines with her."
__label__1	"Too much noise for nothing?: Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
__label__1	Not better than Chavela Vargas but certainly prettier: After all these reviews, it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice ... yet, I think that those who claim to like Lhasa would much prefer the originality and talent of Chavela Vargas. Indeed, Lhasa's raspy voice is deeply influenced by the cigarrette-smoking Vargas. What is called haunting voice, or passion, by other reviewers, is a mode of interpretation that Lhasa administers indiscriminately to every song in her repertoire, especially when the CD includes merry Chrismas songs.
__label__1	Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister: Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful.
__label__1	"Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
__label__2	A CD engulfed in GREATNESS !: This CD is amazing. Lhasa and her band demonstrate top musicianship combined with abundant passion. If you are a music fan with a large collection and taste of music, you must add this CD to your collection. It will be among your top 10 favorites. And that goes for music fans with modest CD collections too! And if you get a chance to see them perform live they are even better. I saw her last year in Montreal. Wow!
__label__2	Perfect background music: I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad, and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home. The music is very different and extremely haunting. I have played the tape non-stop and it is perfect background music as it does not disturb ones thoughts at all. I have played it while writing my Christmas cards, and will most certainly look at the other tapes made by Lhana who has a most unusual voice.The rhythm is wonderful and I'm sure would make good party music. Do not be put off by the rather spooky cover painting!!
__label__2	Majestic: This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible, sexy, and captivating. So subtle in its beauty, it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart. I am not fluent in Spanish, but the music totally gets inside your skin. Beautiful arrangements, beautiful melodies, beautiful voice. It can only make your life better.
__label__2	"A fun-filled fantasy adventure: ""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
__label__2	Very fun book: This is a fun book because it is about life in a diminute world sharing times with knights, servants, other different people and Alabaster, the small world wizard.
__label__2	The Castle in the Attic: This book is amazing. I read it when I was a child and couldn't put it down. It has amazing adventure and suspense, without the horrible violence. Several months ago, something reminded me of the book and I had to hunt it down. I had forgotten the title and the author(it had been 15 years since I read it). I finally was able to locate it. I was thrilled. I bought it and read it in just a couple of hours. It is a book I recommend for both children and adults.
__label__2	One of my favorite books as a kid.: This ought to be required reading for every boy or girl between the ages of 8-12. Enjoyable, readable, exciting, and above all, heart-warming.
__label__2	Audio Version: Fun book. Young boy, 10, is given a toy castle by his nanny who is leaving to go back to England. The boy, William, is very upset that Mrs. Phillips is leaving. When he discovers that the castle, or more accurately, the Silver Knight that comes with it, is enchanted, he devises a plan to keep her with him. And thus begins a very satisfying tale of fantasy and heroism.I listened to the audio version of this book - read by the author along with an entire cast. I can't say it was the best audio book I've ever listened to. As often is the case, the reading by the author, while interesting, wasn't great. And it wasn't just the author. I often kept thinking to myself that I wish I had opted to read this one instead of listening to it.
__label__1	Very Disappointed: As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!
__label__2	I liked the book because...: I liked the book Castle In The Attic because it was a book on a Dragon and a Knight. My three favorite parts were when William climbed the tree and got the apple for the cursed man. My other one was when he fought the dragon,and my last one was when William fought Alastor.Other kids should read this book so they will be more interested in reading the sequel Battle For The Castle.
__label__1	I was very disappointed because the cds are stratched and they skip.: I rated this one star because the cds are stratched and they skipped all through the story. I would have sent it back, but I was so sure I could depend on this company. I threw away the returned information. I will have to purchase another CD before I use the novel with another class.I am very disappointed and I will think twice before I order again.Thank you for the opportunity to share.Gloria Gilliard
__label__2	Thi was a great book: My class read the book The Castle in The Attic My whole class liked the book. My favorate part was when Willam got past the dragon.But did he get in the castle? I don't know! You will have to read the book to find out. I recommend you read this book!!!!
__label__2	I like this book.: The book Castle in the Attic is a good book.My favorite part is when william defeated Alastor. There was one other good part in Castle in the Attic. When William was trying to get to Alastors kingdom and the dragon was distracting him with bad visions. I recommend this book to anybody who likes exciting books.
__label__2	Saving the Past And returning to the Present: This book is about a boy who gets a toy castle as a gift and working with a knight going from the present into the past saving a old town from a evil ruler(Alastor).The town was saved and they wanted the knight and the boy to rule their town but the boy refuses and goes back to the present and the knight stays to protect the town from any other evil rulers.
__label__2	I liked it: I love the way Elizabeth Winthrop describes his emotions about Mrs. Phillips leaving. It was exiting and I couldn't put it down!
__label__2	An incredible piece of work!: This book, by Elizabeth Winthrop was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a real page turner! The end of every chapter left me wanting to read on. If you love fantasies too, I strongly recommend you pick up this one today!
__label__2	Very fun to read: My family and I listened to this book on tape when we were driving across the country. It was so fun we didn't want to turn it off. It's about a boy who figures out what's in your heart mattters most. It has a great moral and is very exciting. I recommend this book for everyone.
__label__2	Great kids story: This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet.
__label__2	One of my childhood favorites!: I am 26 years old and I still remember reading this book as a child. I have always loved castles, so the castle layout diagram at the beginning of the book really made me happy and drew me into the world. The cover is different on my edition, so I hope the diagram is still there in this latest printing. I was an avid reader as a child, and I highly recommend this book!
__label__2	Both my daughter and son enjoyed this book.: It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it.It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children.
__label__2	The Castle in the Attic: In the beginning, William is an ordinary boy, but when his toy knight comes alive, and William shrinks, the adventure begins. This book was one of the best books I've ever read. And anyone with a big imagination and a love for adventures will love this book too.
__label__1	The Castle in the Attic: i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring.
__label__1	Castle in the attic: This book was dull non for feeling non inspiring boring made no sense. I would not recomended this book to a friend it is terrible. I rather read something else rather than this book
__label__1	My review: The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight.
__label__2	I like this book!: I like the book Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. My favorite part in the book was when Mrs.Philips gave William a gift. Do you know what the gift was? Can you figure out what it is? I recommend this book because Castle In the Attic is a very exciting novel to read.
__label__2	This was a great book: I read the book The Castle in the Attic and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part was when William meets Sir Simon and sees the castle. I like this part because William gets scared and drops him on the floor. Will they become friends or not? Find out by reading the book.
__label__2	We Love This Book!: My son and I had checked this book out from the public library and he loved it! He was so upset when we had to take it back so I decided to look online. We love Mexican food/culture and he thinks it's so funny after knowing the original song!I was so happy to have found it for his birthday!
__label__1	small: The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small..
__label__2	Soon to be a best seller!: All of Mr Lepp's stories speak to me on a primal, fundamental level, in a place that brings me back to my life as a child.... shyeeha right! Honestly folks, Bil is one of the best guys i have ever met, and his stories have had me rolling with laughter more than once. He and his wife Paula and both salt of the earth, good people, and their belief in God, and the fundamental goodness of Mankind are reasons enough to own this book! Someday, you'll be glad you did!
__label__2	Bubble Gum Crisis: This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have.
__label__2	"tobacco pouch: The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
__label__2	"Raise you off your feet!: Wilmington Chester Mass Choir is incredible. I highly recommend this inspirational gospel choir CD. I especially love the song ""Holy, Holy, Holy"", it alone is worth the price of the CD. You can realyy ""feel"" the Lord when you hear thier music, and you know they mean every word and note of it. Thank you Amazon.com for featuring this CD, I had a hard time finding it anywhere else."
__label__2	Great book!: I really liked this book...it is one of my favorite nightworld books. I think that it was sad that Thea had to leave her family and live with Eric and his mom but I don't think they had much choice.. anyway it's great! And I enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed reading the rest of the Nightworld series..by the way I think that L J Smith is the best!!! Anyway gotta go!!
__label__2	Witches Rule!: I'm glad that L. J. Smith finally put a witch book in her series. I love vampires but it wouldn't really be good if that's all she wrote about in the Night World series. Now she needs to put in a shapeshifter novel and she'll be on a roll. The only thing I don't get about the book is why Thea got expelled with Blaise when she didn't do anything. I hope she became a famous vet.
__label__2	Good Witchy Fun!: This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. I have a thing for witches, and all the information about actual spells, spell ingredients, circle casting, and witch history was simply fascinating. Thea is a great character, and her relationship with her soulmate Eric is endearing, but the real standout star in this book is Blaise.Blaise seems like your typical wicked witch, but despite her disdain for humans (that's how she was raised so you can't really blame her), she's supremely loyal to her family. What she does in the end for Thea almost made me cry.What I love about LJ Smith's books is that the main themes go much deeper than just supernatural characters; her books explore and highlight the importance of relationships, love and loyalty. Spellbinder is one book I know I'll be reading over and over again for the rest of my life.
__label__2	Spellbinder is Spellbinding!: Unlike the first two books in the series Spellbinder switches it's romantic connections to witches insted of vampires. Blaise uses human men as toys till they go crazy, and when she sets her eyes on Eric, Thea's soulmate Thea will do anything to protect him, even if it means breaking the laws of the Night World. A great addition to the series that will have you excited to read more. Though it's a step down from Daughters of Darkness it stands well on it's own.
__label__2	Totally Witchy!: This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever read but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good book and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise's necklace that was cool.I wonder if yemonja really exists and the other spices.It is true that most of LJSmith's books are with witches and vampires and that we don't know what shapeshifters shape into but I liked the spells anyway.Email me if ya wanna chat.
__label__1	"Cheaply made: First time I tried the extractor, it busted off inside the bolt. Very hard metal, but so hard that it is quite brittle. Very little amount of free play, and doesn't let you put any torque on the bolt at all, so if it is rusted in there, forget about this set! Seems like a cheap knock off of the ever so popular ""easy out"" set.Now I have to figure a way out how to get the stupid thing out of my bolt so I can drill a new hole and tap some new threads in. Can't drill it out because the metal is so hard, it is chewing up my drill bits."
__label__2	Don't move, vibrate, tilt or press too hard...: I use these at my automotive school, notorious for un-calibrated torque wrenches and people who don't like reading directions. I would go with professional grade set if your working on rusted bolts, or in awkward or tight situations. Otherwise, for light to medium duty work: Buy 2 of these sets to save on shipping. You will need the extra set. The slightest vibration can snap the bits, they are very brittle. Consider your first set a 'learning set'. If you use them to remove another bit that has broken off in a broken screw, they grind into dust (Doh!). These work great on bolts which have been over torqued or snapped on re-install.
__label__1	Cheap material: This tool is made of cheap material and never work or extract tripped screw. I have tried so many times and eventually have to buy different brand tool to make my work finished
__label__1	Wore the drill bit to a nub...: Do not waste your money on this set! After an hour I had worn the smallest drill bit in the set down to a nub trying to drill through a small transmission bolt on my Pontiac Sunfire. I did get the screw extracted, however, the set was worthless by the time I got the screw out. Also, the extractors are weak. One will need a small torch to heat up the metal to loosen screws and bolts to keep from snapping the extractors.
__label__2	Welcome to 1059 baseball!: This is a great book that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50's
__label__2	"Putting a marriage together again.: Wendie Keith and Teague Blackwell had met on the set of the oldtelevision series, THE LOST ROMANCE RANCH, and fell in love.... As the couple drive on Route 66, they must learn to trust in each other and God.This type of romance will appeal to everyone, even readers who don't normally read ""inspirational"" fiction. God and religion are a part of Teague and Wendie's lives, there is no heavy handed preaching. The Blackwells are normal people with common problems, not saints. This is the first Annie Jones book I have read, but it won't be the last."
__label__2	Indispensable!: While working on an on-going university research project I have spent five years driving the back roads of India. This book has saved my sanity as well as my tires and axles. It is by far and away the most helpful road atlas available.
__label__1	too thin to hold weight: this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner
__label__1	This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD.: This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away.
__label__1	Total waste of money: The developers at Eidos really blew it this time. The game is so full of bugs it makes me sick. First of all, the box says nothing about laptop compatability problems, but upon checking the Eidos tech support page, you learn that they won't support laptop systems.Anyways, I installed the software on my desktop. The game crashes every several minutes. I have installed all of the newest drivers and my computer excedes the recommended hardware profile in every way. Gameplay is tolerable, but nowhere near as good as I had hoped it would be. In fact, Chronicles was more fun and was more of a challenge.I ended up returning the game because it is not only not worth the money, but it is also a waste of time. If you do take the gamble, make sure you buy this game from a store that accepts software returns. Good luck!
__label__1	STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ?: I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time.
__label__2	my game reviews: i enjoyed the game very mutch,i have followed all the layra croft games for years on the play station,playstation one and game cube gameing systems,i am an avid fan of all laura croft tomb raider games.
__label__1	waste of money!!!!!: Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message.
__label__1	Should have waited to release, rather than sacrifice quality: This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. The new control system is extremely clumsy and will leave Lara die-hards wondering what the developers were thinking when they decided to revamp the old one. I hate to say it, but I think EIDOS was more concerned about not missing another promised release date and sent out an unfinished product; the obvious quality issues are apparent in the first chapter and get progressively worse. I would not be surprised if the company has to issue a recall for this defective product. On a positve note, the improved graphics are beautiful, but are hard to appreciate because of the frustrating gameplay.
__label__1	Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY: I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!
__label__1	i've have more fun taking a dump than playing this crap: what a piece of garbage....just thinking of it is making my bowels move...again....OH GOD, i gotta go back on the bowl!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Robocop dressed like Lara Croft: I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame.
__label__1	Don't bother: This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles.
__label__1	Worse than I had previously thought: Spare yourself. Dont waste your money or your time with this game. It's too easy. 30 minutes and I was on the 5th level and never fired a shot. If this is the product they put out after an 8 month delay in release. I cannot imagine how bad this game was before they decided to rework it. I want the original Tomb Raider back. I wasted $... on this game and I know others paid more that I did....
__label__1	big disappointment: After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Although I have a reasonably fast PC 3.06 Ghz and a fair video display, the game is slow and jerky and it crashes or hangs up constantly. Having played all the TR games this is by far the worst. I will be trying to get my money back on this one. If you haven't already bought it don't waste your time or your money.
__label__2	Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness (PC Version): I purchased & played the PC version of Tomb Raider. This version has 2 CDs and both are required to install. The program will recognize your USB controller and will display it on the options screen. You can configure each button to your choice. I recommend that you use a Ten button controller. The directional control is a bit sensitive so be careful not to send Lara over the rail or short fence and have her fall to her demise. The graphics are a big imporovement from the previous versions and the animation is very smooth. The game play is much like the same as the previous five but there are a few new moves to become familiar with. I highly recommend purchasing the PC version it seems that EIDOS has made some improvements to the controls for the PC. Thank you EIDOS!
__label__1	Do Not Buy This Game: Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.
__label__1	Don't waste your money: I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
__label__1	Do not purchase this game!: Let me give you some advice that will keep you from pulling your hair straight out of your scalp... stay away from this game. Don't take just my word for it... alot of folks here feel the same way. Do not listen to those that tell you that all this game needs is a killer machine to run. Believe me, I have a good machine and the controls are still awful! You get tired of yelling at Lara, telling here to get her butt up them stairs! People around you will think your nuts for screaming at the screen. Laura has never looked better, that is true. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's sure nice to look at, that is for sure. But, even if had a ghost of a chance of making Laura go were you wante her to go, you'd still have to deal with bugs, freezes, Laura walking on air, and attrocious angels. Do yourself a favor... stay away.
__label__1	when is this game going to be released??: I can hardly wait for this game and now another disappointment,why don't they be truthful and say when for sure so I can get on with some other game..just waiting with baited-breath, and how long will we have to wait for another after this one,, they need to get with it before I outgrow my need for Laura and I'm only 75 , can't wait much longer, if you know what I mean!!!
__label__1	This [stinks]: I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ...
__label__1	Tomb Stinker - Eidos' Revenge: Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. This game is proof.The graphics are beautiful, which accounts for the extra star for the overall rating. If you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will absolutely hate this game, as I do. The controls, the plot, and the movements are maddening, boring and confusing, respectively. Eidos could plug Tomb Raider 1 into this engine and have a much more interesting game.Maxim magazine gave this game 5 stars. A good reason to ignore Maxim's ratings.
__label__1	Great graphics but no!: I must say when i first heard that TR angel of darkness was coming out i wanted it so bad but after when i beat the game it turned out to be a stupid adventure and im a true fanatic on tomb raider. So far TR 1 TR2 are the best but i hope tomb raider legend will be good i saw the previews it looks good! she actually explores temples i mean whats the purpose of calling it tomb raider when your not in any tombs like tomb raider chronicals! another thing in tomb raider angel of darkness- what the hell happened to her pistols? the only weapons you use are just one pistol gun not 2 , eidos better get it going because the tomb raider franchise is going to the dumps!
__label__2	EXCELLENT!: Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is one of my favorites. The plot is very interesting, the graphics are good (but kind of shakey, at least on my computer), and it's pretty cool to be able to play another character (although Lara is always the best). The environment is very dark and grimacing though, and I find that if I play the game to much, I get a little depressed. It's still one of the best, though, and an awesome addition to the Tomb Raider series.
__label__1	Looks Great - plays horribly: This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and sound, but it is incredibly hard to play. The controls are demented, the camera viewpoints imbecilic. If they had spent a small amount more on making this game playable, it would have been a smash hit. As it stands, this game is not worth the sticker price. I am a long time Tomb Raider fan and I will probably still play this game, but it is just not much fun at all.
__label__1	unusable controls, graphics glitches.: I LOVE the tombraider line. I waited for this game with bated breath......And it was absolutely horrible. :(The controls are so bad, the game is virtually unplayable -- they're sluggish beyond belief! No more fast-paced running & jumping. I literally had to STOP MOVING, in order to perform side jumps! (doesn't work well, when you're being chased by a ball of flame, from an explosion behind you)It crashes randomly.There's graphics glitches all over the place.Should've known it was crap, when the release date kept getting moved back. /sighNote to self: read the reviews before buying another TR game./lms
__label__1	"Bad Eidos, Bad!: Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
__label__1	So far, it's not worth $...: My Tomb Raider game is filled with bugs! Within 10 minutes of downloading it, I had to restart my computer 3 times! When the game does show up, I get a blank screen. I can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures! Whatever I do I cannot get it to work. I've tried so many websites for help! I've waited a year for this and now I wish I didn't get it. Maybe it's just my game? But other people have been having the same problems too. Well, at least the box is cool. |=(
__label__2	Lara croft, angel of darkness: The graphics on this game are really really good.A big downer is the controls, it used to be really easy but now you`ve got no choice but to use the anolog buttons and i hate them!The locations are very detailed and the interaction of friends and enemies is very impressive.But, i`m not sure that it was a good idea to bring in another character.overall, a very good game worth the money, v.good graphics and locations. The only set backs to this game are the controls, and the extra character.
__label__1	NOT IMPRESSED: Just got the game....NOT IMPRESSED! These 5 star reviews must have been written by the makers of the game, cuz this player thinks it [stinks]. Lara's movements are slow and chunky. Movements that used to be simple, such as jump back to get a run forward, has turned into spin Lara around, walk, and spin around again...and since this changes your view of the surroundings it's easy to get confused (camera angles [stink] too) Lara's control is a nuisance and it's NOT worth my time to play this game.
__label__1	One would think.........: Hmmmm, as a veteran of Tomb raider and an someone who plays most of the 1st person shooters that appear I was quite disappointed in the game controls. The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so. It is very frustrating to try and play a very well done story only to continually die for lack of the ability to accurately control Lara's movement. I hope Edios learns from this experience.
__label__1	Come on here people...: This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme.
__label__2	No Game Play Problems On My Machine: Game A+ On Sound TrackA+ On GraphicsA+ On Story LineI haven't had any of the problems that other's have reported like Slow-mo Lara, Audio drop out, Lara Falling out of the game World. To sum it up Tomb Raider AOD is a Best-Buy
__label__2	Exceeds expectations: This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. It is solid piece of work that is easy to move about when doing the deck(s)with wheels that actually work. Santa gave me the one with the roll-up hose which is very nice feature. Only problem was that the User guide didn't have any information on this feature so I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where or how to connect the high pressure hose to unit- Guess What? - No need to connect anything except garden hose. I consider this tool the best buy for your $$$$
__label__2	Gets the job done: It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Unfortunately, the only effective chemical solution is chlorine which acts more or less on its own but cannot be used with this machine. Safe cleaners, such as Simple Green are no more effective than when used without them. Other than that, it's a great product.
__label__1	"Do not buy this Brand!!!: I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
__label__1	Piece of CR--AP - try calling their support !: Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. It failed even the assembly test - the thing is so badly manufactured that the connection to which the pressure hose connects on the body of the washer was completely misaligned. There was no way I could connect the nozzle. OK - I thought it happens. I tried to call their 1-800-521-8559 support number and was on hold for 42 Minutes both on the Customer Service and Sales lines and then they cut me off. I did not even talk to a human! Their website is a joke. This is a typical bottom of the barrel Chinese company trying to dump poorly built stuff on the consumer. DO NOT BUY this and encourage such companies that dont give a hoot about the customer.I'm returning this and telling every retailer to dump this.AM
__label__1	Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it.
__label__1	Worked at first: When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so.
__label__2	McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer: I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far.
__label__1	failed after 2nd application: i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product
__label__1	Kindle Buyer Beware!: Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here.
__label__2	Good Introduction....: Well-made book. Informative with excellent photography. The overall layout is quite conducive to interrupted reading - easy to pick up and start anywhere.
__label__2	"Excellent Introduction to Philosophy Text: If you teach Introduction to Philosophy using a historical approach, this is the text I recommend. I used ""The Philosophic Classics 2nd edition, From Plato to Nietzsche"" for my classes and was looking for a text with the same basic works with some more contemporary materials. I find the updated 3rd edition, ""From Plato to Derrida"" the perfect solution. Instead of having to look through more textbooks for the right stuff, this is it."
__label__2	Who thought philosophy would be fun??: Great study of major philosophies that have impacted our western culture. Very enjoyable and easy reading, yet stimulating and intellectual...Loved the book!
__label__2	Fast and in good shape: It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks
__label__2	Philosophic Classics: There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book.
__label__2	"REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT!: So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
__label__2	Read this book!: This is one of my favorite fishing books. I'm reading it now for the third time. It's about a lifestyle that would make most of us jealous. If you enjoy surf fishing, then this book is a must.
__label__1	You can skip this one: This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it.
__label__2	The Way is Was: Great look at the past of striped bass fishing on the Cape. Money, politics and fishing competition made this a great read for the avid bass angler. A time never to be visited again. The man became intergrated into the life cycle of the striped bass. As the seasons and years changed , so did the man, so did the politics, so waned the competition, so lost was the inner workings of his family. A time to remember and a time remember less.
__label__1	Guess i missed what was cool: I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it.
__label__1	HOME MADE, Lowest Budget Film...: ********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!
__label__1	"MISLEADING DESCRIPTION: The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"
__label__2	Gorgeous!!!: This Stainless Steel & Glass Diner Cake Set is gorgeous! If your thinking of getting it for yourself or a gift, dont hesitate, you will not be disappointed! The glass dome is heavy which is great, not flimsy thin glass at all. Looks great sitting on our buffet.
__label__2	Wonderful CD slightly misleading title: This is one of my favourite Jewish Choral CDs of all time yet I agree with other reviewers that this is not representative of the Jewish choral tradition of the UK. This should have been a double CD set with the first featuring really traditional music and the second exposing us to the new genre of mainly modern Reform choral and organ music.Both Moshe and the choir excel themselves. The master mixing is not good and one can hear obvious retakes and splits in the music which is unfortunate. I've not idea what Oseh Shalom by Nurit Hirsh is doing on the CD!The music of the modern mainly reform composers Lipkin, Josephs, Singer is wonderful. If I had to choose three pieces to take to a desert island, I would take Ma Yedidot by Charles Salaman, Aneh Ani by Verrinder and Psalm 23 by Rideout. Three magnificent works.I believe the company, Olympia, no longer functions so there won't be many more CDs available. If it's still available, grab one!
__label__1	An opportunity missed: I'm sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. There are far too many modern pieces by contemporary Jewish composers, many of which would be considered quite out of place in an actual English synagogue service, particularly of the more traditional style. The leading composers of the Anglo-Jewish liturgical tradition such as Samuel Alman and Abraham Saqui are very poorly represented; even Israel Mombach, the English equivalent of Solomon Sulzer or Louis Lewandowski, only has 3 pieces on the album - and only one of those is typical. Finally, several of the pieces are instrumental (for organ) without any singing at all, which has little relevance to the choral music of the album's title.I have heard the Zemel Choir live, and on this CD they seem rather recessed and timid. Overall, a disappointing release.
__label__2	IT'S A GOOD DAY TO BE A TROJAN!: This is terrific stuff. Southern California is a college with the first or second greatest college football tradition of all times, and this book describes how, after a long layoff, Pete Carroll has returned the Trojans to these previous heights.
__label__1	Bad quality: I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!
__label__1	Good support, but expensive and not durable!: I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade.
__label__1	ran the first time I wore them: I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now. I havenever had a problem. I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair....great for summer. The third time I wore one pair,I got a hole in them. I am not even sure how that happened. I figuredI must have done something. I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them...the same leg (right one). Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again.
__label__1	Also ran the first time I wore them: I put them on at the doctor's office and the first time I had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. Otherwise, liked them very much.
__label__1	Bad run the FIRST time I wore them!: Having read the previous reviewers' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs, I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last. The first time I had this pantyhose on, I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery! Unbelievable!
__label__2	Interesting performance: I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection.
__label__1	"Danger.....: Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
__label__2	"A MUST FOR ANYONE TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE BUSINESS: For so long the shelves of any given bookstore have been crammed with books claiming to be ""the book that every actor needs"", but yet they read like a foreign language and don't give the information an actor really needs for his or her big break. Ms. McGregor has broken through that barrier and released a book that spells out many of the details actors need to know about acting and the audition process. Intelligent and informative, the book is packed with everything an actor/actress could possibley need! A must for anyone trying to break into the business."
__label__2	Super Helpful: This book showed me that I dont have to live in LA or New York to get into acting. Also It gave me alot of helpful hints on all aspects in landing a role.
__label__1	Received melted: I am sure this is delicious as it had been recommended to me.However, it was completely melted when I received it, thepackage did not state PERISHABLE and the postage was expensive.I would not buy from this particular site again.
__label__1	WARNING - Does Not Help: This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here).
__label__1	"Characters are stagnant and boring. Not fun.: I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the ""mood"" is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main ""character"" of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."
__label__1	"A disappointing and frustrating read: I was eager to read this book because it's set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. She has talent, it's undeniable, but Scott is far too enchanted with her own writing to tell a decent story. Every time I found myself beginning to be captivated by the narrative or the chatacters, I'd stumble across a highly polished, self-conscious set-piece of prose that screamed ""HEY! Look at me...don't I write well?!"" After a second attempt to finish this book I am giving up on it and moving on."
__label__1	Victorian???Hardly!: To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions. It might have been more accurate to have titled this a Collection of 18th -20th Century Erotica
__label__1	"Almost Useless: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AMAZON KINDLE EDITIONNot worth having. The work is not scanned in properly. It lacks a hyperlinked table of contents. SO if you want to find ""A Man with a Maid"" you have to click through all the pages between here and there to get to it. That sort of spoils the moment so to speak.Heck the table of contentsR e a d s l i k e t h i sHow hard is it to do the job right?This publication detracts from the Kindle's reputation. Amazon ought to withdraw it."
__label__1	"Truncated: It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could read an entire novel. For example, The ""Romance of Lust"" selection doesn't do its author justice. The original is a big book, wherein the author couldn't possibly have held a job anywhere since he devoted his entire day to erotic diversions. No one was safe, not even his aunt and sisters. Well, maybe the family dog. Other selections were uninteresting too. Is the editor really a Major? Why do we need his military rank in such a book? Is he still in active duty???"
__label__1	Waste of money: This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money
__label__1	not so reckless: First of all, the wire came out as i was untangling the cord, so it is very fragile. It is too tall. It's ears are too high above my girl's clit for her too feel anything. It's not the greatest thing in the world, and i do not recommend that you buy it. huge disappointment.
__label__1	Not fun, not comfortable!: This product looked fun but in reality was very uncomfortable and it vibes only at the middle! It's also very large (long) and didn't fit very well! Anyway, in summary, a neat idea, but not a staple or even fun for a one time use!
__label__1	It is hard to describe just how bad this is.: I like Billie Holiday.I like dance remixes.I just love the Sarah McLachlan remix CD.I feel I have a very open mind and a very diverse taste in music which ranges from country to classical to classic rock to dance/trance to pop. U2, Tiesto, Bach and Garth. As long as it sounds good.Which this doesn't. There are two basic problems. First, Billie's attraction was her syrupy lingering over the sound. It oozes sexuality but not the rhythmic mechanical pelvic thrusting kind. Second, when you take a sound track that is utterly devoid of rhythm and *then* do a bad job of adding a dance backdrop, the result is just too wierd for words.I can only conclude that this CD was released as some kind of joke just to prove that people will buy *anything*.Well, I bought and I'm sorry...
__label__1	Atrocious.: I purchased this on a whim because, hey, I like Billie Holiday... so remixes could be fun, right? I couldn't have been more wrong. What was done to this music can only be described as a travesty at best - an ugly cacophony of cheap electro beats over Billie's beautiful voice. This could have been done well. There's great potential, but this? Not even passable. Don't even give this one a second glance.
__label__1	"A Desecration: Hideous. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because 0 stars isn't an option. The very idea of remixing ""Strange Fruit"" is tastless and disturbing."
__label__2	works well: I used this tool for at least 4 days a week for at least a few months for several hours a day until i sold it to a coworker when i bought a Dynabrade turbine powered 100,000 rpm pencil grinder....which really sucked and had little to no torque whatsoever. so it was usless to me and I completely regret buying that expensive p.o.s.. I used the Sioux to put some heavy edge breaks on some very hard metal parts. So I put alot of pressure on this tool alot. For the most part it had a good amount of torque. The wedges on the inside of the pencil grinder eventually broke after a few months but that was after a whole lot of abusive work done with it and those wedges are very easily replaced and cheap. this pencil grinder works well with even titanium and inconel which are very hard metals
__label__1	"Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am: This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
__label__2	DON'T go to ebay. Nothing except bootlegs and crooks.: It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?
__label__2	Whispers of the Dead: I love all the Sister Fidelma stories, and these short story anthologies are particularly interesting. I'm building quite a collection on my Kindle.
__label__1	I am not impressed with this product!: I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. The construction is very flimsy and the little tabs that hold the bag in place are VERY VERY hard to get off!. After several months, it now can barely stand up by itself and I have to constantly tighten the wheels and other screws. It would be nice if it was better made and sturdier and if it had a cover to keep out the flies...It seemed like a great idea, but the products is not well made.
__label__1	Not worth the money.: When this product arrived parts were missing. When we tried to assemble it the welded joints fell apart. I wouldn't waste the money. Buy another type bag holder.
__label__1	Don't Waste Your Money: This product although is a very good idea is cheaply constructed and the clips that hold the trash bag in place are very hard to get on and off and you end up ripping the trash bag. Keep your twenty bucks and give it to one of your kids as payment to hold that trash bag for you.
__label__1	Cheaply made product: I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all.
__label__1	Flimsy Bag Holder: The product seemed like a good idea but wish I had read all of the reviews before ordering. The product is not sturdy at all. It didn't come with the number of screws noted on the instructions so I had to go out and purchase more in order to finish putting it together. That was after I spent way to much time trying to decipher the instructions. Also, the clips that hold the bag to the frame are very tight and very difficult to put on and remove. I've torn every bag I've used. I hate wasting my money; but, I'll have to buy a better one.
__label__1	It is OK but not great.: The directions to put this together were unclear and failed to note that you need to use really oversized bags. After a few uses the sides have already broken. The clips are really hard to put on and off the the rack.
__label__1	flimsy: poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing.
__label__1	Defective Parts: The parts are defective and not what is shown on package. The round top ring that holds the bag ends up being at a 45 degree angle because the side bars are defective. What is seen on package is not what is in package so the final product is not at all what is advertised.
__label__1	mismached: The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money
__label__1	Rolling Leaf Bag Holder: I order this on April 5, 2011 and return it to Taylor Gifts on April 11, 2011 they received it and I requested a credit to my account on MasterCard as of May 12th 2011 I have not received a credit. I DID NOT Like this product it was not sturdy enough. Please help me.Mary Lane28 Bonaire DriveHampton,VA 23669Mlane27716@aol.com
__label__1	Very disappointed: The product is very bad. The spot weld connecting the metal hoop to the main upright failed, and one of the support rods sprung free when the connecting screw stripped the threads holding it. This all occurred after only using this product three times. The pieces are in my garage waiting to be disposed of. Don't waste your money.Joe G.
__label__1	don't waste your money: The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
__label__2	"The other side of ""A brave new world "": This science fiction novel walks around the speculative situation about a natural (not social and not even political choice) population distribution, in agreement his skills and gifts.Naturally many facts occur in this interesting tale , but the most remarkable issue is to make us think the elusive dreams about a better and even pacific society."
__label__1	Have any reviewers actually read this?: The synopsis of this book sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. The book starts off kind of entertaining but with a bit of rambling but you figure as you go on, it will probably subside. It doesn't. The characters keep going on and on about buddhism, sex and mushrooms. The plot barely starts and barely ends. This is a book with no journey and no destination.
__label__2	Enlightening: This is truely an amazing book, Aldous Huxley was a genius. Although different from BNW in that the plot is a little slow, the ideas of society and the individual expressed in this book make it one of the most influential books that I ever read. Don't read this book to be entertained, read it to be enlightened.
__label__2	Still Resonates: Island is an excellent novel that, even after 50 years, remains relevant because the story line resonates in terms of how we humans consistently, perhaps not consciously, but most assuredly, and maybe even inevitably, undermine the foundations of utopia through our daily actions, decisions and attitudes.
__label__2	"Published in 1962, but still relevant!: I absolutely loved this book! Eckhart Tolle in ""The Power of Now"" actually references this book and that is how I heard of it. Despite the fact that much of the book is ruled by long monologues from the characters, I enjoyed it all. Huxley had an interesting view of what a society can become when it takes the best of the Eastern and Western worlds combine."
__label__1	"NOT VERY GOOD.....: I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("
__label__1	Dull, dull, dull. Slog you way thru. If you can.: Disappointing. Very. Nothing happens. Huxley pontificates. Spare me. Can see why he's only known for one book. Skip this one.
__label__1	"I would rather chew my leg off than have you read this book.: Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."
__label__2	A different slant on perfectionism: To me the main value of this book was its advice about dealing with the perfectionism of a gifted child. Gifted-parenting books frequently bring up the problem of perfectionism, but I have not found much useful advice for dealing with it. Dr. Klein offers some practical suggestions and the insight that former gifted children may have their own perfectionist tendencies to reckon with.
__label__1	What About the Rest of US?: I gave this book one star because the author, in the beginning of the book, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. That is one of the reasons I bought the book and some of the information was useful.Now, on to the rest... Upon reading this material, I found it to be a self pat on the back from the author on her impressive portfolio of wealthy clients. I found plenty of information if I were an extremely rich person living in a community where the schools for the gifted were plentiful. All of her clients were fabulously well to do and their children were profoundedly gifted. So what about the rest of us? My husband is gainfully employed and I am a student. We have a modest income and our son is gifted. We found little practical advice for ordinary working parents. If you gross less than $200,000 a year, I would try another book.
__label__1	Not this one: I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one.
__label__2	Helpful Information: I found this book extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. The book has great insight and information, plus plenty of real-world examples of how parents deal with issues unique to gifted children. One puzzling thing, though, was the notion that there's an anti-gifted bias and that parents of gifted children are somehow seen by educators as meddlers or pushy parents. The author also seems to have the idea that public schools don't know how to deal with gifted children. That hasn't been my experience so far (our public school has an excellent GT & HGT program) and don't expect it to be as my children get older.
__label__1	Simply Borred: Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla! I spected that this book would say something about ancient phylosopy, something to think about, but never get it, it is very borred.
__label__2	What an inspirational story with a great message!: What a great story! This documentary has such a compelling message and is a fun watch! Very entertaining and inspirational. I highly recommend you watch this video and share this page with your friends. The 3 C's that are lessons within the documentary are lessons that are unfortunately lacking in this day and age... the sorta of lessons that every child should learn. It's too bad that most adults I meet don't possess these 3 C's :)
__label__2	Subway Baby: What an adorable little boy and enchanting story. You really get a reality check about bringing up children in the city.
__label__1	Home Video: A woman (with a child in a state of perpetual tantrum) straps a camera to a stroller to see who will help her carry it. This is a video about how one person's poor planning can become everyone's problem! I looked for the story in it, but couldn't find one, so I shut it off.
__label__1	Top 10: This book doesn't make sense. I am pretty sure Christians already have a Top 10 list if you know what I mean. I bet THE MAN is pretty upset about this. James Moore went all Casey Kasem on him and tried to trump HIS list. Anyway, it's your call, but I think I'm sticking with the list that dates back to B.C. and has guided the morals of man ever since, while playing a major role the development of early legal systems which has an impact present in almost all forms of modern law and faith.Nice try James Moore.
__label__2	Lots of action: A thrilling story of get rich quick without scruples. It introduces the reader to excellent characterizations of the individuals involved. There is excitement through unusual circumstances including an extremely imaginative ending.
__label__1	Save your money: I'm a fan of silent films, especially the long German epics. I'm not a big fan of silent comedies, but I do enjoy them occasionally, especially Chaplin. Although I've seen my share of poor quality films, this set is virtually unwatchable. Besides the poor quality of the print, title cards are missing, long scenes are cut out, half the heads are not visible in many scenes and they have the most annoying musical score I've ever heard. I won't waste any more of my time typing or your time reading. Although $18 for 32 shorts may sound like a good deal, it isn't. Take the $18 and put it toward Chaplin's 3 Essanay Vol's or his 90th anniversary Mutual set. You won't believe the difference. After purchasing those sets, I threw this one away. Now I'm just waiting for someone to restore Chaplin's Keystone shorts with Mabel Normand.
__label__1	overpriced/uncomfortable: These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1.99 a pair--(commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores).
__label__1	Wrong title and director: There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes.
__label__1	pretty rough, but it shows promise: The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again.
__label__2	Sirus Blacks Escape: This is a pretty cool set. The only thing wrong is that is should be a little taller like in the movie. This set really recreates the tower in the movie. The only thing wrong is the door. It should be like a prison door like in the movie, not a wooden one. Some good things about this is only one of two sets that have buckbeak, one of four sets that have a dementor, and only one of two sets that have Sirus Black. I RECOMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS!!!
__label__2	Gorgeous Glass: Cake stand is so impressive-lovely to display any type of pastry,or cake. Domed lid is high and very functional-tall enough to cover a large cake or large amount of pastry. It is versitile in the way that you can reverse the bottom and top to create a beautiful punch bowl or serving bowl for a bowl-type dessert. As a matter of fact, I was so impressed the day it came in I re-ordered 2 more-one for my mother and 1 for my aunt!! Until now we had never seen a square pedestal & dome! You will not be dissapointed with this piece.
__label__1	Would like it if it ever arrived in one piece!: I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this.
__label__1	Broken in a million pieces: I ordered this item twice and both times it was broken in a million pieces and it has been discontiued by Anchor Hocking so I never got any of them. so sad as it looked really nice and different so beware if you order
__label__1	"shipping problem: Ordered this as a wedding gift. It was shipped twice and it was broken both times. Amazon would not give the ""recipients"" credit for something else, had to go though me. Realy spoiled the gifting experience."
__label__2	The Best Live Harmony You can Get!: Absolutely the best in Harmony from a great group. The Live performance is one of the best and really brings out their strength as performers and entertainers.
__label__2	A great Baby pillow!: This is just an adorable little pillow. It will be great as an added decoration in my baby room. Remember this is a BABY pillow, so it is smaller and not made for an adult. The person who previously gave this pillow a rating thought it was too flat and small, but I found it was perfect for a baby room:) Plus! It's a perfect match to the Nautica 4 piece crib set.
__label__1	"A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book: The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
__label__2	"[BOOM!]: Sodom Came, they went.I had listened to 'Masquerade In Blood' and 'Till Death Do Us Unite' and I knew the war that was Sodom was over, the ceasefires had been signed. When you end an album with a song called ""Hey Hey Rock 'n' Roll Star"" after putting out crap that just screams ""We wanna be punk and are failing miserably at it!"" I knew it was over. Saddened, I went to survey the damage.And That's when I heard the Air Raid Sirens.Code Red is the comeback album of all time. Sodom has snapped back into place, I don't know why, but they're rocking harder and heavier than they ever have. This is not for ""Limp Bizkit"" fans, you get your ears and a greater part of your head ripped off and handed to you. And that's the way it should be.Notable Tracks are Liquidation, The Vice of Killing, Code Red, and Addicted to Abstinance."
__label__2	"Thrash Metal Survives: While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. Sodom is one of those bands. The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal. Are they repeating themselves? Most likely, but I'd far rather listen to this material than any other ""metal"" being released by ""progressive, forward-thinking"" bands like Korn; turn up ""Addicted to Abstinence"" or ""Visual Buggery"" and forget nu-metal exists."
__label__1	"still the same old guys...: Hello again, here we are. This is what I think after listening to the new album of Germanys' Thrash-Metal godfathers.Nothing new but still they rock like hell. Unfortunately they made a step backwards and not like Slayer or Mayhem a step forward. Well, I believe that some old school fanatics will enjoy this feature, but Sodoms'great days are gone. Their last good record was and will be ""Tapping the Vein"". I was a great fan of them for over 12 years but they just repeat themselves. I am not happy about giving such a cruel review about this record but I just had to say that. Sorry guys, better luck next time, ok?"
__label__1	Seriously flawed AI and interface killed the game: It is an excellent concept completely spoiled by bad design!In the heat of the battle an extra click on already selected group can select ALL of you troups and instead a single move/attack you have all your army moving to a position. In this time the CPU kills you with ease.There is no EASY way to tell the arches to shoot a specific target. Especially if there are 10 enemy troops rushing towards you in a pack. As a result they don't shoot the critical ladders but some stupid axeman. Short while after that you have all the ladders on your walls and in a minute all the enemy army is in your camp. Even if you survive this then it is real pain to target the ladders on the walls. You can spend a minute to shoot down one and the CPU does not wait that much.THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME!
__label__1	this games sucks: this game sucks so much dont buy this its full of glitches and stuff people can take over your stuff even if your in them and destroy your villages it take 20000000 words to describe how bad this game is in summary dont waste your money on this game buy something anything else!
__label__2	The best tactical game of all times!: Guys, I have to admit - I'm not a big time tactical strategy fan, but this game totally got me on the hook. I like Starcraft, Warcraft III and Age of Empires, but couldn't imagine that a game like Praetorians can grab me and never let me go.I've been playing the multiplayer skirmish demo since it came out - I've never played a demo version of the game for more than an hour!!! It's AMAZING. Plain amazing. The strategy is beautiful, all the terrain tricks, everything you could expect from a real battle. ... - the troop building model there is so beautiful that I can hardly type these words now, I want to get back to the game. I love it!!! If you love any kind of RTS games, this is a MUST in your collection!
__label__2	"Great strategy game!: I had experience of RTS games (Total Annihilation, Age of Empires and Empire Earth) and after I bought Praetorians and played the first time, I found it very very interesting.It's not the typical RTS game where you have to produce a lot of units and simply attack the enemy (like for example TA kingdoms or others) but you have to think in a strategic way before moving and attacking the enemy. In this game, mission by mission, you learn how to balance your troops and how to move in the territory. It's important the fact that troops can interact with territory (hills, woods). You can hide your troops, you can stay higher than the enemy and then attack you enemy suddenly (for example,if your bowmen are in a higher position they will hurt more seriously the enemy). In some missions you have to lay siege to a fortess with war machines.To sum up, I think it's a good game, if you want to enjoy yourself and live the experience of ""De Bello Gallico""!"
__label__1	Disappointing: I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he's never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I'd say ok for someone who doesn't really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I'd save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven't got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!
__label__1	Pretty but simple: I had this game for almost a week before I sold it to EB Games (when they were still buying used PC games). If you're looking for more of Rome: Total War just get the expansion pack, not this. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so limited that I felt like I was watching someone else play. The units were way too small and the controls weren't very fluid. Having never been a fan of stragedy games before, I went on the prowl for some after Medieval: Total War but found that Total War games are the only ones I like. Some others like the technical aspects of campaigning in other games, but I'm more of a battle map player. So if you loved Total War, stick with it. Stay away from similiar games.
__label__1	A Rookie Game: Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it.
__label__2	One of the best: My wife purchased this game for my B-day. So far, I really like the game.I like playing Warcraft, Starcraft, and C&C series. However, I was getting bored of managing resources (e.g. gold, timber, food)I was looking for a game with more strategy rather than resource building.I remember the first time I played Myth and I like the concept of the game. Praetorian is a mixture of Myth and Warcraft. There is less resource managment and more strategy on fighting. Praetorians' graphics, sounds and game play is top notch.
__label__2	Enjoyable: I admit that I haven't finished the game yet but I've been enjoying playing it the last couple of days.Basically you command legions of the Romans. Archers, legionares, horsemen etc. On a terrain you have to beat the enemy.The units all have their special abilities, it's best to have spearman at the front to stop the enemy, horsemen to do quick attacks and archers for long range attack. Because of differences in heights it is important to have archers on higher positions.This all makes for fun. The graphis are really not great but I think most strategy-games players like me are not really interested in that. The sounds are fun and it has good historical accuracy with the names of all the tribes and their leaders.Worth the low price
__label__2	Praetorians is a pretty much must!: Although this game is great, I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could. First the good: Beautiful graphics (the scenery is almost like real), the campaign has a story (unlike some RTS games that have no campaign or story), skirmish mode is fun but sometimes too quick, great gameplay, and it runs nicely. The bad: The units are sometimes kind of dumb (they stand and do nothing sometimes when they are told to go somewhere), the unit graphics could have been a little more sharp, and there aren't many units (this is not really that bad but I would have liked more units; there are 9 different combat units for the Romans). Don't let the bad things sway you from buying the game. Unless you are a real critic than the bad things would make you very mad.
__label__1	Elementary Differential Equations: [..]Let me warn all potential customers that this book is all about quantity of material instead of quality. While the book does cover such advanced topics as Fourier Analysis and intro to Partial Differential Equations, the book lacks sufficient examples about what is being said (a number of sections have no examples at all).I did find the most well-written sections to be the application of second-order differential equations (applied to spring oscillations etc.) However, as far as getting a bang for your buck, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Morris Tennenbaum and Harry Polland's Ordinary Differential Equations Dover edition (cheaper, and MUCH MORE effective. Trust me).
__label__1	I second that!: I agree with the review dated March 14, 1999. I'd also like to add that as of Chapter 2, I've found at least three misprints in the solutions manual. Normally, these types of mistakes are not that much of a problem. But this should be unacceptable for any decent technical writing, especially mathematics.
__label__1	Difficult to follow: I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book.
__label__1	Not helpful...: I decided to self study AP environmental science, which I eventually received a 5 for. This was a textbook I was considering to use, but I found it to be difficult to read (not to mention a bit politically-oriented). I would recommend Raven and Berg for APES, which is more concise and comprehensive for the test.
__label__1	"Not my taste in music: Voice too ""breathy"" to suit my taste. I wouldn't say it is bad; just not the kind of music that I like."
__label__2	"AFX - Smojphace: I think AFX's take on ""Run the Place Red"" is incredibly fun -- it makes me want to jump and shimmy each time I hear it. Now, I'm not a huge fan of ragga, but ragga-jungle-drill 'n' bass? I think it's a genius combination, one that only the demented mind of Mr. James could discover. You can barely understand the vocals beneath the percussion -- they're more flavor than anything else. As for the two noise tracks, they're rather interesting the first time around (not to mention intense on the squeals), but I don't think they stand up to repeated listens. Mostly because I don't want to go deaf."
__label__1	"ok mr.: i like everything aphex twin has ever made (with the exception of ""elephant song""), but this album is a piece of poo covered crust (thats right ""crust""!). i think mr. smiley here is just releasing the stupidest stuff he's ever made as some sort of artsy fartsy nut chunk because these songs stink flamboyantly. the first song features a reggae ""artist"" who has too much self esteem (if your gonna get excited about something dont make it reggae lyrics). anyway i hate lyrics, so i'm a little biased. the other parts in the song consist of drums...and some other insignificant effects. the other songs consist of only the latter; no music just stuff (which i know is arguably music also, but jeez 9 minutes then the next song is the exact same stuff). now i've gone and soiled myself i hope smiley mcgee is happy."
__label__1	What a disapointment.: Two years, and this is all we get? The first song is decent. It has some rap/reggae guy doing his vocal thang, with RDJ's music behind the background. Except for the first 10 seconds, the music itself exceptional. Nice crazy d'n'b stuff with vocals. This song is worth getting, but not for $$$ ! The other two tracks... they are just noise. It's as if he hooked up electrodes to his recording equipment and twiddled with the knobs or something. Or maybe he had real songs and then encrypted them. Who knows! They are not music. They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ.
__label__1	Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno: but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn't that like an oxymoron?
__label__2	Super Cool: If you're a Muffs fan, ya gotta love this incredible collection of outtakes, rarities, covers and whatever. Sure, first time Muffs buyers should pick up the first or second album, but this one is great if you're already sold on the band.
__label__2	"very good: OK ""fan"" from tx- you obviously have no clue of what you are talking about. First of all, the Muffs just DID have a break through record with Alert Today Alive Tomorrow. They released this cd so there dedicated fans unlike yourself would have a chance to here all of there lost material. Get the facts before you say anything you don't have a clue about. Anyway this cd isn't for someone who is just getting into the muffs but any fan should get it right away. Even if your not a fan it has many good songs but there are also some mediocre ones. All in all- very good"
__label__1	Don't Bother w/the Muffs...just Noise.: Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you.
__label__2	Amazing!!!!: These puzzles are absolutely hilarious! Yet again, I'm blown away by the exquisite surprises, twists and turns. I've been stumped on a few of them for a few days now, but I'm not giving up! Shortz is, hands down, a genius. Try your hand at the masterful art within these pages, and enjoy the furrowed brow and laughs!
__label__2	Bringing the Big Picture into View: This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend.
__label__2	Fun fun fun!!!: ...BR>This is an awesome book made by real people ... and by an awesome company! My cousin has this book and I have done three of the rings already. They are easy to do and the directions are well explained and not too complex.The rings include: simple ring (you should learn to do this first), twisted ring, chain, vine, butterfly, starburst, and daisy chain. This book has plenty of beads so you can do your favorite rings over and over!The only complaint I have is there's this stupid bead wheel (you've seen it on the front picture) and the colors get mixed up if you take it on a car trip, or when you're flipping through different colors.Otherwise, this is a great book and I highly reccomend it for someone who is interested in making bead rings!
__label__2	Great gift: My dds gave these as gifts to their friends recently, and EVERYONE loved them! They have all spent hours making rings, and I must admit, they were really cute! The directions were easy to follow, and my 10 yr old had no problem making them on her own.
__label__2	Advaita seminar: '`Living from Neutrality' by Justus Kramer Schippers is not an introduction to Advaita but, rather, is an excellent seminar in that philosophy. Neither sweet nor patronizing, Schippers is a plain-spoken adult who expects his reader to be an adult, as well. I enjoyed Schippers' insights and expect to read this book several more times in the forthcoming years.
__label__1	"This compilation befuddles me.: This compilation befuddles me.The sound is a bit muffled on the tracks listed as 2000 remastered when compared with the John Denver's Greatest Hits.Not all tracks are 2000 remastered. Calypso and I'm Sorry are listed as 1975. They sound and look like the same files as Denvers's Greatest Hits when brought into audacity editing software.It also seems the 2000 remasters are not the original arrangements.I have both this ""Best of Rocky Mountain"" and Best of Volume 1 & 2.The Rocky Mountain version does dull or soften Denver's voice. Some may like that.But if dulls the instruments.I prefer the Best of Volumes. They are sharper with more detail to the instruments."
__label__1	"Beware the words ""digitally remastered"": If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. I turned it off after 5 tracks because I couldn't bare to listen to it any more. I had the feeling that someone had rummaged through some old discarded session tapes and had played them back through a pillow. The arrangements were definitely not what I was expecting and the quality was awful. I gave this recoding 1 star but only because they wouldn't let me out of the screen without filling in that field!"
__label__2	Never heard of her before: I am pretty familiar with the great jazz singers, though not a great jazz fan.A friend shared this with me and I was blown away.Now everyone has different tastes, but I have always thought Nina Simone the best. The sheer volume of Nina's work gives her an advantage in the expanse of material.But vocally, and in terms of phrasing and lyrics Gloria is also great.And yet she was contemporary more or less with most of the great jazz singers of her era, being born about 8 years after Ella Fitzgerald.Fame is fickle though and for whatever reason Gloria remains way underappreciated.I love all of her songs on this cd.In one she sings like a Buddhist about how everyone gets older, everything recedes into the past in a way that transcends most pop song ditties to say the least.It is in a class with Nina's Who Knows Where the Time Goes.
__label__2	El libro mas completo que existe para nosotras,: las m,ujeres embarazadas o por embarazarnos...LO ABARCA TODO, DESDE LA CONCEPCION HASTA QUE EL BEBE CUMPLE UN AÑO...Dulce, sabio y ameno...
__label__2	When I found out I was pregnant, I felt both: joyful and scared by my absolute ignorance on the matter...This book is so complete, that I lost my fear, kept my joy and never needed another one!
__label__1	The characters seem unrealsitic and have a very bad attitude: I don't understand how Clarence Day, a good author, wrote this wretched book. A father should not be that vulgar, and shouldn't treat his wife with that much disrespect. People may find homor in it, but I did not enjoy this
__label__1	Not good: I didn't find this book at all interesting.. all though there was occasional humor.. in general, i didn't enjoy this piece of literature.
__label__2	"Enjoyable memoir: I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a ""father"" type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."
__label__2	"Life with Father (by Clarence Day): I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel ""Life with Mother"" too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."
__label__1	"misleading item description.: My order was for a complete set which was supposed to be 11 volumes but the package came with only 9 volumes. I contacted the seller he replied that he has mentioned in his post that it had only 9 volumes which does not make sense. If he was offering 9 volumes only he should not have this under "" Complete Set"". plus the order came 10 days after my order placement. Not happy with the sellers service at all."
__label__2	It's my favorite book about 5 years: There are many funy things about money, wishes and so on. I smile every time when read their. When I have some problem in my life I get this book and read from any place I opened the book. And all the time I start to feel better.
__label__1	Promising, but a let down.: Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one.
__label__1	"Simplistic, humorous book on life.: This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."
__label__2	real life saver: I received this book from my ex-wife just after our divorce. At first I thought it was a crule joke. But after reading the life 101 book I realized that she could have given me A great gift.. Like the book states, Not all parts will pertain to you at this time, but it is a wonderful refference for later... I have purchased at least 15 of these books. and given them all away.. I usually buy one for myself and start rereading it when someone will say something that relates to a chapter in the book and I point it out to them and the next thing you know there goes another book... at this price it is easy to give them away... MR BILL
__label__1	A Waste of Money and Time: I got nothing out of this book. I've read many self-help books, and this is among the worst. McWilliams provided worn-out cliches, and the book reads slowly. If you want good selp-help books, check out Denis Waitley and Anthony Robbins.
__label__1	Total disappointment: I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it.
__label__1	A highly mixed blessing (?!): The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the reader with all the simplifications and self-pity. Please read some literature instead.
__label__1	"It's never too late to write a ""self-improvement"" book: Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
__label__1	Sad: What happened to the amazing Charlie Mars from Like A Bird, Like A Plane?? That was an incredible haunting deep pleasing album. This is not :(
__label__2	YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEIR FIRST CD: Ok i admit that this cd isn't the greatest for charlie mars, but their first cd is really good and its called broken arrow and i love it. if you aren't from the south then don't even bother listening to this music.
__label__1	"has the lead singer lost his focus?: I was recently in dallas and visited the gypsy tea room where this band was playing. The band only had one good song and it was only good due to the guitars. the lead singer has a bad voice and at the end of the performance he says to the crowd ""thanks for coming to see me play"". he said this to the 40 people still there. anyway i noticed he had 3 other people on stage that were BAND MEMBERS. I could tell that the drummer was ticked about that comment and was overheard saying""he, the lead singer, has lost his focus"".sad very sad"
__label__1	HA!: I know bad music when I hear it. Here 'tis. The lead singer is the main problem, the band are not too bad, just apparently under the leadership of this mo. Go back to mommy and daddy in TX.
__label__2	Quick Service: This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores. I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt. I would have given it five stars but he hasn't had time to try them on yet so I can't give a perfect score.
__label__1	"Too short product & too bad shipping process: I got the black stockings in size A/B. They are way off too short. Almost 1"" above my knees. I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs. Make sure you order at least one size up.I am also disappointed with the customer service. Shipping took exactly 2 weeks. I do not think I would like to order another thing from Essential Apparel."
__label__1	Not true size: Went by the sizing chart and still did not fit right. Plus the way they explained the sizes really confused me. So maybe it was my fault, but I will be purchasing from someone who has the actual size I can understand.
__label__2	Simply Gorgeous!: These are simply gorgeous and they feel like a high end product, very high quality! Beautiful lace! I love these thigh highs hosiery!
__label__2	these are the least hideous stockings ever!: Hi. I ordered a whole selection of stockings from diverse makers, just in case, and these were the classiest as well as the most sheer. They don't cut into your upper thighs, they only have a hint of stick-um at the top, and so you really CAN clip them into garter belts--the whole point!The other stockings were thick, more sweaterish than silkish, and generally unsexy as well as hampered with that big fat band of stay-up rubber at the top. Ick. I plan to go back to this company and get a whole cross-section of colors.Oh, I also ordered one size up from what the size chart recommended for my wieght/size, that way they go higher on the leg than halfway, it's way sexier up nearer the top of your thigh.
__label__1	BBW: I loved the feel of the hose unfortunately the cotton lace top has no give and therefore is very uncomfortable and cuts into your thigh.
__label__1	Did not get what I ordered: I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size (A-B) than I ordered, I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted. I cannot tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received.
__label__2	"Poor Harry!!!!: This is one of the funniest books that I've encountered in some time. All Harry wants to do is take a little boat trip, maybe do some fishing, and relax. If page one is an indication of the things to come, it's not good news for Harry. We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going ""Mmmmmmmmmmm"". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up. A good number of titles out there can have the reader laughing on the first page but, can't deliver. This one does.Poor Harry!!!"
__label__1	"Not original hit versions, yet nowhere does jacket or CD say so: I've owned this CD for a few years, yet thought something was slightly off, so I compared ""Keep A Knockin"" to another copy I have.Results:Original is 168 beats per minutes, while this version is 172 beats per minute.Original's time is 2 min. 23 seconds; this version is 2:16 min."

It took me a long time to decide, and I'm glad this was my choice.......I liked it right off from the first time I saw it, and it handles wonderfully in the dishwasher as well.
__label__2	"thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening: I really enjoyed this book!I couldn't put it down after the first page which compares Marshall, ""An average North American Male"" ... ""plump and balding"", to his caged pet bird - ""Both had lived three fourths of their expected life span and had another fourth of life to go, if they were lucky"".This sets the tone for the novel which is a thought provoking story written with wit and intelligence.I should note, however, this is not and it is a book about the character Marshall Hollenzer. It is really a book about people - the choices they make and/or the fate bestowed upon them - and journeys - both physical and spiritual.This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening.I recommend buying at least two copies - this is the type of book that you will want to share with people you know."
__label__2	"You'll love Saint Martin!: Although it may be written as a ""child's book,"" any adult who reads this book should come to know, appreciate, and fall in love with St. Martin de Porres. I have recommended this version of his life's story to many people over the years. I love it."

However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)
__label__2	"Not as good as the first, but excellent!: The book CARIBES is the second in a series of six books by Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa. The first book being, CIENFUEGOS I, which was an exceptional book that I couldn't put down once I began reading it. The tradition follows with CARIBES, although not as exciting as the first book, this book continues to entertain and makes you laugh, as well as giving you factual knowledge about the discovery of the ""new world."" Highly recommended. I just wish that Amazon had all six books (cienfuegos, caribes, montenegro, azabeche, xaragua - and one more that I can't remember off hand)."
__label__1	Is Belva Plain kidding?: This book isn`t worth the paper it is written on!!It contained nothing of substance.Where did this couple live?What were their last names?What was a day like at home for the mother(Hyacynth)?What were her children like?What was important to her?These are just a few of the subjects not even touched upon by the author.I couldn`t get past the first 100 pages.I hav not read any of this authors other books since Evergreen,which I loved.This book was a waste of my time and money.I will not ever waste anymore money on this authors books.
__label__1	Unbelievable: I'll have to reserve a higher rating until I finish this saga. I think I will have to agree with the previous reviewer that gave a low rating. The dialog is so stilted I can't believe what I am reading. I AM a Belva Plain admirer, but her writing here leaves much to be desired.Back to this unbelievable couple and their disolving marriage.
__label__1	Not my kind of book: This is the first novel by Belva Plain I have read and I can say without hesitation it will be my last. I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.
__label__1	Too Slow: This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It is too slow. The author tends to drag on each situation. I think the plot is good it was just not well written at all. I am struggling to finish it just because I am curious to see what happens with the children.
__label__2	"After the Fire: I could hardly put ""After the Fire"" aside once I began reading it! I feel each emotion which Hyancinth feels - love, joy, anger, hurt, sadness, pain, shame, pride - as her life develops. How sad that this wonderfully talented woman is manipulated by almost everyone she encounters as well as by a horrible secret that is all consuming. This intelligent, attractive, talented woman is naieve, but also trusting. She is entrenched in negative situations and the grief process so many times, I wonder if she can become an emotionally stable, successful and proud person. As I learn to know and love Hyancinth, I know that she not only can but will endure all that comes her way and, most of all, that she is a survivor."
__label__2	"Belva Plain has done it again - another great story!: Once again, Belva Plain has written a compelling family storythat was hard to put down. I have read all of her novels and enjoyed""After the Fire"" immensely. The characters are interesting and believable; and the story combines both tragedy and happiness. A must read for her fans. You won't be disappointed."
__label__1	utterly unbelievable: Expecting a decent read, I was severely disappointed as I have read other Belva Plain books. The character of Hyacinth is totally unbelievable. How can a person live in this world and be so utterly ignorant of what real life is? The further I got into the story, the more incredulous and indignant I became. She allowed her husband to victimize her. Yes, he was despicable but she took it all. If this woman loved her children and wanted them with her as much as she claimed, she would have at least pursued some kind of second opinion, confidential consultation, something! And what about any true and lasting remorse expressed for the accidental death? She only expresses fear of spending time in jail. The woman exists in a complete cocoon. How sympathetic is that for a character? Spare yourself this book.
__label__1	Plain disappointed: I always read Belva Plain's new books since I have enjoyed her previous books very much. I found this book to be predictable from the onset. I looked at the front of the book twice to be sure I hadn't inadvertently grabbed a Danielle Steele book from the library shelves. The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative. I am certain that Belva Plain will return to her previous writing style with her next book(s)...please.
__label__2	Enjoyable: Gerald and Hyacinth appeared to have a perfect marriage, blessed with two beautiful children. However, when cracks appeared (or were the cracks there all along?), there was no stopping the swift breakdown of the marriage and the bitterness that came with it. Gerald had the upper hand in the divorce as he successfully blackmailed Hyacinth into letting him have the custody of both children. Pressured by Gerald, but unable to divulge the secret behind his blackmail to anyone, only when the mystery surrounding the fateful night was solved would Hyacinth be able to get on with her life.The plot was gripping. However, the impressive part was the way the emotional aspects in the book was handled. The sweetness of being in love, the tension between mother and daughter, the bitterness of a marriage breakdown, the pressure and burden of keeping a terrible secret, and the pain of losing loved ones were well-explored. Subtle, but intense at the same time.
__label__2	Mr & Mrs Who?: I am well into the book and am enjoying it as I am a fan of Belva Plain. However, no where so far do I find the last name of Hyacinth's family or Gerald's family. They are Dr & Mrs Gerald Who? Am I missing something or was this intentional on the part of the author?
__label__1	Defective: When I attempted to install the mirror onto my pickup, the three screws came unthreaded from the housing, which means that I cannot tighten the mirror to my pickup.
__label__1	The paint cover is flammable: Bought this set based on low price and good reviews. Works fine for poking logs occasionally and cleaning up when stove is cold, but while using the shovel in the fire, the black coating started bubbling, then caught fire.
__label__2	Gift for Son: This is the same set we have had for twenty five years. Its reasonably priced and I hope it lasts as long as our set has.
__label__1	Lousy workmanship: This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece.
__label__2	Just what I was looking for!: I was looking for a simple set of fireplace tools and this is just what I needed and fairly priced.
__label__1	it works as intended...: It does the job, yet most certainly strictly utilitarian. No frills. Not sure it will last long. Not in any manner decorative.
__label__1	Disappointing: I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend.
__label__1	Works: It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
__label__2	fireplace set: great product. my husband loves it. his old one was all rusted and well used, so i was very excited to find this one (especially for the price). nothing special, very basic, but works fine for in his manstand at the farm.
__label__1	did not like: This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around.
__label__1	Bad choice: This is by far the cheapest made fireplace tool set we've ever owned. It is flimsy and a 3 year old could hold it easily - by that I mean, it is so lightweight that it is actually difficult to use because it doesn't have enough backbone to do the job. If I hadn't already tossed the box, it would be returned. As it is, winter is almost over and as soon as we do the last fire, this item will be in the recycle bin. Very disappointed.
__label__1	broken: When the tool set arrived it was okay..smaller than I thought but mostly one of the tools was broken so it made the set not acceptable.
__label__2	About what I expected: It was about everything I expected because I read the reviews first. I wanted something that would be very inexpensive, but would serve the purpose. So far I have no complaints I have had several fires in my fireplace and it has served the purpose for which it was intended quite well.Each piece is a good weight in your hand, the stand is a little unstable but I just set it close to the hearth wall and its ok.Overall I am very happy especially for the price I paid for it.
__label__1	Disappointed: I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error.
__label__1	"Wrong Country for the product: Had to call the MFGR'er to be informaed that the model I was sent does not fit on any GOLF with US Specs,it was manufactured for the UK version of the Golf, which has less ""plumbing"" and emmission gadgetery.For my model, the only option is the replacement filter (square) that fits in the filter box."
__label__2	FUN FUN FUN!!: I would highly suggest this game to anyone who loves simulation management games. If you liked Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon, you'll love Virtual Resort: Spring Break.It has 11 or 12 levels in which you go through and fix several problems given a selected amount of time. It's a little rough but very addicting!! And in no time you're figure out what to do and be successful. With every level you complete you unlock that island to play in sandbox mode for later on.I give the game 5 stars for good graphics, fun play and ease of use!! Check it out!!
__label__2	Almost Perfect - I needs an expansion Pack!: This game would be one of the best of all time games if it had a map editor/creator and you could make your own larger maps AND if the buildings didn't need repair every hour. At first when you build them its not too bad, but once you get about 200 people, fixing every building every hour is EXTREMELY tedious!I absolutely LOVE this game other than that.I get to open a nice vacation spot and people always come, even before you're ready to have them they come... complain and leave, but they keep coming anyway! They are pretty easy to please once you build up a few essential buildings like bars, toilets and water rides.I hope Eidos didn't forget about such a fun game with so much potential! I would really love to see an expansion pack with islands I could create and more efficient buildings that don't break down everyday!I love this game and will play it forever :)
__label__2	An adult sim: I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment.
__label__1	Looks cool but....: This game looked great on the box and that is all I got out of it.Due yourself a favor and check to make sure your system can handle a game of this high speed and graphics.Called the game company waste of time then checked with my computer manufactor another waste of time.If you think you got a old system then stay away from this game unless your looking to waste a day trying to install and it will never happen.
__label__1	Spring Break - a lot of fun without the sunburn!: My favorite game was roller coaster tycoon, until this one came along. I downloaded the demo and bought the full game on the same day. Spring break is great fun.
__label__1	Not my type..: Pros and cons of the game...Pros:*Great plot,U have to become the best chef and beat the evil omni food empire.*Quite fun since u are able to join cooking competitions*U feel a sense of sastification when u watch people dine in ur restaurant.CONS:*GRaphics are a boo-boo,the graphics was blur*There aren't there many furniture to choose from unlike the sims.*VEry limited control-all u do is watch ur customers eat.At first,u will feell very sastified....but after a while u become very bored.U just wait for people to enter the restaurant and buy recipes from them.I really wouldn't recommend this game beacuse i had very limited control over the restaurant.....All i did was sit and watch the customers dine.....Now how much of a game is that?!I got sick and tired of it after two days of playing.
__label__2	Totally changed my perception of the Dragon: Not factual? How can someone say that! It was written by Linda Lee, Bruce's wife! How can it not be factual? I personally found this book very good. It is an easy read, and it is very informative. This book changed my perception of Bruce. Where I once saw a wonderful martial artist, which I still saw, I now see someone who was of profound mind and good heart. His intentions were great, his mind and philosophies greater, and his legacy shall live on forever. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!
__label__2	awesome: Awesome cd will be back to get more music great service great music to offer to people really good prices on music
__label__2	"Fall: A Brilliant Album that I proudly promote on my shows. I can play any track and loveeeeeee it. ""Average Joe"" is one that has my listeners asking for again. Going to start promoting ""She Loves it in the Morning"" as that is the single Clay has out. If you are looking for great country ""Fall"" is an album you should have in your collection."
__label__2	Happily, spookily imprisoned by the story: I read Sweet Dream Baby a few weeks ago, during a period of much stress & strife, and I loved it because I could get totally lost in it and in Travis' wonderful voice (also the great use of popular songs). I quickly ordered Sterling Watson's earlier book from Amazon, but was sorry to find no sequel that would allow me to see if and how Travis and the rest of his seemingly normal (at first), bizarre, sad family navigate the rest of their lives. Fun to read, beautifully written, thought-provoking, disturbing.
__label__2	It will become a part of you...: Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel.
__label__2	Unforgettable!: Sultry summer nights, passion, music, and a bit of mayhem... Sterling Watson's SWEET DREAM BABY is an unforgettable novel by a wonderful writer more people should know about. (What I want to know is, where is the sequel?)
__label__2	a great find: I won't spend time saying what has already been said so well by others. The reviews speak very well for this book and so they should. This book had me from page one and never let up. The only problem I had with this story was the age of Travis. I thought he was a little young for his character. I still give this book five stars and will read it again in the future. I also reccomend LAURA by Larry Watson and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW by Larry McMurtry
__label__2	couldn't put it down: I got this book from the library yesterday and read it cover to cover in 24 hours. It is a wonderful coming-of-age book dealing with loss of innocence, and brings back all the physical and emotional feelings that come with puberty. Family dysfunction is dealt with in typical '60's style -- no over-analyzing or self-pity was allowed then!
__label__2	SWEET DREAM BABY: Faux-Faulkner in Florida: SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story.
__label__2	Definitely worth reading: This book provides a great insight into the history and design of type, and quite a bit of the commentary is useful even today. Morison is well known, of course, for the Times New Roman face - and there is a section in the book on that face. But his commentary on the designing of faces like Plantin and Bembo is much more interesting, if you ask me. Also, if you are at all a fan of Eric Gill, you will like the section on Perpetua and Felicity. Anyone interested in the history of type should have this book, that much is certain.
__label__2	Great book!: This is a great book. I had a mortgage broker look at it and he thought it was a good program--the only drawback he saw to it was that it would take discipline. By the way don't pay $80 for this book from 3rd parties. Go to the author website[..]
__label__1	A verbose informercial: This entire book could be summed up in 10 pages. It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short. After reading numerous message boards on the subject, this book tought me nothing new. It really feels like an informercial that I paid for.
__label__2	Owning the American Dream: When I read Mr. Gill's book, for the first time ever, I realized it was possible to own my home before I'm old and grey! The book also opened my eyes to the advantages (think peace of mind) of having a strong equity base rather than being leveraged to the hilt and constantly panicked about my debt load. The book is clear, inspiring and a quick read. Above all it is informative. I feel I can now tackle my home loan and pay it off on my terms rather than the bank's. Boy does that feel empowering! I'm telling all my friends about this!
__label__1	Harlequin Romance in sheep's clothing: Pretty much just a business woman's Harlequin Romance.Sex scenes in a book cover you're not 100% embarrassed to be seen reading in public.
__label__1	Too blunt for me!: All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance.
__label__1	Wasted money: The subject is trivial and boring. The writing skill mediocre.I was stuck in Sri Lanka and downloaded it by mistake when learning how to use my new kindle. Decided to take a look.Sorry, perhaps just not my type of book. It is no literature.
__label__1	Too boring to finish: I got this as a free selection. It was so incredibly boring and I could not finish it. Don't waste any amount of money on it.
__label__1	Don't Bother: This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ...
__label__1	"Melissa's Eclectic Bookshelf Reviews: DNF Thoughts: I expected this to be a fun and quick read. And I just adore the simplicity of the cover...the two heart shaped cherries with their stems making another heart...so cute! Sadly I was just not able to connect with the story. It was just a bit too cheesy for my taste-a bit too unbelievable. I couldn't find much substance here. For an adult book it just seemed a bit juvenile for my taste. The characters did not act the way I would expect intelligent adults (as lawyers -they were supposed to be quite bright) even considering the fact that they were ""infected"" with this ridiculous disease. And the way the legal jargon was tossed into the dialogue. I know that the author was going for crazy and humorous here...but it just fell way short for me...too unrealistic.Note: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
__label__2	A Fun Read!: A quick, light-hearted read that kept my attention from beginning to end. Not the kind of book I usually read, although I'm glad I took the time to give this one a whirl. Definitely good for a few chuckles.
__label__2	amazing!: i loved this book! its undoubtedly a must read!! i need a sequel! im going to be forcing the library fo get this! it definitely deserves these 5 stars!
__label__2	Hot, funny romantic comedy!: I really enjoyed this new author! The hero and heroine seemed pretty evenly matched when it came to wits, and the sex was hot! Add in their jobs, a strange case with a dog, and medical mishaps, and I thought it was a funny riot! I was glad there was a HEA!
__label__1	Total Garbage!!: I got this book free for my Kindle. I have read a lot of free Kindle books and most of them are not that great, but they are at least a little entertaining. This is the first book I have deleted before finishing it. I read to 35% and just could not take any more! It was not funny at all, it was super annoying and predictable.
__label__2	Outrageously Funny: This book is laugh-out-loud funny, a great read and romantic enough to keep me turning the pages. I couldn't put it down!
__label__1	Boring: Maybe my expectations are too high but after reading the reviews I expected more. I thought the plot was too unrealistic for me to even be interested in. I liked the characters but I found myself flipping through pages just to get through the book.
__label__1	The writing is good, but the plot needs a lot of work.: I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there.
__label__2	A romantic comedy gem: Spunky with cheeky humour and wits, Trish Jensen's under-rated gem of a romantic comedy tells of two antagonizing attorneys, Paige Hart and Ross Bennett, who after a court session suffers a bomb blast and are hospitalized, diagnosed with Tibetan Concupiscence Virus that heightened sexual awareness. Their closed proximity forces them to deepen their understanding. Paige's large and comically larcenous extended family as well as a side romance between the doctor and Paige's brother provides first-rate entertainment while we are stuck with the oddball couple in their tension-filled and delightfully emotional romance. Trish Jensen delivers dimensional chracterization through punchy dialogues that are fresh, witty and funny.
__label__2	Interesting Story: Well the story was definitely not what I had expected. Very, very interesting and definitely not something I have read before or probably will read again. Very unique.
__label__1	stuck with you: I guess I downloaded this book by mistake. I got to chapter 6 and that's as far as I could take the unbelievable story. I could see nothing funny and I have a great sence of humor. I gave it a 1 star because there is nothing lower. Sorry, wish I could return the book, but it's been too long, just got around to reading it.
__label__2	Por Una Mujer Bonita: Pepe Aguilar, is one of a kind the way he sings makes one feel every word. The heart he puts into his music ( sentimiento ). I love his music, He is the WOW! for singers. Any song Ranchera, Balada, Banda. I have yet to hear a song that will not be done to excellence if he sings it. I Love Pepe.
__label__2	Excellent for beginners!: Very comprehensive, can get you up and running in 48 hours. A very thin book that contains the bare essentials as to familiarize yourself with MIDI and the initial steps to set up a working compilation of MIDI products. Explains concepts such as sequencers, samplers, MIDI-IN/OUT/THRU and countless more... the good part is that even though it holds great amounts of information, the book is orgenized in a way that is easily referenced in the future. It's easy... it's wonderful.
__label__1	Too old to matter: This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book.
__label__1	Somewhat outdated: This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then.
__label__2	Great for basic MIDI understanding and Setup: I am a student at musicians Institute in LA. I wanted to learn more about MIDI and bought this book.It has old pictures and couple sections are out of date. But if your are able to tell the difference between todays computers used in Music, you'll be fine>Great explanation. Very easy discription how MIDI messages are sent, how to use them and how to put together a MIDI System>All in all a great book. Helped me a lot
__label__2	"Beautiful!: The Oginski's style is very similar to the Chopin's. Well, they were both Polish and created in the same era. However I think I even prefer Oginski. I only wish that CD encluded the most famous Oginski's Polonaise: ""Farewell to the Fatherland"" (""Pozegnanie z Ojczyzna"")."
__label__1	"What was RITA thinking?: I was so disappointed in this book. Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat ""Lord Heartless"" for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book. Only a creepy feeling at the way society ended up treating the Duke."
__label__2	"The future of music.: If you are into experimental music then check out El Guapo's ""super/system"". This is experimental indie rock that is actually listenable and fun."
__label__1	Hmmm.: Well, I guess if you've never heard this kind of stuff before then it's fine, but it certainly is not the future of music. Listen to Papalotl instead.
__label__2	Great!: Great Door knocker. It has a very clean look to it and the peep hole isn't obvious. It's a little on the thin side but I guess you don't need much. It was easy to get engraved. It wasn't the easiest to install. Would have liked a template to assist with lining up the screws. Other than that, it looks very professional.
__label__2	Excelente!: Una excelente guía para todos aquellos que deseen concer más aobre el vino y su mundo. De forma amena y sencilla explica los principales conceptos y orienta sobre temas básicos como la elección del vino corecto, principales tipos de vino, cómo comprar vino en restaurantes o tiendas, etc.
__label__2	Well-written and thought-provoking: Although I read this book many years ago I recall that it is a well-written and engaging examination of women's sexuality. The difficulties that many young women face as they mature into fully functioning sexual adults - as mitigated by their upbringings as well as the varied expectations of society and their partners - are nicely illustrated through a series of real life case studies. The author, Dr. Bardon, was a teaching and research member of the faculty of the University of Minnesota from the early 1960s through the late 1990s. Some of the book will undoubtedly be dated, but much of it is just as relevant -...- today as when it was written in the mid 1970s. As used copies are readily available through Amazon.com I highly recommend picking one up.
__label__1	I wanted to love it, but...: I couldn't. The quality of this DVD is horrible! It was like watching an old old old VHS tape. I'm not surprised it was so cheap but I'm shocked that it was rated 4 and a half stars when I bought it. I was taken for a ride and it wasn't on the back of a horse.
__label__1	"very cheaply made: I just received this today and while I knew to expect nothing hand crafted, I was shocked at how amazingly flimsy this thing really is. The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have ""worked"" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere."
__label__2	Great gift: I bought this particular zen garden for my younger sister because she enjoyed the one I had so much. I love the tools that come with it. The only problem I had with mine was one of the small feet came off from the bottom. My younger sister was very happy to receive this, but hasn't said anything beyond that.
__label__2	Nice distraction: It's pretty nice and comes with a little book with interesting proverbs too. I'm not sure if it really helps to relieve stress but it's makes a fun distraction once in a while. The only complaint is when other people play around with it, they always spill sand out the box..
__label__1	Read the reviews first!: I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. I did not look at the reviews, and immediately regret it upon receiving my Zen garden. The other reviews summed it up nicely. The product is exactly what you pay for.Image:[...] - You can see the gap between the border/frame and the bottom piece. The tacks were put in, but did not hold the board to the border/frame. You should probably buy some wood glue, push lightly to separate the border, then press it back together with a small vice.
__label__1	Way too flimsy to be on your desk: There's a reason this thing is $15. It's made of ultra-cheap material and it shows from a mile. The stones look to be collected from around some highway. In addition to that, mine had an unbalanced stand which made it jiggle when playing with the sand. I returned it and will keep looking for something that is not an embarrassment when noticed by coworkers.
__label__2	A great deal!: I bought two of these; one for an office colleague and one for me. Everyone loves playing with it; they can't help but stop by my office and draw in the sand. It's pretty great for the value. I'm getting ready to buy another one for home.
__label__1	Cheap, and it shows: The product looks really nice when you open it. But when I took the zen garden out of the box, I discovered that two of the four feet had come off, and that the bottom was only attached to the sides in four places, at the corners. Along all four sides, it was bowed out with loads of space.I pushed it all together and glued the feet back on, but I'm keeping this in the bottom of the box it shipped in, lest I end up with fine white sand all over my desk. (I have this item at work.) When I leave the job or change work areas, I think I'll toss this rather than trying to bring it with me.Otherwise, it works as advertised. Really, it's hard not to, as it's sand and rocks in a tray. It's just hard to believe that a tray you put sand in could have been screwed up this way.
__label__2	Zen Garden: My Zen Garden came on time and exactly as described. I like it, but it really only is a tray with sand. Get this product if you want a nice Zen garden. If you want to have something to help you relax, get something else, there are better ways to cut loose.
__label__2	Happy with the product.: I received my zen garden yesterday, I really like it. For the price it is great quality. Also mine did not fall apart out of the box as others were saying. I was impressed with the packaging. For under $14 this is a great value. It is sitting on my desk at my office now.
__label__1	Soothing: Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.
__label__1	VERY DISAPPOINTED: I was very disappointed when product arrived. The bottom of box is very flimsy, it will not hold sand. This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. There is no way I am giving her this.
__label__1	very poor construction: For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen.
__label__2	Exactly what I was looking for: I was buying this as a gift and I was looking for a zen garden that was big enough to be a decorative piece for a table, but small enough for an end table. It was also a very good price. I was very happy with this purchase.
__label__2	Awesome for those who love the beach and sand!: It creates a calming atmosphere yet allows you to dream of the beach,the sand is a tad dusty though.
__label__1	poor quality: Disappointed in this item. The tray bottom was not attached well to the sides - doesn't hold the sand. Also, the rocks are dull and all one color. Rakes seem to be OK.
__label__1	for your own sake, do not buy!!!: When i got my package i openned it and everything was great, but the sand holder is so cheaply made, it was broken before i even touched it. Now i have to go through the hassle of finding the right one maybe at a home goods store.. and there is no way you can have a refund which i wanted, because they take off the sticker you use to send it back. I basically paid for sand rocks, and a cheap rake. Not worth the money! Made in china, the table is not stable at all. I hope nobody buys this, because they certainly dont deserve the money. Quality over quantity. -Rant over-
__label__1	Cheaply made: Like other reviewers, my zen garden arrived with the bottom falling apart. Had I tried to add the sand, it would have poured out the bottom. It was so visibly defective that I'm shocked that it made it out of the factory. I sent it back.
__label__1	Not so thrilled: The tray was thin and cheap looking and although it was supposed to have rocks included, there were none in the box. The only part of it that was half-way decent was the rakes. Because I was on a time constraint I kept it, but I did have to go buy rocks and I also bought more sand because what came with it looked like salt.
__label__1	"Terriable.: I can't believe I wasted my money on this! When I got the product, I had before-hand read some reviews about it falling apart or something. So, before I wasted the sand that came with it and caused a mess, I gently pressed on the wood/base part. It was flimsy, but I didn't think much of it. Then, while just doing a quick look over, I noticed that there was a small disconect between the bottom base and the black lining. This would cause the sand to leak out of the crack! Then, the base fell write off! I noticed that it had very tiny, small metal pieces that had wood from the base around it. I now realize that they probably put the metal into it, painted the top black, then pushed on the base to connect the two parts. The little ""stubs"" that hold it up have superglue stains from where they glued it to the bottom of the base. How cheap! I really don't know what to do now. I'll probably get my dad to put some nails in it. Really, the Dollar Tree would probably make a better structure!"
__label__1	Short good text, overwhelming background noise and old film.: These two short tapes consist of a brief description of 50 years of white-red relations, treaties and conflicts. Because of its brevity, there is little detail presented. The text is interesting and appears to be factually correct. The presentation is relatively unbiased, and is quite interesting. It would make a good audio tape. The extra loud background music and simulated battlefield noise sometimes drowns out the text. The visual portion consists of old photographs, presumably authentic in detail and clips from old grade B movies which are quite far from authentic. These are rerun from 6 to 10 times throughout the presentation and, of course, have no bearing on the text. Except for the extreme brevity and the overwhelming background noise, one can ignore the visual effects and derive a worthwhile understanding of many aspects of the period of the Indian Wars.
__label__1	"do not buy this piece of c--p: do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."

It is well written with enough detail to satisfy the curious, yet straightforward enough to allow for the average reader. Exceptionally informative book!
__label__1	Not happy with seller: I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain.

__label__2	Easy to install: I was looking for a shower door that could open from either the left or the right and I did not want one to choose for me. This door ticks and fits all the right boxes in that department. I like the crystal glass effect too. It is very clear and allows a lot of light into the shower hub. It is frameless too which is what was asked for by the wife.Its sturdy quarter of an inch thick glass also is a nice feature. But most of all the pivot door is a feature I got on with too.

__label__1	"Not a ""Bible"" by any means whatsoever: This book says it is a ""look"" and that what it is. By no means is it the Bible or even a beginner's guide to the 1911. Half the book is just gun reviews, which you can get anywhere. Another 1/4 or more has to do with competitions and things like that. If you want to learn about the ""use, care, and maintenance"" of the 1911, look elsewhere. The internet is better than this book."
__label__2	"READ the book . It is for all 1911 fans.: Read more than the table of contents! Some people have obviously rated this book without reading it. The Author explains why some guns are included in the test and others are left out (in 2 Places in the book). The author also talks about and praises his personal ""Colt"" 1911's. So you Rampant Pony fans should not feel left out. This book is obviously not ground breaking as there have been many books about the 1911, but it is very informative (gunsmithing, tactical course, competitions,& reloading). It provides an indepth comparison of the wide variety of the modern makes of the 1911."
__label__2	Outstanding information on the 1911!: This book is one of the most comprehensive books on the 1911. If you want to know anything about the 1911, this book (along with Vol. 2) is the best source of information.
__label__2	Gun Digest: The book was bought as a gift for my brother. He likes it and we were very pleased with speed of delivery and service.
__label__1	Flimsy materials, potentially dangerous item: Even though this is rated to hold up to 2000 lbs. I would not trust it to last very long. The nylon and ropes that this comes with are clearly very low quality. Some of the ropes even showed signs of fraying straight out of box. Cannot recommend this item.
__label__1	Wabash 1938: This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended.
__label__2	Very Nice Remote Contolled Tripod: I bought this tripod for video tapping an upcomming family wedding and have tried it a couple of times to get used to it. I like the the smooth operation of the controls on the handle. The panning operation is likewise acceptable. The telescopic locking legs work well, but are light weight and can rock a little during panning. The lightness is also a plus because it collapses into a small over the shoulder bag for easy toteing. One hand on the tripod for stabilization and one on the control handle during panning works well.
__label__2	Good for Sony Video Camera: This is an excellent tripod for Sony Video Camera. I am using this with my Sony Camcorder and remote is working pretty good. Its legs are strong. I am using the same with my Nikon D50( remote is not usable). And I am satisfied with the performance. only one issue is the base where you attach camera is plastic. So sometimes I am not comfortable with my DSLR with its zoom lens
__label__1	Don't buy from Antonline: We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there.
__label__2	Excellent product: I used this for taping while we were opening gifts for christmas. The remote features are great. This product makes video recording easy and fun.
__label__1	A padded short story disguised as a literary novel: The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve.
__label__1	Good basic story, but many flaws: I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing.
__label__2	"a page turner that leaves an impression on your heart: Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for ""friendship"".Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."
__label__2	An excellent book, please don't watch the film: Felicia's journey is an excellent novel. The background to both characters is well developed. Mr. Hilditch in particular becomes more sinister due to his overwhelmingly ordinary appearance. The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp. There are few convent girls left in Ireland who show such naivety. However she does grow more likeable, but not enough to demonstrate why she should affect Mr. Hilditch so much.
__label__1	All Language, No Heart: While I will readily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia's Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. The title character-a young, pregnant runaway searching for her baby's father-should have been one with whom you could sympathize. Instead, Trevor's love affair with language never quite manages to include his characters, leading to an unsatisfying reading experience. Couple the lack of emotion with a depressing ending, and you have a book best suited to gathering dust.
__label__2	A simple tool - but a real help!: Learning arabic on your own is a challenge. I chose to supplement the Kitaab fi tacallum al-arabiya series with MSA Vocab Clinic to get up to speed a little faster. It gives good pronounciation help, and the word lists makes bus rides a lot more fun...
__label__2	Good vocab review for intermediate learners: This is a nice tool for beginners and intermediate level learners of MSA, but if you've been studying for a while you will find this a bit frustrating. The 4000 words utilized are good, but they won't take you to the next level. The lists are good, but it would be nice to be able to make your own. A section of Arabic proverbs would be very useful as well, as knowing them makes a real difference when dealing with native speakers. I would pay $25 for this, but no more.

__label__1	"Don't like it: I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more."

__label__2	Is Germany the Future Sound of now?: Once again the Compost crew devestate with this collection that is sure to please those who refuse to be pigeonholed.

Sureshot selections include tracks by super inovator Phil Asher with his Restless Soul project, Austrian beatmeister Earthbound and footstomping mayhem from Japans U.F.O exclusive unreleased tracks! If you fancy yourself a conniseur of the outernational jazz dance scene then this is the soundtrack for you! Kinda like an audio edition of Wallpaper magazine if you can catch the vibe.
__label__2	"Excellent: My Trans-metropolitan counterpart beneath me definitely describes this cd well. I love the reference to Wallpaper, perhaps the greatest magazines ever (with Surface, Homme, and maybe Metropolitan Home) not far behind.But I digress... This cd, as with all of the releases in this series is excellent. Tosca's contribution is, of course, amazing. However, the entire width and breadth of this release is one that permanenty stays in the player.However, I would strongly urge you to seek out ""Volume Five"" of this series. It offers your senses two cd's of the finest Compost has to offer. I found it a local vendor, new, for an amazing price (under $15).A very, very worthwhile release...will not disappoint you."
__label__1	The worst of all the Future sounds of jazz series...: this all sounds crappy. fauna flash's drum n bass tune sounds so generic and boring that it makes everything else look bad. the tunes here are not of the same quality of other cds in the series like vol.5. i say skip this one, its really boring and with the exception of like one song by tosca everything else is $hit.

__label__2	"Lost Boy offers hope: This award winning documentary was brilliantly produced and directed. But more importantly, Greg's story is a true example of God's redeeming love, grace, healing and mercy. I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken, lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity, and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before, it is even more so now. When I go through difficult times, sometimes his story comes to me and I say, ""There is hope indeed. God will get me through this.This DVD is a powerful tool for evangelizing. Glory to God for His all consuming love that gives us such hope."
__label__2	Definitely fun, can be frustrating too (in a good way!): This is not a children's toy, obviously. It does, however, make a great gift with a nice bottle of wine to any puzzle-loving adult in your life. I bought it for my sister who found it a bit of a challenge to get the bottle out, but liked that she wasn't able to solve it easily either. It provided just enough challenge, then we enjoyed the newly freed wine. She has it displayed by her wine area and everyone needs to try it out when they come over for dinner. A good conversation piece!

__label__2	"Classic New Age Disc!: Wow, I'm surprised to see this available here. Horizont's ""Silent Moon"" is a classic New Age album from 1986. It was readily available for a few years, then totally disappeared; this disc is EXTREMELY hard to find now. This album is a good mix of new age and ""space jazz"". Most of the synths used here are now obsolete, and they sound great. The title track is definitely the outstanding track on the disc, but others are great as well. If you were to compare to other artists, it would be kind of like combining Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, and Dave Grusin (the more jazzy tracks are Grusin-esque). Overall a good listen and a great representation of the greatest era in new age music. Too bad the cover art is not available here, it's awesome. If I get a chance I will scan my copy and post it. Grab this while you can, you may not see it again for a long long time."

First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles.

__label__2	Easy, inexpensive peace of mind.: Takes more time to cut open the box than it does to plug in. Just plug it in, hold the test button, stick your fingers in your ears so you don't do deaf, and your all done. I've used First Alert products for many years, and they just work. They do wear out (5-7 years), but they will alert you when that time comes, usually with a chirping, like other detectors do.Simple, easy to use, no fuss peace of mind unit. Plug it in near air vents in bedrooms or just in open ares for non-living quarters and that's it!
__label__1	Broke after first day of use: Got hot and smelled like burning ozone after plugging in. A dissapointing product, never got any real use out of it. Do not recommend.
__label__2	Easy to use, trusted: After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house.
__label__2	Everyone needs one: These CO detectors are mandatory in many states now. I happen that the man who cleans my carpets is the Captain of the town fire dept (also up for promotion to chief), and he always points out my fire hazards or things I do or don't really need to do. I had my first CO detector up on the ceiling next to my smoke detector. He told me it di not need to be on the ceiling, and it's easier to get a plug in one so you don't have to worry about the battery aspect. Then incidentally my ceiling one broke somehow. So I bought this one, plugged it in, in the hallway near my bedroom......he said to do that so you can hear it quickly, and loudly. It's doing it's thing. A little pricey, but actually one of the cheaper ones. He approved!
__label__1	Burned outlet: I've had my unit for about a year. It was plugged into a wall outlet. Today I noticed that the unit was on the floor and that the outlet was scorched. The unit itself was burned around the prongs. There have been no power surges/outages, etc., so the only conclusion is that the unit itself is faulty. I'm grateful that it didn't start a house fire.
__label__1	Defective product: We bought this item twice. The first time, it was defective and wouldn't work (it made a dull sound all the time, and no additional sound at all when put in contact with water, as per the test described on the instructions sheet), so we returned it to Amazon (thanks for your excellent returns policy!) for an exchange. When the 2nd item proved just as defective, we got our money back. Don't waste your money on this junk -- buy something more expensive and substantial.
__label__2	very good product: Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks.
__label__2	Feel Safer Now: I was looking for a Carbon Monoxide alarm that was reasonabally priced, and was glad to find this one on Amazon.The reviews on Amazon were why I purchased this one. I tested the alarm, which works well, and hope I never actually need it!!Thanks Amazon for having it!
__label__2	co2 review: Rec'd co2 alarm 2 weeks ago. It seems to be working fine. Feel much better having this new alarm installed as our last one was no longer functioning.
__label__2	"Good product.: Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
__label__2	Does the Job: I just plugged it in and it's on the job. Perhaps it would be more assuring if it had a digital read-out of level of monooxide in the air.
__label__1	weird notification beeps: This went off in the middle of the night after my husband and I had had it for several years. We had to look up online the directions because it didn't have a clear beep for a warning and for a battery replacement. It was ridiculous. I would not recommend it. I want one that clearly tells me when to vacate the house and call the fire department.
__label__1	My bad, but theirs too: It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. However, what the?? I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up. This one has to go back.
__label__1	"Don't Bother: I would not recommend this product. When I plugged it in, it would not stop chirping. The directions said it might chirp ""a few times"" while powering up, but the thing chirped all day. Also, the 9 volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment. The company that I bought it from told me to just throw it away, although I did receive a full refund."
__label__2	"No Brainer!: I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."
__label__2	Carbon Monoxide Alarm: I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area.
__label__2	does what it's supposed to do: easy set up, working great - no complaints to far. it was nice to find one so cheap! we'll see how long it lasts...
__label__1	WARNING: This is not an instructional video!!: I bought this video from Lullabot as soon as it was released. I've managed several Drupal projects and am now diving in to development myself. I was very disappointed, this video has no instructional content whatsoever. It is a very (very) high level view of what Drupal is. I give it two stars for good production value, only.I am hoping this is the first in a series of videos that will dive deeper into Drupal.
__label__1	tripod sony: This tripod is out of production, although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170, was the only model with a reasonable price. The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder, too light, not enough hight, and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough, you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts. The only advantage is the remote controller and the price. I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price.
__label__1	Cheap along with poor customer service: I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!
__label__2	The truth: This book will take you to another uncomfortable space where your believes and ideas of spirituality will change. Change is necessary if you want to know.
__label__1	False: I have read alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this book is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff.His other works are consistant and valuable, among the most valuable words ever written,This book has less wisdom than the average person on the street
__label__1	Don't buy this: Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). For a scholar this book gives a look into K's mind as a youngster but it doesn't portray the important elements of his teachings which flourished after around 1933.
__label__2	Pretty Straight-Forward: This was one of the very first things I crocheted. The gusset was a little confusing until I realized the gusset illustration was in the beginning of the booklet. My socks came out great and my mom is already asking for a second pair, so I'll probably try a different style.
__label__1	"Ordered 2; Both Chains Were Tarnished and Pendants Scratched!: I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother. Both arrived with very badly tarnished chains (about half the chain rust colored on both). In addition, the actual pendants were scratched and ""used looking""."
__label__1	OMG! this Movie is too wierd to be watched sober.: I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?
__label__1	ho hum: If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore.
__label__1	"Waste of time.: I bought this video while thinking to myself, ""hot chicks beating the crap out of each other, sweet"". Well, none of these things turned out to be the case. The chicks aren't hot, in fact one either used to be a man, or still is a man. The violence is limp to say the least. Imagine an episode of cops where neighbors at the trailer park are in a domestic disturbance. The problem is that the girls aren't athletes, nor do they seem to care much if they win. Stay away, this is just some dude with a camcorder attempting to get you to part with your money."
__label__2	High Quality Hot Beverage Holder: These cups are easy to clean and drink from. the color is excellent.A worthy addition to your home.
__label__2	Great story but a little tedious in places: My mother had read another Dorothy Canfield Fisher novel as a girl and loved it. When I found this, I bought it for us both. It's a very interesting story, but I find Ms. Fisher's style to be somewhat pedantic and tedious. Her syntax is of another age, and it makes reading the book rather time consuming. I like the characters and the plot, however, and am eager to see how things turn out for Sylvia and her family. I would recommend the book only to those who like old-fashioned stories and who know something of Ms. Fisher's educational philosophy. The casual reader may not have the patience to wade through it.
__label__2	"Creative and Inspiring: I loved this book, but when I got ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"" I was surprised to find ""Making Journals by Hand"" is actually included in that text in full: word for word, page for page, project for project .Instead of buying ""Making Journals by Hand"" and ""Making Memory Boxes"", save some money and buy one book: ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"". This book combines all of the projects above and then some.All of these books have great projects and instructions."
__label__2	"Way Cool Ideas!: A beautiful book. I love everything about it: crisp photography, nice paper, great ideas, an abundance of inspiring bon mots, lots of resources listed at the back of the book. After flipping through its pages, I wanted to jump off the sofa and begin journaling! But I didn't. I felt a little overwhelmed by the creative journal pages I saw. I just don't know where people get some of their amazing ideas. I wish my mind were half as fertile as those whose works are featured in the pages of ""Making Journals by Hand."" I will, however, continue enjoying the visual feast between its covers and hope for a divine intervention that will get me off the sofa and into the craft room to create a fabulous rememberance, just as the featured artists have done. If you like books, paper, art, rubber stamping, writing, color, cool ideas, and peeking into other people's journals, buy this book."
__label__1	"Skimps on Content: While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn't look like the author put a lot of effort into explaining them. It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on ""themes"" describes a travel journal's purpose as ""chronicling your travels""...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book. Flip through this book in the library to get some good ideas, but don't expect thoughtful written advice."
__label__1	"Doesn't live up to title: While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
__label__1	journal making?: I bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics.
__label__2	Radiator replacement: The radiator cost half of what it cost at parts stores.So far no leaks except a rubber stopper they use was thin,cracked and leaked.I had a feeling it would so I carried a spare $1.00.I do recomend this product anyway.The shipping was prompt,with no hassles.
__label__1	Failed after 6 months: Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.
__label__1	For collectors only!: This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna's first album. Definately only for those who can't stand not having any given Madonna cd for their expansive collection.
__label__1	Not my type of book: I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book.
__label__2	EXCELENT PERFECT FABULOS SUPER: I loved this book! I read the first Egerton hall book, the Tower room when i was bored one day and i couldn't but then down untill i read this one. Bella is just me I love her and the ending is sooo Sweet BUY BORROW OR STEAL THIS BOOK,AND THE TOWER ROOM AND WATCHING THE ROSES AS THEY ARE MUST READ
__label__1	"Jerry Lewis' Worst Movie: I admit I gave up on this movie after about 50 minutes. But up to that point the whole ""comedy"" revolved around Dean Martin bullying and shouting at Jerry Lewis, for no obvious reason. I am a life-long Jerry Lewis fan, I adore many of his movies, but not this one. It is pointless tripe. I never thought I'd give up on a Jerry Lewis movie, without watching it all the way through. But after 50 minutes, I felt like shouting back at Dean Martin for his odious carry on in this film. Whoever wrote the script doesn't know the first thing about humour. What a tedious movie!!!!"
__label__2	I love it!: I love this movie!To see Jerry in a dress is always funny.Skinny and hairy!What a riot!!!He's a very handsome man,but he makes a funny looking laaaaaadddddyyyyyy!!!It's worth watching.
__label__1	At War With the Army rating: I disliked this DVD because close to the end of the movie it was all defected or scratched up and I did not get to see the end of the movie. I mean it was Jerry Lewis, so I know there were some good laughs at the end. So disappointed.
__label__1	Same old junky print!: Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. Sadly it is not. It is taken from the same horrible print. Decent movie, but baaaaad quality. Let the buyer beware! This is the item I bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YVX9/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
__label__2	I love the young Jerry.: Jerry has such a humble approach in his character it is very easy to sink in. There is never a dull moment when he comes onto screen. I love his B&W's.
__label__2	old time magic: this is a old movie that shows how they did it years ago you can get lost in it and enjoy it verry funny a must see
__label__1	Good Times Video...Skip it: What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version.
__label__1	"Dean and Jerry on a Low Budget: The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."
__label__1	"Hmmmmmm...: I guess I didn't find this CD memorable, as I couldn't even remember what it sounded like. There were no particular pieces that jumped out at me and cried ""Dance to me."" Overall I was not that impressed."
__label__1	Complete piece of junk: Had one of these when I was a kid, it was fun so I bought one as a gift for my son. The rocke didn't mate correctly with the pump but we tried gamely to hold it in place and pumped it a few times, at which point the valve on the pump separated from the body. There was virtually no force being applied to this part of the pump, it was a press fit piece that couldn't possibly withstood any real pressure from the pump. It was a total joke, this is not a complicated piece of equipment, it was never built to do anything other than to dupe the consumer.
__label__1	JUNK! (says China on product): When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same.
__label__1	don't waste your money: I had several of these as a kid and never had a problem. This one was defective out of the box! When i tried to put the rocket on the pump and lock it in place the air pump nipple snapped off and rendered the toy useless. After further inspection i found that the rocket itself was the cause. The plastic ring at the base that attaches to the pump was deformed and would not mount on the pump properly, when i slid the pump lock over the mount it started to bind and snapped the nipple off.I packaged it up and returned it.I may try some of the other models to see how they stack up.
__label__1	Can't get it to work: I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago...
__label__1	Broke immediately: It's hard to write a full 20 words on a toy that broke on the very first use leaving me with a cheap piece of plastic and a crying five year old.
__label__1	disappointed: Don't Waste your money the pump to pressurize the rocket broke after first and only use. Very disappointed bought this for my brothers children because he used to have one as a kid and he loved it so I bought this one and it broke on the first try.
__label__1	Memory Lane??: I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!
__label__1	Ron: Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy.
__label__1	Completely worthless: I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves rockets and I thought she would enjoy it. The pump is total junk and could not even pump enough pressure for a single flight before it broke. I spent an hour trying to fix it and the highest I've gotten the rocket to launch is a couple feet! This resulted in my daughter crying and the rocket getting thrown away. Do not buy this one!
__label__1	Old School Rocket: Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.
__label__1	Junk: Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not.
__label__1	This toy is JUNK!: I ordered two of these for my kids. The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping. There is a trigger to lock in the rocket while pumping but the trigger is in the way of holding the pump and is unsafe because a simple bump makes the rocket launch accidentally. The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets. The rocket's highest flight was about 10 feet becuase the pumps were so lame.
__label__2	Great Video on Holistic Medicine: My husband is an ND and an African Traditional Healer so I bought him this video for his birthday. He enjoyed it, for me it was a little long and mundane I thought it was more on spirituality. Yet and still, the birthday man was very happy. Anyone in the healing or medical field will enjoy the DVD. It does talk scientifically about how and why the herbs work. I learned new ideas about Tibetan Healing Techniques that are similar to African Traditional Healing. That was helpful for me because I do all the writing for his company and it gave me a new perspective.In conclusion if your interest is in the field this video is helpful.
__label__2	Good showing of Tibetian medicine: My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet.
__label__1	not what I thought it should be: I missed a lot of the subcaptions but I think I may have understood the meaning of the file. May like it more in english.
__label__1	Don't bother.: Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English.
__label__2	Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine: ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer.
__label__2	"Think for your self!: ""If people let government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny.""- Thomas Jefferson"
__label__2	THE KNOWLEDGE OF HEALING: A GOOD VIDEO BUT IT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT I COULD USE WITH MY CLIENTS.A HELPFUL OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE
__label__2	Enlightening: Must have movie,Must have, inspiring, enlightening, eye opening, good, heart felt enlightening, must have in your own library, movie to keep and give
__label__2	Perfect for post-surgery footwear: I recently had surgery on my ankle after breaking it pretty badly & needed to find socks to wear under my brace (aircast boot). My doc said I could just wear my own socks, but my own socks are way too tight to comfortably wear with my swollen foot & ankle. I found these & they're perfect to comfortably fit without putting any pressure on my incredibly sensitive foot. The only con would be the price - not sure why it's so expensive to make what are basically incredibly lightweight mesh socks (they do have extra padding on the feet, but they're still very light/thin socks). But ultimately, they're worth the price for me (so much so I'm buying a second pair).
__label__1	"Not great: I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee. They only go about 4"" above the ankle. Very wimpy, probably wouldn't hold up to too many washes."
__label__2	I've never felt better!: Bringing Yoga to the office is the object of this neat, compact workbook, Desktop Yoga. If you've got five minutes in your day to devote to Lusk's simple and effective exercises, your work day will seem like less of a burden. Great for relieving stress! A must-have!
__label__2	This is a God-send: This is a wonderful resource that helps me get through every day at work. My headaches and neckaches are better since I started using the yoga stretches and breathing techniques. It has taught me how to powernap to revive me from feeling exhausted, and has given me lots of tips on how to cope with change, handle stress, and enjoy life more. A lot of helpful information is packed into the useful book. Thank you very much.
__label__2	Excellent book, especially for working people: Provides many yoga-based stretching exercises that are great for people who spend a lot of time working at a desk or some other sort of sedentary occupation.
__label__1	"NOT WORTH THE MONEY: This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
__label__1	"Come on.............: We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
__label__1	"Unbeliavable....: So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
__label__2	cheaper on overstock: I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year.
__label__1	Manufacturer does not honor their warranty: It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. However, in less than five years of ownership I noticed the topper lost a considerable amount of firmness. It became too soft to sleep on except for the edges and I found myself waking up less refreshed. It's like trying to sleep on a 'V' shaped mattress.I contacted the manufacturer, Foamex, twice via email but they never responded. Finally I called and was told they won't service the mattress; redirecting me back to the seller who has since gone out of business. I have no experience with this seller, however I would suggest anyone considering purchasing a Sensus brand viscoelastic mattress or topper be aware that you will likely have problems before the ten-year warranty has expired. Plus, even if you find a seller who doesn't turn a warranty claim into a hassle, you will find they are rather expensive to repackage and ship. I will not purchase another Sensus or Reflex brand product.
__label__2	This is not a review.: This is not a review, it's a rave. This is not some piece of self-conscious, tricked out, contempo ironic (the knowing wink in the voice), cooler than thou vocabulary popcorn or breathy lil grrl prom panic whine. This is real music. The full range of expression. It will move you. Watch out.

__label__1	Enough with the Adult Conspiracy!: The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.
__label__2	book: received used book purchase 1 day early, very happy about that. book was in great shape. book purchased for gift and recipient was very happy with it.
__label__2	Enjoyable novel: This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars.
__label__2	Another Excellent Achievment: This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book.
__label__1	"Zombie Lover or Sex,Sex,Sex: This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite ""white girl"" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book."
__label__2	smelly pens: My kids love these pens. They last and last.I had a set from the late 1970's and I could still color with them.This was our 2nd set for the kids and deffinately will purchase again.
__label__2	Compact and Convenient: Works great and compact and convenient. The detachable lanyard is nice for when I don't want to carry my pack with me. I don't see myself using the white and black cards too often, but they're nice to have. The cards are of a nice quality, thick enough to not bend accidentally when in the camera bag.
__label__2	Great color, small size: I take photos of antique prints for sale in a controlled condition (photo lights, etc), making correct color of utmost importance. The card is small to set the white balance on my camera, but works wonderfully with Adobe Lightroom to set the custom white balance. I am new to photography, but have found that this combination is working well for me.
__label__1	"An Inferior Copy of a Great Product: I think this is my first review in the years I've been on Amazon, but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product.I bought both the DGK and theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")and I have to say that the WhiBal just feels better and feels that it will last a lot longer(the DGK cards are only about the third of the thickness of a WhiBal). However the Digital Grey Kard has one thing going for it, it has a superior laynard.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and get theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")instead."
__label__2	"Works Great-short comings yes but--: As a retired negative wedding photographer, I want spot-on results. But with the digital age I had trouble getting exposure/white balance correct. Yes, the processor could correct for my ""slight"" errors. I did not appreciate how important white balance was, nor that it can change as easy as exposure. After a couple of tests w/this card. I was amazed at the skin tones I got. I used a drug store type quality (Costco) for convenience & speed and got great exposures! Just think what a higher quality firm (i.e. Dale Labs) can do with my files!Photo correction programs: Just use the ""eye-dropper"" tool; get color corrections- presto!Short comings: The cards could be larger! The instructions could be more detailed- The makers of this product could benefit from comments here!"
__label__2	Great Movie: Bought this item for my son and he loves it!!! I ordered it for Christmas and was a little worried it wouldn't make it to my house in time, but to my surprise it arrived very quickly!!
__label__1	dissapointment: If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows.
__label__1	"Earland below average: This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Standard tunes like ""Unforgetable"" and ""Europe"" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on ""Sheila"" and ""Kicker"", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote"
__label__2	Great Fun Album: They are at a party playing mostly acoustic guitars and bongo drums. They sing some Beatles tunes as well as their own. They have allot of fun on this and it's an unusual album.It says instrumental but they do sing and they sing acapella's too that's where the other tracks are. There are 2 different albums and one does have 20+ tracks
__label__2	good for accompanying: I bought this CD originally when I was in junior high, to accompany me while I practiced my saxophone (I preferred to practice to Beach Boys music over the school fight song). Anyway, it's also good for karaoke. However, be careful listening to the previous reviewer, who either can't count or has a different CD. There are 15 tracks on the CD, which last I checked is *not* over 20.
__label__2	Dysfunctional Funeral: While many families don't get along for one reason or another... Sometimes it takes a miracle to make people look at their own lives a bit closer... in this film.. mainly a comedy with some twist... you might relate to dealing with a whole family coming together for a mothers funeral.You may check out the trailer here as long as Youtube has it available[...]
__label__1	"Chinese American Film at its worst: This is the worst film I have ever seen made by and about Chinese Americans. It may be of interest to people of mixed Asian ancestry since most of the cast is of mixed race. The premise may have been taken from an episode of ... Little House on the Prairie(!) wherein Charles helps a woman fake her own funeral to bring her ""distant"" kids home to see her."
__label__1	BIG THUMBS DOWN: I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
__label__2	Shake Shake Shake: Great Gift Great Value - I had to get one for myself. The glasses are over sized and the shaker stirs up a great batch of dry Martini's. I love the retro glass look and the shaker has a seal to prevent leaking while shaking your favorite drink.
__label__2	good martini set: glasses are awesome. They look great and they are larger than your average martini glasses. All my friends loved the glasses when I had a martini party.The shaker looks great, but alas, it leaks all over your hands when shaken, despite having a seal. So be careful!!But for this price, it's still a great buy.
__label__1	Aesthetically pleasing but not functional: While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set.
__label__2	Very Nice: I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky.
__label__1	Beware: The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again.
__label__1	A booklet- not a textbook!: At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!
__label__2	art book: I was happy with the book on how to draw but it is for an older child. I'm sure our granddaughter will be able to do the drawing, just not the reading. We will need to help her.
__label__1	Not for Metal!: Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for.One punch through soft 26ga copper sheet and the edges of the punch bent & in some areas, flaked off. The second disk I cut did it in completely. I had to file all of the edges and it probably would have been easier to cut the sheet with shears.So, not for metals.However, I can see it would be great for leather, paper & plastics.To me it was worth the money spent on the chance that it would actually cut metal disks.
__label__1	Not good!: I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
__label__2	Awesome!: Just what I needed. Worked like a charm. Loved the various sizes. I suggest using an x-acto cutting mat underneath the leather. It'll get destroyed but it gives you a nice clean cut.
__label__1	BEWARE OF SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN!: I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to. But it has a serious safety flaw/problem!!:The kit came with no instructions, so I was figuring out how it worked, and as I was turning the screw on the side of the barrel, the sharp pointed 2 inch pin needle inside the barrel shot out like a projectile dart. It was spring loaded and the screw is what held it in.Luckily it wasnt aimed at myself or anyone, because it could have caused serious injury. After the pin shot out I was left feeling very disturbed that this tool could have taken out my eye out.So, I feel compelled to warn and advise others who might be buying this tool set.
__label__1	West Coast Avant Garde: Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have. This is way to modern for me, I like cool west coast jazz, but this is sort of Ornette Coleman meets Karlheinz Stockhausen--very modern in tone. If that is your bag, the album is for you, otherwise pass this one by.
__label__2	"Listen Compute Rock Home: I received this record as a gift and have listened to it over and over with my friends at school. Many of the items are great for kids, but my friends and I love the psychedelic music and sound effects. My current favorite is ""Army Ants in Your Pants""...very imaginative!"
__label__1	"wonder woman costume: This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. BEWARE! Very cheap material! The sizes are different from what it reads online, and the pieces of the costume are different sizes. For example: the skirt is waaaay too small but the pullover ""boots"" fit just fine. As all the other reviews claim, the outfits ""color/graphics"" peeled off because it was stuck to the plastic package. I do not recommend this unless they are only using it for dress up."
__label__2	pretty good: Got this through Amazon for my daughter's superhero party. She could hardly wait to put it on. The quality is OK - some parts (like the skirt) have gotten stuck together and the color has come off a bit. For a costume though, it'll serve a good purpose, and provide hours of fun. The boots a really high. My daughter is tall for her age, but the boots go all the way up (and even under) the skirt. Just FYI.
__label__2	Engulfing , tremendous makes you feel like you were there: This book is totally engulfing from page one .It puts thereader inside the fall of a great empire . It really makesyou feel as if though you were there . And it also gives youso much knowledge , that you could talk about it as if thoughwere there . A definite must read for anyone interested inhistory , and for those who are not also . Because it is agreatly written story about the most important event in thiscentury
__label__1	Printing is WAY too small!: Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again.
__label__1	"Lenin's Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire: this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word ""ramify""? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."
__label__2	Fascinating tour of the times leading up to and after the fall of the Soviet Union: This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. It maps the mindset and events during this dramatic change. It is told with a direct, personal style that I found gripping, and that gives a very good sense of the societal changes and impacts. I highly recommend it.
__label__1	Huge & Unreliable: I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !
__label__1	Broke within the first week: I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product.
__label__2	This thing is huge: I got this for my 800+ page unbound textbook, and it could easily hold at least 300 pages more. The only problem with it is, because of the size, you cannot put it into a backpack with room for anything else. I ended up having to get a smaller 2-inch binder and put a few chapters at a time in it for easier transportation.
__label__2	Great Find: After long search for translation of Montale's poems, this bilingual edition was perfect. Book was in perfect condition and arrived at exactly the announced date.
__label__1	very bad movie/DVD quality: I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality.
__label__1	"Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
__label__1	Come on is this Real??: You figure zombie movies have been out for at least 20 years and to this date we still can't produce a low budget zombie movie with better actors. The dialogue was good the presentation sucked. it was like they were reading the dialogue instead of experiencing it. The plot was good as well. This movie had all the elements of a well made zombie flick but no one was chomped only the token Lesbian Black chick. Good try but I wanted more.
__label__1	Uhhh.: I can not be certain but I don't think the other reviewers and I saw the same movie. Acting was terrible video was terrible plot was terrible. Good try I guess.
__label__2	More Z's Please!: This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.
__label__1	not very good: i don't remember this movie, so i know it was bad. i probably did not watch the whole thing. bad production, bad acting
__label__1	This was a waste of time.: Let's keep this simple: promising plot ruined by -Bad acting.Poor and often ignorant dialogue (scripting).Inconsistent plot elements (slow walking zombies, then fast ones, then back to slow).An inhabited island overrun by zombies, yet not a SINGLE boat was available anywhere.Piss poor directing.What else is there left to say?
__label__1	The Worst!: I'm not sure what zombie movies the other reviewers have watched but I find it hard to believe they actually liked this one. I feel like I was tricked into paying for this based on the reviews. The acting sucks. The set design sucks. The effects suck. What I'm trying to say is that this movie sucks.
__label__1	dont waste your time or money.: lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
__label__1	The DVD has missing segments!: In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs.
__label__2	The belt was not included: When I finally gave the costumes to the kids I noticed that the one custome of Batgirl was not complete. The belt was missing.
__label__2	My 7 year old daughter loved being batgirl...: The costume was perfect for my daughter and the best part is the costume came with every thing you need to be a very adorable batgirl. The quality was good as well.
__label__1	Poor quailty: Item sizing was not consistent. Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit. Cheap and torn before could even use it.
__label__2	My daughter liked it: While I am not a big fan of this costume, my four year old liked it and that's all that matters. She wore it almost every day before Halloween and she felt so proud to say to others she was going to be a super hero for Halloween. She definitely has enjoyed it, the price was great so I am happy with this purchase.
__label__1	ok: This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!
__label__1	not too durable.: This was great as a Halloween Costume. however, after my daughter tried it on, one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight. Good for a one time use. My daughter enjoyed it.
__label__2	Too bad it did not bring the Mask: My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask. I inquired the seller and they confirmed there was a confusion : the description of the Costume did not include a mask , I replied even I did not notice it in the description, the picture showed the girl with the mask and there was no clarification about it. I think they should have made a clarification, it seems to me it is false publicity. It is good to know they have updated the picture.
__label__2	Batgirl was a Christmas hit!: My 3 year-old niece loves to dress up, so we got her this costume for Christmas. She loved it and spent the rest of Christmas vacation wearing it.
__label__1	Missing main dress, belt and cloak!!!: I received the package with missing main dress, belt and cloak (I received only the mask, gauntlets and shoes cover)I'm an oversea customer and it will be very costly for me to return this item as already I paid the shipment fees to get this item.I sent them an e-mail on 1/11/2013 requesting to send me the missing items , BUT, they didn't respond till now!!!
__label__2	"Good for the price: My daughter loved the styling, loves being a ""super hero."" We got this on discount on the offseason, so it was an extremely good buy."
__label__1	Cape is very small/ fabric is very thin: The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. The mask didn't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating. The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it isn't that big at all. Also the velcro that holds the cape on didn't even hold up on Halloween night. Disappointing
__label__2	Fabulous: The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them.
__label__1	Expect what you pay for: The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. Also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new.
__label__1	Wouldnt buy it again!: I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying.
__label__1	Wouldn't recommend: The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume.
__label__2	Great Costume!: This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money.
__label__1	Too small and stained: I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged.
__label__1	Bad thing: The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected.
__label__1	poor: Was missing the belt for one thing was to small had to order another one just so she could use it they need to put the correct size on the item we ordered a 5-6 got ot and the item said fits size 4-5
__label__1	No belt!!!: My costume was a small and didn't fit my 5 year old wayyyy to tight and it dd t come with the belt!!!
__label__2	Awesome Costume: This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.
__label__2	cute costume: cute costume but make sure you get all the pieces im missing the belt and i already threw the packaging away and i didnt even notice the belt was missing :(
__label__2	She loves it: Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it.
__label__2	like this on the best: I have purchased many bevel tools and I like this one because it goes further down into thehole and the shape feels better to my hand especially when working out a lot of thumb holesused this product a lot and haven't had to sharpen it yet.
__label__2	"Lush ""Masquerade"", enegetic Gayne &Spartacus: My title says it all. Love this CD. Khachaturian is a great, great Artist and he always thrills and touches you. You'll love this one."
__label__2	Umbra 24-inch tension rod: I am pleased with the rod as it fit the small shower enclosure. It did fall only once after I put it up, but I retightened it and it's remained in place ever since. Excellent value for the dollar
__label__2	"great!: I bought this for a narrow entry tiled shower. It was very hard to find a tension bar that would work for my 26"" shower opening - not to mention I wanted a nickel or chrome finish. The bar fits snugly, but is not as heavy as I had hoped. It hold a thin shower curtain very well, but would not hold up to a heavier curtain. Perfect for my use/"
__label__1	"THIS IS NOT A SHOWER CURTAIN ROD: I searched Amazon for ""shower curtain rod, nickel"" and this product is returned in the results. From the image, it looks just like other shower curtain rods sold on Amazon; however, this rod is only about 1/2 inch in diameter and will not work as a shower curtain rod. Don't be fooled like I was."
__label__1	"thin: The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2"") rod. When exteneded to near its mazimum length it becomes very flimsy and will barely hold my small shower curtain without bowing in the middle. I would have expected a little better for the price and the intended use. But, it works and it's black."
__label__1	Item was nice color: This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin.
__label__1	Disappointing: The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!
__label__1	Not good for showers: Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows.
__label__2	Nice Tension Rod: It might not be the strongest but so far it has done it's job very well. It looks very nice and I am pleased. Just make sure that you dont leave it loose or it will fall on your head. Overall a nice product for the price.
__label__1	Too Small for a Shower Curtain: This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it.
__label__1	Pretty, but not functional: This curtain rod looks nice, but can barely hold any weight. It will only work with sheers.
__label__1	"Poor Quality: This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
__label__2	Umbra tension rod: I am pleased with my Umbra tension rod. I needed a rod with no hardware, because my new house has concrete block walls and deep window wells. This tension rod fits the bill and is a very attractive too.
__label__1	"Shower Curtain Rod Review: Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
__label__2	Julia Child at her absolute best!!!!: This is my absolute favorite cooking series on PBS. Julia Child in her own home kitchen, with some of the greatest chefs working today. Her warmth and quirky humor shines throughout, and she has a lovely rapport with many of the guests. She is genuinely enthusiastic about the baked goods, and her baker-guests are obviously thrilled to be cooking side-by-side with Julia. Truly entertaining, even if you never make any of the recipes yourself! I only wish that they would make a box-set of the entire series!!
__label__1	This DVD is not as represented in the description.: There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.
__label__1	Sent damaged product: I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned.
__label__2	A National Treasure: Julia Child was just the best! The entire food world, as we now know it, owe it all to her. Watching this as well as any other of her shows, particularly her first shows, are exciting, enlightening, educational! She is missed & will always be the best!!!
__label__1	Shoddy Disks: The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job.
__label__1	Longevity: I was initially impressed with the company and the product. The company ended up to be local which was a plus. The product didn't last a year and I purchased two of them. Both failed inside of a year.
__label__2	One of the best albums I've heard in years: This is a front to back cd which is a rarity. Kershaw puts together intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics with layered music that always has a lot going on.His creativity in terms of sounds that he comes up with is incredible. One can hear a little radiohead influence on this album.His transition from 80's alterna-pop to his now contemporary 90's acoustic-based sound seems so natural and is actually an improvement on his earlier stuff. I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.
__label__2	Nik in the 2000's: I remember him in the 80's. I found some new tracks of his on youtube. Those tracks grew on me and I bought the CD. It's true, just about every song is great.Slower pace and slightly more acoustic than his 80's work. The songs are more from his heart, which is where every good song comes from.It's that type of album.
__label__2	"At LEAST 15 minutes of listening pleasure!: This is what I listen to when I'm in my Adult Contemporary mood. (Well it's Kershaw more often than it is Springsteen) I've heard of all Nik's old 80's albums, and this really makes them sound bad. I mean, of course, songs such as ""The Riddle"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" are better than anything on earth, but this new material is consistently impressive.""Billy"" is instantly likeable, while songs like ""Shine On"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are the slower favourites. ""God Bless"" is the only stinker, while every other song entertains us with cool guitars and songs that really grow on you over time.I guess all I'm trying, to say, it's worth the wait when an artist perfects their art instead of churning out rubbish twice a year."
__label__2	Handy Device: Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. For the price and size it's a great alternative.
__label__2	The Best Pocket Tripod: This Sony VCT-TK1 is by far the best pocket tripod for instant use. I take it out of my pocket, screw on my camcorder, and it is ready to instantly take videos or self pictures.(Incidently, I have a wide variety of other different pocket-type tripods with three small legs and adjustable ball pan and tilt, but I do not use them.)
__label__2	Good, simple...but limited Korean food: This is a good VEGETARIAN cookbook for those who want to cook meatless Korean food, but in my opinion, it is missing many delicious and meatless Korean dishes. The receipes are simple and easy (and they offer substitutes for certain Korean foods that might be hard to buy in the US.) Overall, good stuff, but you might want to also get a general Korean cookbook for more variety. You can always leave out the meat...
__label__1	"Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas: I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
__label__1	Dreadful: 3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). The rest is spoiled by a pompous, overbearing style that makes it unreadable.
__label__2	Style knowledge by Alan: This book is an excellent source of knowledge and information. So much of the information is still relevant today and is timeless. The deep level of knowledge and in sight into the industry and business is a real feast for the novice.Would recommend this to any man that is interested in his clothing image. The value of representing your self to the best of your ability.Colt 45
__label__2	An Essential Part of your Collection: This book should occupy a prominent place in your collection. Yes its ok to own more than one book on sartorial correctness. Take this book for its strenghts (i.e.,the correct way to buy fine clothes) and don't worry about its drawbacks. This is an excellent source for learning about the theory and practice of dressing like a proper man. Much has been made about the outdated addresses of some of the stores in the second half of the book. Well my response is..get over it. Fine mens stores change addresses, its a fact of life. The important thing is the name and description of the store. With that said, sit back and enjoy the text and pictures and take responsibility for being a well heeled gentleman...if you dare.
__label__2	Great, if limited: Flusser is the second best writer on clothes (Boyer is the best) and the most knowledgeable. This is a very good book, whose only shortcoming is a lack of information. The first sections are shorter than I would have liked them, and the subsequent sections, though fascinating reading, are of limited usefulness to anyone who is not a rich globetrotter.Still, there is a lot of great info in those shop descriptions, but you have to glean it all out. An index would have been welcome.All told: clothing is about taste, and Flusser's taste is the best in the world, bar none. He has more than earned his position as arbiter of men's dress.
__label__1	Overrated book: I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly.
__label__1	"Terrible: What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
__label__2	FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ONLY THE BEST !: MR.FLUSSER IS A MAN OF STYLE AND CLASSICAL ELEGANCE...IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK WHICH WILL TAKE YOU INTO A JOURNEY AMONG THE BEST - AND MOST EXPENSIVE- BRANDS AND SHOPS OF MEN'SWEAR, DON'T HESITATE BUY IT !
__label__2	Outdated sure, but still relevant: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.
__label__2	"thank you for paving the way for me: bryan wilson is da bomb! I am a singer myself and i know good talent when i hear it. and when he sang ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"", it blow me away! He is phenomenal and I love to hear him sing because he feels what he is singing about and what singing really is--the anointing you put into it, not the show so many people try to put on. I wish you much success in the future to come. Maybe I'll get to sing with you when I come out. May God forever bless you in your music ministry! Much love, Your sister in Christ, Connie"
__label__2	An Awesome Ministry: I enjoy your music so much and every last one of your songs touch my heart. As a teenager I consider you a positive appearance and influence to all the other young people that they can be used of God and that they can stay saved. Be Blessed and keep looking up because your help cometh from the Lord and if you acknowledge God in all you do he will direct your path and give you the desires of your heart. God Bless You, take care, and continue to let God use you!
__label__1	sucks: I just received two of these guns today and they both broke after about two minutes of shooting, don't buy it!!!
__label__1	Don't buy this gun!!!!!: I hate this gun. It barely shoots fifteen feet at about 50 feet per second. It looks and shoots cool, but it really sucks. I don't recomend it at all
__label__2	Thank YOU Dr. Bernstein!: This book was a wellspring of information for me as a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic. Getting off the cycle of being told to eat complex carbs, seeing my blood glucose spike from doing just what I was told, and getting medications increased again and again, I read what Dr. Bernstein said with interest. After trying his recommendations I can say with no reservations that this book may have saved my life! I highly recommend it to anyone who has pre-diabetes or diabetes and hope that the general medical community opens their eyes. After only one day of this diet my blood glucose readings were close to normal, and continue to stay there, with less medication. My energy levels are high and I have felt better than I have in a long long time. Kudos to you Dr. Bernstein, for daring to say the truth! I recommend both his books and also Dr. Atkins Diabetes Revolution to anyone who wants to learn about diabetes and diet.
__label__1	Sorry, not convincing at all: Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine.
__label__2	This book is packed with information on Diabetes!: Interesting and informative book! This book is helpful for all diabetics--even those who are very knowledgeable about diabetes. There's always something more to learn about this disease. The diet is very restrictive and challenging to follow. But, a person's health does win out ultimately.
__label__2	"Dr. Bernstein is GREAT!!!: Dr. Bernstein is a type 1 diabetic and had just about every sympton possible. He figured out the ""diabetes code"" and clearly explains how to control your diabetes. His cure is exactly opposite to that of the medical establishment. He was educated as an engineer, then became a medical doctor late in life. His book is designed to educate and not to impress how smart he is. Buy it.David Smith"
__label__2	excellent diabetes guide: This book has solved the problems we had while trying to manage my son's diabetes.You can find all answers in diabetes management.
__label__2	The proof is in the... not pudding...: The proof of a book on health issues is in the results it gets you, and it's very hard to argue with the results I've gotten from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. Many others have reviewed this book more capably than I can, but let me just say that after a few months of following Dr. B's diet, I've lost 50 lbs., gotten normal blood sugars, and feel better than I've felt in years. Highly recommended!
__label__2	A practical life-saving guide.: The book gives practical advice for those with diabetes. I've had type 2 diabetes for 13 years and when another ailment required me to use prednisone, I needed insulin. Dr. Bernstein's book taught me about the types of insulin and syringes. His book removed my apprehension about needles and possible low blood glucose. Like many pioneers in medicine, Dr. Bernstein's ideas were opposite to mainstream methods when his book was first introduced. However, his recommendation for a limited carbohydrate diet like that of the late Dr. Atkins, appears to be gaining acceptance. Control of diabetes is very much up to the patient. Dr. Bernstein's book puts life-saving knowledge in the hands of the patient. I have found it invaluable.
__label__1	Not Really for Diabetes II: This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money.
__label__1	strait to the looney bin: i can't live without carbohidrates! if you want to lose your mind, follow this diet; the pills dr bernstein prescribes for people who are addicted to carbohidrates, my doctor will not prescribe, i know this because he recomended me the high carb low fat diet to loose weight.
__label__1	Misleading: Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
__label__2	Diabetes Solution: This book was amazing. I found it when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes years ago. Dr. Bernstein has a somewhat radical idea that instead of letting blood sugar peak and then pull it back down with meds or insulin is dangerous long term. His idea of controlling and achieving normal blood sugar levels by controlling diet is very good. I have been able to control mine for a number of years, my A1C is 5.3, and excellent value. My doctor got this book after I explained the ideas contained and he agrees with the plan Dr. Bernstein promotes here.
__label__2	Required Reading: I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!
__label__2	The Type 2 Diabetes Answer.: Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience.
__label__1	Good songs, but I have heard them all already: The Dissapointed. Why do I need demos of all the songs already on Apple Venus 1. Let's bring on Apple Venus 2, after all, isn't that what we were promised?
__label__1	thumbs down: I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!
__label__2	Very nice: Yes, the arrangements are almost identical to the studio release. But in many cases the performances are superior. Vocals come through clearer; ideas are more obvious. It's a real testament to their musicianship/professionalism that the songs are so similar in demo and final form. Clearly, they are their own producers, rather than pretty faced fools who let others turn their songs into hits. Have some heart, pundits. They need the money. I read a long (and entertaining) interview where they described how much it cost to rent the orchestra for one day. It wiped out almost all the money they had. Yes, their own money. So if you wanna hear the second Apple Venus, quit yer yappin. This demo CD is for supporters and fans of musicians, rather than record companies.
__label__2	I think you're missing the point.: I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?
__label__1	Lame: Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking.
__label__1	These chip: The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice.
__label__2	Just the perfect thing.: I only use these during the winter, but they are so wonderful for warm winter drinks. Hot chocolate with whipped cream, hot apple cider with a cinnamon stick, hot buttered rum, mulled wine, homemade egg nog. Mmmmm.When I received these I promptly dropped one on the tile from about five feet. It damaged my foot on the bounce more than it was damaged. Actually, it was completely fine - not a single chip. Big, thick, durable - everything they should be.
__label__1	Not for Boiling Liquids?????????: I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful.
__label__1	fragile.. fragile....very fragile...: I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price.
__label__1	Nice Basic Mug: I like the size and style of these mugs, they go with anything and look like they'll last a long time.--- EDITED REVIEW --- Long term? not very durable. All but one have broken.
__label__2	size of mugs: The mugs are very nice, but I guess I didn't think of the 16 oz. size, as a result they are much larger than I would have liked them...other than that they are very nice and will be put to use...
__label__2	feel good music: This CD is typical of what your would expect from Idle Cure, good, old fashioned rock 'n' roll with Christian tones and themes. The music is inspirational and makes you feel good as you listen to it. I think any Christian rock fan would enjoy this. Idle Cure has a unigue sound that sets them apart from other bands. Give it a listen- you will like it.
__label__1	Core Sports Performance: A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
__label__2	Very impressive book that deserves its high reputation.: This may have been written for professional military scholars and experts, but it is also of immense value to amateurs and military buffs. This is solid, heavy going but deeply analytical and more informative than any other book on the subject. It ranks alongside Ziemke and Bauer, David Glantz, and John Erickson (who have written a stunning review of it) as a top Stalingrad book.
__label__2	Lufwaffe operations from the Crimea to Stalingrad: An exellent study of the German Airforce from the fall of Sevastopol in the Crimea to its failure at Stalingrad. Very well written, with a clear analysis of the events. Well worth the money and it belongs in every major collection on World War II's Eastern Front.
__label__2	"Unsurpassed in importance!: The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate ""classic"" status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis. VERY highly recommended!"
__label__2	"AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK: This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
__label__2	Very good book: This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck. If you overlook those issues, it is a very good book
__label__2	A must-have for everyone interested in the Stalingrad Battle: Recently I ordered 'Stopped at Stalingrad' from amazon.com. It was well worth the puchase, as the book is both a profoundly researched study and an interesting read. It's a scholarly work which, undoubtedly, will become a classic in its field.Dénes Bernád, Aviation Historian and Author
__label__2	Good Book on Eastern Front Luftwaffe: I learned a lot about the Eastern Front Luftwaffe. It is as much a study in the personalities as it is a history, strategy book.
__label__1	Sufi is inSUFIcient: Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction.
__label__1	Not authentic: The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires.
__label__1	Much ado about latin ballroom tango: This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you.
__label__1	How Not to become a good Argentine Tango dancer: This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Even ballroom dancing has now a separate category for Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, this video is not that. That's why, I rate it at 1.
__label__1	Overpriced: The price is too high for a VHS tape. Also, the title is misleadig, as Latin dancing has nothing in common with Argentine Tango. If you are NOT interested in authentic Tango Argentino, and don't mind paying the high price for ballroom instruction on tape, then this video is for you.
__label__1	too dark to see the instructors.: this video has a lot of dances for learning but each dance has only 3 steps so dont expect so much from this teaching video. if you want more than 3 steps then buy videos exclusively for a particular dance. this video will just wet your appetite but will not fill your hunger. also, the background setting of this video is very dark as if you are inside a dark night club so you cannot see the footsteps of the teachers because both of them were wearing black pants that blend with the dark background, terrible! plus the teachers teach from the side of the camera and sometimes facing the camera. this is not the ideal way to teach dance in a video. the teachers should be back to the camera so you can follow their footwork. for the money they charge for this video is not worth it.
__label__1	Tapes don't work for me.: There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape.
__label__2	Written with complete candor.: The Rangers have a very interesting and colorful history. Unfortunately, not much of it positive. Nadel fills in all the blanks that existed from the Rangers formative years, stories that were too sensitive at the time they occurred, i.e. Rogelio Moret's mental illness, something that was never addressed in the papers of the day. I assume the Rangers had a say in the editing of this book and I commend them for not trying to make Nadel whitewash the team's history.This book is where history begins and ends if you follow the Rangers.
__label__2	excellent: I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2	Good Reference for Disney World: We're gearing up toward a Disney World vacation late this August, and have relied on this book thoroughly. It isn't the most comprehensive book, but it offers lots of good advice. Good thing for any travelling family.
__label__1	"this book was a big dissapointment: I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
__label__2	Great Info...especially about the Disney Cruise Line: We were looking for a book with information about the Disney Crusie Line with children. We are taking our daughters (9 and 13) on the Disney Wonder in February 2001, and we were looking for some insight that our travel agent couldn't give us. This book explained everything from check in at our Disney Resort to boarding the ship....it also explained all the activities available for our children and the dining schedules. I definately recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the same information that we were looking for!! (or any information on Disney with kids!!!)
__label__2	Intro to Geography: People, Places, and Environment (4th Edition): I used this product for my World Geography course in college. A decent text book and a lot cheaper than what the college store was asking for. A few typos and a few wrong facts but other than that a pretty good text book.
__label__2	Thumbs up: Great product. Now I'll be able to study for my final exam andNot worry about depending on others to help me study.
__label__2	Quick service!: I ordered this book for school and expected to get the book within a few weeks. I received the book less than a week later! The book was in the same condition that was listed. I would recommend this seller to anyone needing textbooks at a good price.
__label__2	Mercer Mayer Books: All 3 of my children, ages 25 to 13 have had the Mercer Mayer books and loved them - I am now buying for my 3 year old grand-daughter, and she too loves these. I think these are a must for every child!
__label__2	Timeless: I love these books and I've started one of my nieces on the little critter series which she is loving. Especially when she sees a small mouse of something in the corner of the picture, she thinks it's really cute and funny.
__label__1	"Not as good as most: I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
__label__2	Blaze Horse Books: C.W. Anderson wrote a wonderful series of books about the adventures of Billy and Blaze. I read them as a child, probably more than once, so I bought the entire series to read to and give to my horse-loving granddaughter and grandson. These books are classics.
__label__2	A Classic!: My 5 year old twin boys have just begun to enjoy this series of books after reading two of the Billy and Blaze books saved from my own childhood. I decided to complete the collection for them and have bought all the other books. These classic boy-and-faithful-horse-adventure stories have a timeless appeal that have been a joy to revisit for me and to discover for the first time for them.
__label__2	Cassie is AWESOME: I started reading Cassie Edwards books this yr. I was into the Harlquin Super Romance Books and believe me, I havent picked one of the HSR books up since I first read this book. I have since got my mother and my best friend reading these books also. We swap books so often and everytime we see a new book by Cassie we grab it. She is an excellant write that I would not mind meeting and telling her in person that her books have touched me and my family. My love for my husband even grew stronger by the love the Indians show. I am working on my heritage (Cherokee) as we speak. Keep up the great work Cassie
__label__2	A must read for those who love Indian romances.: 1877 - South Dakota to MissouriCassie Edwards' love for Indian romances is very apparent! I get the impression her heart and soul is poured into each romance she writes. THUNDER HEART like her others, is a revealing, honest, and romantic look at Indian history.Thunder Heart's band has been named Musti-Ponca (Warm Ponca) because the white man has moved his tribe to Missouri. On the trip his loss was tremendous, and now as they sit and wait on the white man, his chieftain father and his people are ill.

__label__1	"Nice Title!: It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
__label__1	DVD PhotoPlay Doesn't Work: I bought this software one month ago. I was required to immediately update it to fix problems that existed with the version I bought. I was able to navigate the program with ease and build a slide show with-in minutes. Now, for the bad news. It would not burn onto a cd-r as described. I contacted v-coms tech support and received a response within a day or two. The patch did not fix the problem and now after several attempts to reach them again, it seems I am stuck with another neat idea that doesn't work. Still waiting for help.
__label__1	Not worth it!: It wasn't long before I realized I just wasted (my money) on this near worthless software. No transitions effects/No ability to burn multiple albums to a VCD/Horrible music timimng!/No SVCD support/Music drop outs during slideshow. Sorry but I can't recomend thissoftware to anyone!!!
__label__1	"Save your money!: I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
__label__1	Horrible!: I just recently purchased this near worthless software and found out very quickly that I just wasted [my money]! The music timing is all up to you!(so why did I buy this program?) They give you a chart and you must arrange the number of pictures to fit the music or else your slides end in an awkward manner without music or overrun. Yes you can adjust the time for all the slides but it's in 1 second intervals and in a 50 picture show that's 50 secondsa show you can be off by because you can't adjust each frame it's all or nothing. ...
__label__1	Not worth your time: This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. Unless, you already own Powerpoint it is also useless. You cannot add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay. As far as adding background music good luck. The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it won't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast, complete, easy, and flexible.
__label__1	THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE!: I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package. I installed it, I made sure my photos were .jpgs, etc. I mean, I'm not stupid and I can read the simple instructions. It previewed on my computer just fine. I'm running XP-Home. Anyway, I can't burn the CD... it goes through the motions then it gives me one of 4 different reasons it won't burn. I called Tech Support. One guy was really rude, the next guy was good and said he'd send a new installation disk that day. Two weeks later, I got it. Uninstalled the program, reinstalled from the new disk, and OH BOY! A FIFTH ERROR MESSAGE. My computer is new, fast, and has an extra graphics card. 10GB hard drive, 512, the works. I am so sorry I got so excited about this worthless piece of software. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
__label__2	Absolutely Worth It !!!!!: Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me.
__label__1	Just buy from amazon not an indie seller: I ordered it new and it came in in an already opened case and it was fairly poor condition I had to tape it for it to stay together....enough said
__label__1	"Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released: This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
__label__1	Spiderman 3 was horrible.: Personally I would NOT buy the trilogy because spiderman 3 was horrible, 1 & 2 where great though. 3 not so good!
__label__1	Why am I re-buying this again?: Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?
__label__2	Excellect Value and Fast Service: When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products.
__label__1	did not purchase: why am I being asked to review a product I didn't purchase. Need to fix the system or allow me to delete the request.
__label__1	Blu Ray for 1& 2 has none of the DVD extras.: Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL.

__label__1	No spanish audio nor subtitles for 2 & 3: Good fun movies and nice compilation but... Spiderman 2 and 3 do not offer any audio or subtitles in spanish. If like myself you need them, then don't buy this version. Look for each one individually for a version that has at least subtitles.
__label__2	Worth the Purchase if You Own an HDTV: I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection.
__label__2	Spider-Fan: I cant wait to get this movie on Blu Ray..I already own the first 2 but its gonna be worth seeing them on Blu Ray in HD!!
__label__1	"Poor quality of wrapping: I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
__label__1	"Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3: I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
__label__1	WANT REFUND!: The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work.
__label__1	AUDIO: Russian, Czech and Polish: I bought this item because on Amazon I could see AUDIO: Englsih, French and Spanish;I am spanish speaker. I have the package now,but with Czech, English, Russian, Polish and Hungarian audio only (even spanish subtitles); the problem is that I can't send the movies back because I live in Latin America and is very expensive.This is a fraud, I have only one option...throw away the films. I have spent my money on garbage.COMPRÉ ESTE PAQUETE DE PELÍCULAS PORQUE EN AMAZON DICE QUE TIENE AUDIO EN INGLÉS, FRANCÉS Y ESPAÑOL; MI SORPRESA FUE QUE AL RECIBIR EL PAQUETE SOLO TIENE AUDIO EN CHECO, RUSO, INGLÉS Y POLACO, EN ESPAÑOL NI SIQUIERA SUBTÍTULOS. NO PUEDO ENVIAR DEVOLVER EL PAQUETE PORQUE VIVO EN LATINOAMÉRICA; LA ÚNICA OPCIÓN ES TIRARLO A LA BASURA. ESTO ES UN FRAUDE.
__label__1	Doesn't work!: We have ordered this DVD set 2 times and we have had to send it back each time. We also bought a set a SAMS CLUB today and it doesn't work either. Yes, we tried to play all 3 discs and in every DVD player in the house. We LOVE the movies and wanted to share the fun with our son who is now so disappointed. Save your receipt!
__label__1	this is not a region 1 set: I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Toby McGuyre Spider-Man suffers in comparison: Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison
__label__1	Worst yet!: Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up.
__label__2	Great value: I got this for 40 something dollars and it was a great vale for my pocket, plus the great pic quality
__label__1	"Not a real collection boxset.: I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
__label__1	all three discs skip: After I purchased these movies, I did not watch them right away. Once i did watch them I found out that they all skip badly. Unfortunately it was already passed the return date policy.
__label__2	What you would expect: Packaging is Ok but not great. Blu-Ray transfers are more than adequate. Fast shipping. There are a few different Blu-Ray collections out there and I am happy I went with this one.
__label__2	"This is HIGH DEFINITION!: A wonderful, exciting adventure in the best HD I've seen so far. Whomever said any of these movies was ""grainy"" didn't watch it on a TV as good as my Mitsubishi Diamond Series.The story was great and endearing, the casting was great, Spiderman was perfect and the HD was breataking.This is what good movies are all about: telling a story, using artistic means to do it, and have a great cast to do it.And, of course, the ending was great too."
__label__2	I Can See Clearly Now.....: The picture quality is among the best I have seen for a blu-ray. The sound quality is pristine. I rocked the house playing it through my home theater system. The reason it got 4 stars was for the lack of special features for both Spider-man and Spider-man 2. This set included Spider-man 2.1(Extended Version), which was nice, so the trilogy is almost a quadrilogy. I waited for a price-drop since I had all on dvd prior to my purchase.
__label__2	Great: My son just started getting into superheros and Spiderman was at the top of his list. I found the triology on Amazon right away and at a great price. The movies arrived in very little time and in great shape. I love Amazon and will always continue to shop here.Tiffany
__label__1	Perfect if I Lived In Europe: Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.
__label__1	Movies good but set is very cheap in quality: Felt like a cheap knockoff. Definitely works well for people that just want the movies but no money or effort was spent on the container.
__label__2	Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Triology: This item was a gift and I am basing my review on the three movies which I have seen.
__label__2	"It's Spiderman: I'd seen all 3 movies prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it. My only commentary is, ""It's Spiderman"". I think that says enough. I'm well pleased with the delivery terms, condition and quality of the products."
__label__1	Have not recieved it: I can't rate this item because I have not received it. I have had this problem when I tried to order the toy story pack of one and two.
__label__2	Awesome Blu Ray Set!: This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. I do have all 3 movies on dvd, but this is one film franchise I don't mind double dipping into. The transfers to blu ray are spectacular. Great picture quality, and sound. My only complaint is that the special features for the first 2 films are non existent, but like I said, I have the dvds so if I needed to get my special feature fix then I could just pop those in. If your like me and love these movies, then do yourself a favor and get the set. You won't be disappointed!
__label__2	light, tasty and healthy: Great taste, although a higher in calories than some of the other cereals and good in Folic acid and heat healthy.Wonder why it is not available at the local grocery stores?
__label__1	There are much better train CDs out there than this!!!: The picture on the front of the CD is very deceiving. It shows a steam engine (an American-type steam engine, as a matter of fact) and there are no sounds of steam in the entire CD. All you hear for 90 percent of the time are slick wheels running on rails -- no engine sounds, no locomotives working hard or switching. In my opinion, this album is not worth the money for steam rail fans. If there had been a picture one of the European (or Asian) electric-powered trains that you hear on this CD, I would have never bought it.
__label__2	excellent!: Excellent overview of the history of Paganism. The paperback is in horrible fine print, though. This should be on every bookshelf, as it dispells myths while humanizing the myth makers.
__label__2	I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!: FINALLY!! A REAL historian who writes from a position of sympathy towards modern witches and pagans while unceremoniously debunking most all of the pet fantasies held by many feminist oriented authors today. Of course, I don't agree with ALL of what he says here, but boy did he ever open a can of worms and make me think! I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?
__label__2	Phenomenal!: Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written.
__label__2	How a religion is Born!: This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!
__label__1	linear thinking loud equals authority: idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly.
__label__2	Worth Reading: Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community.
__label__1	will it never end!?: Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!
__label__2	Long Overdue: This is a pioneering work, the first history of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Hutton himself admits the diffculty of the task)gives a full scholarly review of the Pagan movement, its history and the ideas and cultural background of its tenents. Outstanding!
__label__2	Excellent History of the Development of Wicca and Modern Paganism: I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!
__label__2	camcorder cable: This is a must have cable if you're going to transfer your videos to your computer. Sony does not supply the cable with its HD camcorders. If you edit your videos and/or make DVDs, you will need this cable.
__label__1	Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony: Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business.
__label__1	I got the same thing from CompUSA $3.99: I was shocked at how expensive this is so I searched other sites for one. I found a 4-pin to 6-pin firewire at CompUSA's website for $3.99 TOTAL (free shipping!) This Sony cable works great, but I can't tell the difference between it and my cheap one...thus the one star.
__label__1	Cable not what it is sold as: Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.
__label__1	Undecided - Be cautious: It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning.
__label__2	Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable: The cable works great. I have been uploading Digital8 video to my processor for editing projects with no problems. The cord could be a bit longer than its 1.5 meters but that's not a major concern. It was a bit pricey, but the steep markup on cords is pretty common across the board. All in all a good purchase.
__label__2	Video cable: This was the perfect cable to upload my videos from my Sony video camcorder to my PC. Easy to setup and works with the installed software. Operates faster than expected.
__label__1	Upgrade computer: If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn't work. So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match.
__label__1	"what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29!: I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."
__label__2	good: good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. strange.
__label__2	nice and simple: I looked everywhere for a nice, simple design. I must have browsed hundreds of different styles. Anchor Hocking's Bolera set is just right - simple but not obviously.The glass is just wide enough for cleaning thoroughly by hand and the bottom has a nice weight to it as well - not easy to knock over. The sides aren't terribly fragile, but they're not uncommonly sturdy either. I have broken a few.
__label__1	"Phantom Glasses - Beware!: Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
__label__1	"Complaint: I first saw this ad before Christmas, and decided to check back later. I have checked 7 times since then and the glasses are never in stock, but I should ""Get in line""?I don't shop at Amazon in order to be ""in line"" for 2 months.Does this stuff exist or is simply a method to get you ""on the line""?"
__label__1	Great graphics, no story line, no point.: great if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner. only problem is the time clock is always ticking making this an arcade adventure rather than a video game. Don't waste the money, good graphics or not, this game is not entertaining.
__label__1	Flatout is flat: This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc
__label__1	Copy Protection Breaks Game: I have one of the newer AMD Dual Core processors. After installing this game I attempted to play and it bombed out.Searching on support forums, it appears the copy protection software has a problem with dual core processors (amd and intel). And it doesn't look like the game maker is going to release a patch any time soon. Too bad, I really like the original game and was hoping to have more fun with the sequel.
__label__1	If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you.: If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe.
__label__2	Helpful in time of loss: This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss.
__label__2	A great choice if you're looking for something simple: Very simply, with few words, this book explains that there is a beginning and an end. In the middle is life. Beginnings and endings are going on around us all the time. For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point.
__label__2	You'll read it and discover why you need it: I used to think that there was no strategy, per se, to fishing a lake--a big tub of water you trolled until you got an arbitrary hit.This book takes an almost forensic view of a lake's features--water layers, vegetation, etc.--and shows how to read them and catch fish. It's much more detailed than I expected and I came away with a real sense of how to find trout as quickly as possible.
__label__2	Great books on fly fishing: I have read many authors on the subject of fly fishing. Dave Hughes is a great writer. He puts it in a language a beginner can understand. I am not a beginner but I really like to read his books. I had several of his books and gave them to our new county library. Then I missed them, so I went on amazon and re-bought several of them. Great service! Would do it again. Tight lines.
__label__1	Break too easily: My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past.
__label__2	Owned these for years, they're great!: I love the look of these, and they've been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I'm stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Thank you, Amazon.com!
__label__1	Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality: The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase.
__label__1	Poor engineering: This series of DVDs offers some fine performances along with a great deal of annoyance. The top menu offers no access points to most of the listed repertory. Tried on several different machines the problem is persistant. At least the price is reasonable if you don't mind fast forwarding through all tracks to get to the later pieces.
__label__1	Difficult product: I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. However, it is very difficult to access the work. I finally figured out that the only way to do it is to fast forward through the final movement of the Lebrun Concerto. This problem was in evidence on several different DVD players one of which can track DVDs with any region code. There are some wonderful performances on this series. Too bad the engineering is so poor.
__label__1	pitchshifter is not the same!: When i first heard about deviant, i thought it would be something great (judging by previous records and the way Ps developed in their musical style). But after finally listening thru it i suddenly realised PS was trying to go mainstream. Their new CD is so much alike with Korn or limp bizkit music it was terryifing. I couldn't understand why Ps chose to opt out of the electronics towards more punk/rock style. In general this CD has some good tracks (2 to be exact), but it not deliver the goods like the previous CD's did. I AM SORELY DISSAPOINTED!
__label__1	"What happened to Pitchshifter?: The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
__label__1	Why, Pitchshifter?: This album sucks bad. I can't believe Jello participated in this. The only reason could be the lyrics, which are the only thing good about this album. If I read the lyrics but never listened to the music, I would like something about this product. This music is mainstream pseudo-post-(wannabe)punk garbage a la Korn (who also sucks). Too bad pitchshifter changed so drastically. Their first few were really good.
__label__2	"Brilliant: Once again Pitchshifter seems to have outdone themselves. With cuts like ""Hidden agenda"" and ""Condescension"" How can one go wrong. With Pitchshifter's hard-edged combination of punk, techno, and metal; and the brutal social commentary, this easily became one of my favorties."
__label__2	very good: i agree that pitchshifter has changed from their previous album, but i wouldnt go so far as to say they sound anything like limp bizkit (thank god), as one of the previous reviewers said. the entire cd is listenable, but some are quite a bit better than others. i would choose tracks one and seven as my favorites. as good as this cd is, it isnt as good as www.pitchshifter.com. i hope their style of music influences some other bands, because it can be a beautiful thing. heheh.
__label__1	Bratz Helmet: When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended.

__label__2	Beautiful glasses at a great price!: These are very attractive looking glasses that feel very nice. They are well made and not flimsy, yet they are not heavy to hold. They make whatever you are drinking seem to be more of a treat.
__label__2	"Great Everyday Glassware: Though the Carlyle glassware is currently out of stock, I decided to write a review assuming they'll be back. I bought these glasses over a year ago after noticing that I was down to mismatched glasses in the cabinet that I didn't like much.After looking around the store, I decided on these. Generally, I like to buy glasses at a physical store because of the ""touch"" factor. Each of the exterior widening ""steps"" in the design helps keep the glass from slipping from one's grasp. Simple, but very cool idea that looks good too. It's been great for kids (runs in the family). They come out of the dishwasher looking great. I also like the idea that this is an old design from the 1930's.Finally, maybe the best thing; they're tough, and don't break when you'd expect. We've accidentally knocked them off a side table onto our marble floor too many times and are always amazed that they're in one piece.These are great for everyday use and I highly recommend them."
__label__2	Wonderful: My mother brought the first book of the series with us as reading material on a 4 week holiday in Scotland. I imediatly fell in love with it and upon returning to Canada devoured the series. They are incredibly exciting and the series as a whole is a must read. I recommend them to anyone who wants a good plot at an easy writing level.
__label__2	Perfect Christmas gift!: Very happy with purchase. Item was shipped fast, nicer than expected and the price was very reasonable. Ping to be a nice Christmas gift.
__label__2	"Ramazing: Wow..thats basically all i can say. I bought the cd, then realized that they were playin live like 20 minutes from my house. They put on an amazing show! They closed it with do you call my name, then went backstage. The crowd started chanting, ""ONE MORE SONG!!"" The drummer came out and started playing again. Then all the rest came back out and played one last song. Ra is underrated and a great bunch of guys. I got my cd autographed by all 4 and i got a picture with them. Buy From One, Duality, and SEE THEM LIVE!! My ears are still ringing."
__label__2	Awsome Album for an Awsome Band: This CD is absolutely great. They have some great full sounding tracks. I had heard a few songs on the radio, and so I bought the CD and absolutely loved virtually every song on the CD.Also had a chance to see these guys in concert, and personally thought they were better live than on the album. Dont pass up a chance to buy the album or see them live!
__label__1	These guys really suck.: This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread.
__label__2	Never bought the first one, this isn't bad.: Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too.
__label__2	"Another RA Gem!: For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
__label__1	"From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality: When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."
__label__1	"17 years old and it shows: Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
__label__1	So so only: Very basic . More challenging and rewarding exercises not covered . Many routines designed to be done with a partner than alone
__label__2	Wonderful: It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. Very helpful and easy to use.
__label__1	poor service from amazon: wow this is the first time im ever writing a review for a cd i never got to listen to (thanks to the poor slow sevice from amazon).Ordered this item april 15 2011 .First i was supposed to get it by april 29th then they pushed it to may 27th poor timing for amazon because they screwed up a previous order .I cancelled this order it was supposed to be an anniversary gift for my husband .I suggest people be careful when ordering this product because it will take its sweet time getting there if it does at all or maybe you will get it by next year.I was being very generous rating 1 star not for the music but for the poor service i will not be re ordering
__label__1	Not a scholarly book: The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people.
__label__1	Mindless and thoughtless: Regardless of you religious beliefs, this book is the biggest waste of time since Ernest Goes To Jail. PLEASE freakin' tell me these guys aren't college professors. Never has a less researched, less thought-provoking book ever been written. It is an insult to read. Don't waste your time.
__label__1	FOR LOVE OF GOD AND COUNTRY: Please I read this book to give chance to opposition but found no credibility in the writers themselves. No Footnotes come on. Please go to [...]or even better go to their wallbuilders live podcast and find out about what the forefathers intended. They talk of the true definition of seperation of church and state. While at the same time hold ownership of articles that are displayed at the Smithsonian. They own thousands of articles including forefather letters and journals. In their own words letting you know from fact that this was to be a God Fearing Nation. David Barton offers books with insight into this subject for real minimal prices. I have seen his books and cd's on amazon. Doesnt it make sense to trust the words directly from our forefathers hand written words, or atleast from some one that owns the actual articles. See for yourselves please. May God Bless America.
__label__1	"This work has NO citations - not a scholarly book: This work has NO citations. It is not a scholarly book. The note in the back of the book mentions a few sources, but there are no direct citations for most of their ""godless"" assertions in the text of the book. Thus, the authors take huge liberties with their assertions. They ignore blaring facts such as over half of the signers of the Constitution had degrees in divinity."
__label__1	"Brain washing: I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
__label__1	This is fallacious: wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing.
__label__1	Baseless, made up propaganda: This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic.
__label__1	the man from utah: the movie was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks
__label__1	Definitely not her best.: Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine
__label__2	"Pretty Awesome!!: This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about ""Creatures Of The Night"" :)"
__label__1	"Everlasting Love--what else?: This book was not the best. It was boring and the characters were underdeveloped. I liked the idea that Gillian WASN'T gorgeous, rich, and plain perfect, but in a snap she became the typical LJ Smith character. I love the idea of soulmates and everything, but I think these kids find their soulmates too easily, and how come everyone in LJ Smith books have to be SO perfect? Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are ""perfect"" on top of that? If you want to read LJ Smith, read the trilogies or even the other Night World books because this book reads like LJ Smith was getting desperate for a ""new"" idea."
__label__2	This book is great! Get it now! Don't hestitate!: This book was wonderful and enjoyable, just like all the other Night World books. I was so smitthen with all the books that I even composed a poem on it.This book is greatGuranteed to make your eyes go redReally, I'm not lyingyou may even go swimming
__label__2	Pretty Good: I've read all of the Night World books, and this is a great book, but I must say, it's not L. J. Smith's best
__label__1	I can't belive LJS wrote this: I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all.
__label__2	it was good i dont see the problem: it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. i mean it did have soulmates in and we got to see ash again which gains any book about three stares however short a time its for. i hope as is in the last book
__label__1	This book wasn't near as good as the others: Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera.
__label__1	the worst book in the entire night world series!!!: this is the worst night world book that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. another reason why this book [is bad] the only part i like is that there's an apppearance by one of my fave characters of the series-ASh i swear he would be more funner 2 read if the book was only bout him!!! angel wasnt a good character either and david [wasn't either]!! i recommend teens 2 not by this book it really stinks alot!!
__label__1	not the best book!!: well first of all i thought that this was the worst night world book in the series and believe me i have and read all 9 of them. Gillian is just so shallow and a little sissy the only thing she wants is to be popular and have David as her bf like its the most important thing in the world!! i thought David was stupid too he seem to only fall in love with Gillian because of her transformation to being well liked he was just being shallow and really stupid. i think Gillian and David are the most stupidest characters in the entire night world series!! so far this was not the best book so far. the only part i liked was where Ash showed up i was totally happy when he was in this book. he is just funny and such a hottie to be with. the other books i recomend is Witchlight, Daughters of darkness, Soulmate, The chosen, and Black dawn.
__label__2	Angel?: Gillain, a shy girl, is rescued from near death by an angel.The Angel helps Gillain get things she never had, like poularityand the attention from a guy she likes, whose name is David (which has a girlfriend). Angel tells Gillain to hurt people to get what she wants. it gets to the point where Gillain can't take it anymore and she wants him to go away. Gillain gets into alot of trouble with Angel and doesn't know how to make him go away. So what Gillain does is she...*Want to know the rest, read the book and you'll find out*I'ts a really good book!
__label__1	I can't believe she wrote this!: LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one.
__label__1	Worst book by LJ!: Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable.
__label__1	Labor Can Do No Wrong: This old book (written in the 1950s) is published by a labor union because mainstream publishers would not touch it. Union people love this book because it makes union leaders out to be martyrs and saviors of the world, standing up to those mean, greedy old corporate capitalists. For these authors, the story of labor is black and white, no shades of gray. Labor can do no wrong and never has done any wrong. The Molly Maguires were not draft dodgers and murderers, but innocent martyrs who got framed. The Homestead rioters were poor oppressed immigrants asserting their right to take control of steel mills, and are not not to be blamed for beating and shooting the police or trying to assassinate the company president. The western miners headed by Communist Big Bill Haywood didn't really blow up mines with dynamite, the mine owners did it just so they could blame the union. This book isn't history, it's a cartoon of history. Don't look for any balance, objectivity or nuance here.
__label__1	"Left-Wing Propaganda: This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
__label__2	A Great Place to Start...: This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know where the modern labor laws and labor unions come from. It depicts in stark detail the criminal acts against American working people that do not show up in many textbooks.
__label__2	Asatru music in fine form: Hagalaz Runedance contains ten tracks of wonderfully composed and sung songs which are written from a heathen perspective. Asatruar everywhere will absoutely love this music. It's done in a celtic/renissance style which is easy to listen to as well as learn to sing yourself. The emotions range from haunted to joyous and loss as the songs recount tales of old, and of loss and of joy.Hail to Hagalaz Runedance for creating this excellent work which will uplift the souls of all who may hear it!
__label__2	Not classic, but Inspiring haiku, bringing art into everyday: I received this book as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another.
__label__1	"Three Lines Do Not Always Equal Haiku: Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a ""season word"" and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson."
__label__1	No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say.: You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one.
__label__1	"Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe...: This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
__label__1	"The only stars is the rocker: You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
__label__1	"It's the end of haiku as we know it...: This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
__label__2	Fun For Everyone: Witty and fun songs for everyone from as young as 2 to adult. Has a great message and highly recommended.
__label__2	"The funniest CD out there: The whole thing is worth its weight in gold just for the ""dance of the cucumber"" song....El baile del pepino, el baile del pepino..hmm hmm hmmm...I LOVE IT"
__label__2	Funny and all around Great!!!!!!: Larry the Cucumber makes this cd hilarious!!!!!This is a great Christian cd with great music that you can sing along with and never get tired of. You are bound to enjoy this cd! It has great life lessons just like the movies. I recommend this cd to any one of any age. You will definetly enjoy!
__label__1	Get ready for standardized test: Horrible product! Too much talking about general stuff. Not enough real tests. Very low level of expertise. it is just ridiculous how people can get published with such book about nothing. Bits and pieces here and there. Please, Amazon, do not sell this book - too little of material for too much money. It's a SHAME!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	"There is more to this story ...: I am the author of an article for ""The Skeptical Inquirer"" about the origins of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about ""The Mothman Prophecies"" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
__label__1	"poorly written nonsense: The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
__label__1	Boring: Garbage. The author is no different from the other 50,000 lunatics running around the country chasing lights. The only difference is this guy wrote a book. Watch the X Files instead..
__label__1	Dull, Disjointed: Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie.
__label__1	"Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney: I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
__label__2	"Good story, but very skeptical about the writer.: I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the ""Good story teller"" catagory and not a ""ufooligist"". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book."
__label__1	"Disappointing: The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
__label__1	repetitive, lackluster: I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)
__label__1	mothman-putting the loose ends together?: I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......
__label__1	"Very Detailed and Never Ending: I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual ""mothman"" and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named ""Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink."" I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."
__label__2	Paranormal epic: This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo.
__label__2	A must for Fortean buffs: Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field.
__label__2	"GET THIS BOOK WHILE ITS STILL IN PRINT: Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. ""Belief is the enemy"",warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."
__label__1	the movie was better: Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow.
__label__1	"Where's the beef or Mothman in this case?: There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of ""Mothman"" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. ""Show me the pictures."""
__label__1	Pretty disappointed: I saw the movie and was intrigued enough to read the book, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Keel spent a lot of time dwelling on UFO encounters and the history of UFO encounters and spent little time talking about the events in West Virginia, other than how it blended with the history of UFO-logy. The movie was more interesting, and I don't know how they developed a movie based off of this book. I didn't buy the book to read about Air Force involvement (or maybe lack thereof) in UFO sightings or about how Mr. Keel had been hunting UFOs and UFO witnesses. A big letdown.
__label__1	Little Value: It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond
__label__1	"A waste of time: Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
__label__1	"So What: If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book. Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters. There is not an ounce of structure to this. It's just a bunch of thoughts and ""reports"" of sightings of UFO's, ""mothmen"" and other oddities. I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel. I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance. All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!?!"
__label__1	"Thoroughly Debunked: This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's ""weird"" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.""Mothman"" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."
__label__1	Mothman Fiction: The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.
__label__1	"Okay!?...: I'll admit it, I didn't have a clue what was going on in this book (which claims to be real, but is obviously a work of fiction), nor did I really have much of a reason to.UFOs...Men in black...Mothmen...Abductees...government coverups...sightings...It's all here, and regardless makes no sense whatsoever.I actually walked into this thinking it was going to be great, that there would be a wonderful story based upon the legend of the mothman, but no I was bombarded with 266 pages of ""research"" having no really meaning, or thesis. Honestly, I say avoid this like the plague."
__label__1	"Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . . .: It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
__label__1	Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them: Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it.
__label__2	Good Read: Good read. If half of what is written in this book is true; then are world is much stranger than we can imagine.One of my favorite books.
__label__1	Boring & Unbelievable Story: Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD.
__label__1	"Unidentified Reading Object: I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, ""ufo"" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."
__label__2	"Interesting: This was a very fascinating read. It does not focus only on Mothamn sightings, but all the other strange events that were supposed to have happened. If you are looking for a book that will prove Mothman exists, I don't think this is the proper book for you. It is mainly about what went on from the first sighting of Mothman to the felling of the bridge. There were a lot of strange happenings during that time. I read this as ""I'm presenting you with the information as to what heppened as I saw it and was involved in it, and you make up your mind as to whether its true or not""."
__label__1	Not what you'd expect!: Although the movie was very well done for those who enjoyed a spooky and suspenseful story, the book however is not the movie. It seems that Hollywood took very few pieces from the book and turned it in to a great movie which is kind of the other way around from the usual book being better than the movie. This book is good if your a UFO buff only. It mentions the Mothman but other than that it was a very boring read as I expected to be reading about the same scenario as what I saw in the movie. I was extremely disappointed.
__label__1	huh?: I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story.
__label__1	Amazon.com Customer Reviews...: Don't waste your time reading them...They tell you absolutely nothing. Each entry contradicts the other.Remember, humans write these things.
__label__1	Is this a first draft?: The little content contained is interesting.However, the entire book is short chapters of journal notes with the occasional splash of commentary thrown in.Badly written, poorly organized.He could have at least organized it chronologically.The constant way of making himself out to besome sort of superhero got very annoying very quickly.
__label__1	BORING!: The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money.
__label__1	"A Let-Down...: John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
__label__1	The Mothman in Bits and Pieces: This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences. It is difficult to read, not only because of the bad press printing, but also because it is very clipped and disjointed. I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!
__label__2	"It was a dark and stormy night: John Keel's ""The Mothman Prophecies"" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious ""sightings"". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, ""It was a dark and stormy night.""Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest. Men in Black? Saucer shaped vehicles with diamond-shaped windows? ""Thyroid-like eyes""? If this gets your attention, you'll enjoy ""The Mothman Prophecies.""The recent movie is based only loosely on Keel's research, by the way, and will fail to satisfy informed ufology readers."
__label__1	"Lame: This book [stinks]. I read this book only, because I seen the preview for the movie. It jumps around from one thing to the next. John Keel is a nut, ""the phone rang and nobody was there!"" ""That could only mean the time traveling space aliens, cause no human would be capable of calling my house and hanging up."" ""The CIA/FBI are out to get me"" Please!!! Go see a shrink."
__label__2	Believe it or not, it's scary either way.: The great thing about this book is it works as a nonfiction book, if you're a believer and as a book of fiction, if you're a nonbeliever.If you believe in UFO's and monsters, the interviews with the people sound very sincere and convincing.If you don't believe in the subject, the book reads like a good horror novel with a tragic ending which is based on a true event
__label__1	"Interesting, but read the fine print....: Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: ""This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously."" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a ""true event"" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the ""author's imagination."" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."
__label__1	POOR QUALITY INCORRECT: the item that is stated does not look like the stock graphics , the picture that is show is not what the item looks like . dont count on a good quality product
__label__2	Great for the price!: We love the flatware, due to the design. Attractive and dishwasher safe, but not too sturdy.
__label__1	cheap: This flatware set is very pretty, but made very cheap. After several months of use, the ends became loose and several of them actually fell out. A complete and total waste of money.
__label__2	Awesome.: What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Nothing. Awesome album on every level.
__label__1	"Why Can't I Rate at Zero Stars ?: Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
__label__1	Sound Catchy but mix with Terrorists: I have to agree some songs sound very catchy.But isn't she singing about some Terrorist Group in some Asian Island? I heard even MTV ban some of her songs because of that.
__label__1	surprised: she's sri lankan but it's like she's trying to be west indian or something. Ok it kind of works and she's really pretty but I think she would become even bigger if she marketed herself to bollywood and gave the music the dancehall sound. It would give her some nice exposure.
__label__1	"OK: You can tell the difference between this and the next. A couple of good songs, nothing spectacular. One song on this CD appears on the movie ""War"" with Jet-Li. Although I rate this with an OK, Im very tough. There's no sappy love ballads, no whiney boy songs. It's in your face, and strong."
__label__1	A Question: Can someone please tell me how she managed to be signed by A!!!!record label, let alone one capable of putting her music (if that's what you call it) into the airwaves as much as it is.
__label__1	Terrible. Just terrible.: People must really be desperate these days. Just because pretentious jerks who write bad music reviews for Rolling Stone and Pitchfork say this is good, doesnt mean it'll make you super-cool if you say you like it too. M.I.A. is HORRIBLE.
__label__1	Stop while you're ahead!: Save your money or purchase a hammer when you buy this cd because all you'll want to do is hit yourself in the head for buying it in the first place. If not for that then you'll be hitting yourself just so you don't have to hear this woman's whinney voice, trust me. I bought this album just a few days ago and all I can say is..Well, you get the point..
__label__1	ZZZZZZZZZZ.....snooze-fest: Great, another socially aware electro-dance record. I can't wait for the an Iraqi to come out with one about the current US led invasion.
__label__2	"If this doesn't get you dancing, you have no pulse!: The single, ""Galang"" explodes like computerized firebombs! All quaking synths and bells and whistles and a beat that would get the dead to dance. Those who are expecting more run-of-the-mill ""crunky"" R&B can look elsewhere for that dreck. The album's combination of dancehall, Brazilian funk, grime and house with M.I.A.'s chirpy, sexy raps is hands down one of the best albums of the year. Own it now!!!"
__label__2	She's A Paradigm in the Making.: If you don't believe in her politics, listen to the music - we can't all be John Lennon. But we could aspire to be Public Enemy - different genre, same ethos. With her minimalist approach, she jettisons a rapid-fire selection of rage, humour, politics [sometimes muddled and confusing], sex...but always arresting and thought provoking. Online pugilists argue the terrorist/Tamil revolutionary ties via her father, and while it's an important salient subject to spelunk, weaving the politico with the dance floor is an exhilarating art I can't overlook based on that writ - Madonna could learn a thing or two about juxtaposing them creatively [see American Life]. My grade: A
__label__1	Gets old fast: The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. The novelty wore off after the first play through and it soon went from quick, quirky, and interesting to obnoxious, and boring. Perhaps this just isn't my style of music but I heard a lot of good things about this album and figured I'd give it a try. I found myself enjoying her biography a lot more than her album.
__label__2	"Get your heart beating: Mmmmmm hmmmmmm, wickedly wild. I've never been into dance music much but damn, I danced, and had fun while doing it. Not to mention I'm a sucker for politicly driven albums and it was an extra good year with both ted leo and now this. Standout tracks are definetely ""Amazon"" ""Bingo"" ""Pull Up The People"" ""Sunshowers"".....f it, any track is a standout track."
__label__2	brilliant raggamuffin: I don't care about all the hype, I dig this record a lot. I play it, then I play it again. it's almost always in my head. I wish I had four more of her records. the performance is very loose and the production is really tight. rollicking, rowdy, catchy as hell. she's got a great spark.
__label__2	Captivated by Arular: My 10 year old daughter and my 61 year old butt can't get enough of Arular. Masterfully edited - as tight and rich as the Beatles at their peak. The dad loves the mechanical electronic aspects. The girl has to sing along with the singsong poetry and just dance to it.Maya's voice is awesome. My brother's reaction was that he doesn't like foreigh sounding funny voices in his music, so this isn't for everyone. But it's not just for open minded college students. This is the real thing. This is a most favored treat in our huge and eclectic music collection.As with other reviewers, we, too, are put off by the violent images, but for us it has the authentic feel of a window into the revolutionary third world.
__label__2	Too good for Sepos: This album is innovative and fun, blending various styles to create one slick and catchy sound. It is a refreshing change to bland Strokes-wannabies and the same old homogenised Fiddy/G-Unit output and what a surprise you Yanks don't seem to understand or appreciate it! I've even read reviews on here criticising her accent - SHE'S FOREIGN WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? I've read other reviews attacking her political agenda - WHAT DO FIDDY AND HIS GOONS RAP ABOUT??? Guns, Beatches and Drugs that's what!!!! At least MIA has something intelligent to say. Isn't freedom of speech a constitutional right for you guys anyway??? Open your ears and your wallet and buy a copy now!!!
__label__2	It'll get in your head ...: I saw the video for Galang on BPM and was laughing out loud. This skinny little Sri Lankan girl was spitting out london ghetto rap while dancing crazily in front of a cartoon backdrop. But the next few days, something about the beat stayed in my head. I had to hear it again. I did, and I taped it, and the more I listened to it the more I realized I wanted to hear more. I found it at a store and bought it. On the bus ride home I didn't much care for it, but like the Galang video, it stayed in my head. Everytime I listened to it I liked it a little bit more. It's like watching Pulp Fiction, each time you see it, something appears to you that you missed before that makes the whole thing make more and more sense. By now, it is one of my favourite CD's and I don't even listen to this genre (if it even fits into any genre) regularly. It isn't for everyone, but if you have a good subwoofer and an open mind for something unique...give it a shot.
__label__2	blows you up before you go...: Probably the most best album that will be released this decade. It has great significance in a post-9/11 world. M.I.A. has no qualms about mentioning bombs, guns, terrorists and racism in her songs. Every track stands out, the previous release tracks 'Sunshowers' and 'Galang,' probably some of the best tracks of 2004, are overshadowed by 'Pull Up The People' and 'Bucky Done Gun.'M.I.A. is truly is TuPac of the third-world.
__label__1	bloody awful: sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack factory. if this music is so revolutionary and worldly, how come the only people listening to it are skinny white boys who wear hats with earflaps indoors?
__label__2	"MIA: Hip Hop's Nice, Nice Fighter: She's ""got the beats to make ya burn"" - This is the future of Hip Hop. These 10 songs (plus a ""hidden"" bonus track) are fascinating and fun. The ""extra"" re-release track ""U.R.A.Q.T."" samples the theme of TV's ""Sanford & Son"". My favorite tracks are ""Hombre"", ""10 Dollar"", and the steel-drum laden ""Bingo""."
__label__2	"rhythmic, textured, danceable electronic music: i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn't. i guess reading through the reviews here says the same thing: this doesn't try to be the kind of music my mother would like (or some of my coworkers). but that must be obvious if you listen to the samples amazon provide.but otherwise, this is pretty sweet - it strikes a nice balance between playing with new ideas/sounds on the one hand and keeping a steady groove on the other. ""commerical experimental"" in a good way - and i think that's a very challenging target.as for the politics and trying to second guess whether this woman is ""for real"" - it doesn't matter unless you don't like the music. good music doesn't need to (and usually doesn't) match my politics. why on earth should it? if you don't like the music, fair enough. but to argue that you don't like music because of the attitude or the politics - what's with that? you're confusing music with something else, i think."
__label__2	this girl can spit!: i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff
__label__2	M.I.A. announces her arrival. Moving around is compulsory: A DJ aquaintance of mine told me that 'Arular' always got the crowd up and dancing, and in a way, I can see why. Central to this electronic beatfest is M.I.A's sassy vocals, falling somewhere in between Madonna and Lene Lovich (the Neneh Cherry comparison is pretty good) all within the framework of hip-hop rhyming. There's really no need to over-analyze the music, which is basically infectious stripped-down beats, eg, LCD Soundsystem, pulsating, raw and tribal, almost hailing back to the crushing barebones approach of early hip-hop, eg, Grandmaster Flash. Also thrown into the mix is a subtle yet ecclectic fusion of analog flash, dancehall, and world music. But basically the appeal of 'Arular' stems from the charm and sexuality of M.I.A's vocals, orgasmic shrieks and brassy chants, a female touch when one expects male vocals to compliment the rhythmic thunder. Here she is now, let M.I.A. entertain you.
__label__1	"Milli Vanilli redux: With the exception of lip-synching, this is an exact replay of Milli Vanilli. Remember that moment? Watching the Milli Vanilli video and saying, ""Huh, cool hair, uh, sorta interesting street scenes...wow, this music is really bad."" That's MIA: long on concept, trend, style and buzzwords; short on music. Does the world really need another dressed-up exotic with no discernable musical talent who can mouth a few political half-phrases? You be the judge. Vote with your wallet.p.s. anybody wanna buy a used copy? If not I'm using it for a coaster."
__label__1	M.I.A.: This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol.
__label__1	"Anyone notice terrorist references?: This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics.For instance, Sunshowers:""You wanna win a war? Like PLO I don't surrender""""It's a bomb yo, so run yo, put away your stupid gun yo... that's why we blow it up before we go""""they showed him a picture then, ain't that you with the muslims?""Now I'm not one for censorship, but I can't back someone glorifying PLO and terrorism in dance music. That's just ridiculous. I know reggae has roots of being somewhat violent and rebellious back at its early roots, but I absolutely can't sponsor these messages. It's just wrong."
__label__1	M.I.A.- No Way!: If this CD were to be captured- it would not be an M.I.A. that you would go looking for. Save your money and buy a 99 cent toy flute at Walmart to make better music.
__label__1	Save your money... Don't believe the hype.: I heard a lot of chatter about this new girl M.I.A. and her album getting a lot of good reviews. I don't know if her phenomenon is a result of her label hyping her in publications or what, but after listening to her album once through, I would advise you to stay away unless ecstasy-rave music is your thing. She is nearly unintelligible on all of her vocals and is drowned out by the incessant reverb present on all most all of her tracks. This is the definition of drivel. I am happy for her and her interesting life story, but her music does not interest me. Save your $!
__label__1	"terrible... absolutely terrible: This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."
__label__1	no: just no. not even close to being listenable. its as annoying as listening to japanese anime before its been dubbed.
__label__1	WTF????????: This album is able to be previewed in full on NME.com If I were you I would go there to find out just what you're about to endure. This album sucks extremely bad. I have not heard anything this half assed in all but two weeks. This garbage getting good reviews is only an indication of the white reviewers out there trying to make this seem cooler than it isn'nt. The beats are exactly the same on every track. Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record. This is what bad pop music will sound like in ten years. MIA has recorded a travesty ahead of her time. Once again, go to NME.com and preview this before you actully waste your money on this. The sound of this record could have been reproduced with a kettle drum and sticks banging together in a long hall.
__label__2	If you like dancehall ... get this: 1. M.I.A. is a Philly rapper, they are always the best, new york and L.A. are always deporting philly rappers to be on their labels.2. I suggest this album if you like dancehall, its a lot like it, but because there is a mix of dancehall, soka, rap, and indian, its amazing. Reminds me of reggage heat 03 and 04.
__label__2	M.I.A. rocks the house.: This album is highly ranked in the metacritics for a very good reason. It's great! If you want to hear fresh and new ways to mix hiphop lyrics and dance sounds you'll love it. Don't listen to anyone who rates this album poorly, it's a top ten of 2005 for sure.
__label__1	Dishes chip VERY easily: I bought 10 place settings of these dishes because I like the style. However, after owning them for less than a year several of the dinner plates, salad plates, bowls and mugs have chips on the rim. They look terrible because when the graphite color is chipped it is very noticeable since the stoneware underneath is white. I am not hard on dishes and load them into the dishwasher myself. I owned my previous set of Dansk dishes from nearly 11 years and replaced them only to update the style. I contacted the company with my complaint but they simply said the chips are from banging them against another hard surface...not true. Dishes at this price point should be of high enough quality to withstand being washed in a dishwasher. As I said, I am the only one who handles them. I am embarrased to use these dishes and disappointed in Noritakes response.
__label__1	"Nice but shows scratches.: I fell in love with these great dishes but I am dissapointed that they need to be replaced within a few years. They were our wedding set and I wish they didn't look awful. We only use them for family meals and use my husband's everyday Johnson Bros. dishes that are 50 years old! They look great. Too Bad the quality isn't like it used to be... unless we just got a ""bad batch"" although they were purchased from different stores where we registered... Nice to set the table with but will scratch unless your family uses plastic tableware. We don't."
__label__2	How to beat the gray marks: I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. I have discovered that the right dishwasher detergent takes care of this. I was using a phosphate-free powder, for ecological reasons, but it was not getting my dishes clean. Researching this, I learned that in the last year, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents have improved a lot, so this problem may go away by itself. Otherwise, try a different phosphate-free detergent; the tablets seem to work best.
__label__1	Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting: I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware.
__label__2	Excellent Everyday China: I bought my Colorwave Graphite dishes at Macy's, not Amazon.com, but after reading the mixed reviews for these dishes I decided to add my own comments. I am very pleased with these dishes, and I cannot understand why anyone wouldn't be. After two years of daily use they are still without chips and show very little wear. They do show some scratches, but they are not fine china, they're everyday china. For the money, and for everyday use, I can't think of a better set of dishes to own. The lines are simple and casual, and they look nice in any setting. I can very happily recommend them.
__label__1	"Great story sorriest printing and binding Ive ever witnessed: The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks. I can't believe this isnt a joke. Hopefully I can get a refund and order the book from a reputable publisher later. If you buy a paperback from anyone make dang sure it isnt an ""Instabook"""
__label__2	All Barsoom books are great!: I first read the Martian Chronicles as a teenager. They are in fact the only sci-fi I've ever read. What I want to know is why George Lucas or Steven Spielberg havn't made movies of them? With their abilities in the sci-fi world they could do a great job with them.
__label__2	"Brilliant, Lagwagon's most ""complex"" album: The CD will not grab you at first, its not as catchy as Lagwagon's previous releases, but with a few listens it makes the argument for greatest Lag album ever. The flow through out the whole thing is perfect. The CD is dedicated to Derrick (the bands original drummer) and with that comes a lot of emotion, dealing a lot with reflection, moving on, and self-discovery, the lyrics here are very well crafted. I absolutly cannot stop listening to this record. It's got so much to offer. The highlights of the album for me ""Runs in the Family"", ""The Controtionist"" and ""Days of New"", which will most likley give you the chills if youre a die hard lagwagon fan.I truly belive that Joey Cape is one on the most incedible song writers of the past couple decades. Listen to Lagwagon along with his side project Bad Astronaut and you have the makings of a musical genious. Cant wait for the upcoming tour! Keep making music guys!"
__label__2	very good: This is a great cd. It takes a few times listening to it to start enjoying it,then it sounds like a new,but familiar lagwagon. This one was dedicated to Derrick Plourde, their original drummer that played the blistering drums on duh,trashed, and hoss. He committed suicide in 2005. This album is very well written,even though it only took them 2 weeks to write the songs. This album is definately up there in their top 5 albums.
__label__2	Bernie sings too !: Be sure, this is a nice CD from long years ago....but especially for elton john fans
__label__2	Who said Bernie cant sing?: This is Bernie Taupin's second solo album and it is excellent.From the rockers Born on the fourth of July to his smooth ballads Venezuela and Love(the barren desert). This is a great album for anyone who has followed Elton and Bernie's career.
__label__2	Maximum Minimalist Soundscapes Unfold: If you like Math Rock/Instrumental Indie Rock i.e: Paul Newman, Tortoise, Don Cabellero, Dianogah, Triseza, Godspeed you Black Emperor than this is highly recommended. No Vocals just pure melodic builds and peaks. Really good deep Bass lines and fantastic drumming.
__label__2	In depth study: This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer.
__label__2	"A Good Album: I have been a fan of Nightwish ever since I was first introduced to the amazing world of gothic rock/operatic rock music through Evanescence (if you like this band, then you may like this band). The first album of theirs I bought was their greatest hits album, ""Highest Hopes"". I have since been adding their previous albums to my ever-growing collection of gothic rock CD's. I am faithful to the Tarja days...not the newer singer. I believe ""Wishmaster"" is a good album and is an essential addition for fans of Nightwish, as well as the albums ""Once"", ""Oceanborn"" and ""Century Child"". I do love all of the songs from ""Wishmaster"" that are also found on ""Highest Hopes"". I can listen to this album straight through without skipping any songs. To me, however, ""Once"" is the ""Holy Grail"" of all the Nightwish albums,which would earn five stars...5.5 if it was possible."
__label__1	2/5: This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. I hardly enjoy listening to this album.I hardly recommend this album. Addy.
__label__1	Cheese enthroned: This is like a new genre of music - cheese metal, it sucks so bad that you don't even get angry with it, rather you feel sorry for the poor people in this god-awful band, and all the people who were misled into buying this or any other nightwish cd. The sound is like total cheesy motoristic rock with ridicules dickenson-like vocals distorted in the worst possible way...Ok if i had to pick one cd i would suggest you NOT to buy, this would come in second only to limp bizkit's chocolate starfish.......
__label__1	FORMULATIC AND HEARTLESS: THis band from Scandinavia reminds me of Stratovarius. They sound so clean, so perfect, that you almost forget they are playing rock. It's boring and flat sound, and the female singer is annoying with his boring voice. It's a totally forgetable experience.
__label__2	overated?!: I dont know how you can say this cd is overated, it is underated if anything. This is brilliant group of musicians, who all have talent on their insturments that really shines through and compliments the group as a whole. This cd overall is awesome, not a bad track from start to finish. My favorite part about this cd (being a guitar player) is the guitar solos, this guy really knows how to craft the perfect solo to compliment the track, unlike most metal guitarists who just try to play as fast as they can and end up killing the mood of the track. If your looking for a truly awesome melodic/power/prog metal experience look no further. m/
__label__2	A MUST HAVE: When I purchased this cd I had already listened to some songs on it and I liked them very much, so I bought the cd thinking that those were going to be the only ones on the cd that were good BUT when I bought the cd I could not belive how good each and every song was on the cd. Now I am one that likes bands like Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, Blind Guardian, Dark Tranquility, Iced Earth, Helloween,Iron Maiden, and let me tell you this cd is one of the best Ive heard and if you like good metal with good melody in it then this is most deffinitely a must have in your collection cd!!!!
__label__2	Great: Insert the CD and listen to the first track. This is everything Nightwish is known for. Any fan will love this album
__label__2	It all sounds the same, but...: It's all good. This album suffers from a common problem among metal albums in that almost all the songs sound very similar, but in this case it just doesn't matter because it's all enjoyable. From the haunting vocals to the masterful pacing of the instrumentals, every song on here is actually fairly inspiring to listen to, cliché as those descriptions sound. Definitely worth a buy.
__label__2	Great: Wishmaster is a fantastic album, that should grace everyone's music collection. Innovating and always refreshing. Truly a masterpiece.
__label__2	Spine Chilling, Awesome, and Grand!: I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. If I had to chose one CD to be stranded with on a desert island, this is it! All Nighwish is good but this is there greatest, and most epic. Tarja has the most amazing voice, and makes this metal in a catagory all it's own. You have just got to hear it, I can explain the way this album can make you feel. The classical of the future!
__label__2	finlands power: one of finlands best kept secrets.this cd is full of power. tarja turunen vocals are just stunning.from the haunting song a dead boys poem to the powerfull she is my sin and crownless this cd is for any one who is into great euro metal a must.
__label__2	"Very good, stunning !: The great differential in this metal band from Finland is the presence of a female singer. Other than this, the keyboarder writes all the songs, which is also unusual in a metal band. Because NIGHTWISH is metal, sheer European metal, but with style and precision. There's no great concern with fast guitar solos, just good music being played. But this CD shows clearly that they have evoluted. This is much better than "" ANGELS FALL FIRST""."
__label__1	L T: Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me .
__label__1	interesting, but...: it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!
__label__2	Wishmaster: I play this cd over and over again. I use this when I'm going for long walks and te time just fly!
__label__2	Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva: Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite découvrir le métal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. À tous le monde cest un must buy.
__label__2	"Nanci Griffiths ""Other Voices Other Rooms "" A great Video: I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing ""Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather"". Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand"
__label__2	Please Release on DVD: This was a wonderful concert celebrating a landmark album from Nanci Griffith. The guest artists were superb. Please release on DVD !!
__label__2	Welch Allyn thermometer: My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more, but is very accurate, easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice, but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings.
__label__2	Simple to use: I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended.
__label__2	Peace of Mind: I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind.
__label__2	Just like the hospital and doc's clinic: I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature. I just decided to purchase this one, the same one used by my hospital and personal doc. So happy to have peace of mind.
__label__1	Awful. Too many typos to even read!!!!!!: With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this.
__label__1	Broke in less then a month: I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month.
__label__1	rocket science: I cannot wait to return this item to Babies R Us. I tried to assemble it at home and the only thing I succeeded in was amusing my daughter. It's not easy to put together at all!
__label__1	Not worth the money: I would not recommend this product.Tents are lots of fun for all kids, HOWEVER this tent is NOT just a pop-up tent. It take some time to set up and the poles are not durable or safe.My kids have used it for two days, and the wooden poles that hold up the tent split down the middle.I had to tape them back together and I, myself have gotten a deep splinter.For the amount of money I spent on this item I would have expected better quality.I would not recommend this product as a play item.
__label__1	BORING...: The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD.
__label__2	A Great Documentary: this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
__label__1	"This may be a shortened version of ""Howlin' Wolf Live Gold"": This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
__label__2	Such Great Music!: It took me forever to finally get this gem, but it was so worth the wait. Some of the best music I've ever heard. They had it all! Wouldn't it be great for them to get together again?! I just wonder if they really know just how good they were and how much they are missed.
__label__2	Great listening and worth every penny: John Townsend is the man with the voice, and it might be one of the finest vocal performances ever. If you don't believe it, just sit back and listen to this album from start to finish. The lyrics are interesting and fun and the performance is outstanding.
__label__2	When Will Another CD Be Released?: When you think of all the material that has been released out on CD. Why is this not available in North America. C'mon Warner!
__label__2	A Winner!: One of my all-time favorites in a listening history that ranges from the Beatles and Motown in the 60's to the present. I can still listen to it over and over and over...It never gets old.
__label__2	"Chris LaMach: Chris LaMach. Chris was my next door neighbor on 13th floor of Neumaier hall at Moorhead State University in 1977. Chris's favorite album was ""Smoke From a Distant Fire"" from the Sandford and Townsend Band. I listened to it so much when I was in college in Chris's room that I learned each one of the ten songs by heart. Try listening to the ending fugue of ""Squire James"" at 3 a.m. sometime when you've been up all night partying - it was enough to make you rethink your misspent youth. The lyrics of this album are sometimes repetitive and simplistic. For example, count the number of times the themes of smoke, fire, burning, etc. appear throughout the album. Also, the dreadful refrain of ""I've got ants in my pants and I just might dance all night"" in the otherwise terrific ""Shake It to the Right"" come to mind. But these are small criticisms. The bass line is dynamic, the vocals powerful and the songs are extremely catchy and long wearing. Just whatever happened to these guys?"
__label__2	good stuff: although there is actually only one hit on this CD, if youre from this time the memories are worth it all.
__label__2	"A Classic.: Many thanks to Collector's Choice for reissuing this magnificent album on CD, previously only available on disc in the fine but expensive and rare Japanese pressing.""Smoke From A Distant Fire"" is one of a few dozen tunes that instantly, for those of us in our late 30s/early 40s, takes you back to the great days of AM gold. And, the good part, it's not the only catchy, likeable tune on the record.In a time when almost anything seems to qualify as ""a classic"", this duo and these tunes really are."
__label__1	NOT a review of the music -- just Amazon: iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well.
__label__2	a good book: This technology module contains a brief introductory description to the exchanger type above, followed by information on construction, construction materials, operating limitsand principal applications. Where appropriate, a comparison is made with conventionalshell and tube heat exchangers to emphasise size and weight reductions that can beachieved by using compact heat exchangers.The Module 3 series present further information applicable to all technologies, such asgeneral advantages and limitations of compact exchanger designs, common applications,fouling and how to minimise it, energy efficiency. heat transfer enhancement, exchangerselection, specification and operation, process intensification and software programmes.
__label__2	Excellent Introduction: This, along withThe Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity, provides and excellent introduction to Wiccan concepts of divinity. Both books are well researched and as complete as can be expected given the enormity of the subject.
__label__2	overall a good book.: Props to Will Connelly. I found it real researchable, very good to find, and overall the book I must find. I love it. It gives tips on rehearsing, what studio to built or to use, what type'a of equipment you must use or have, I mean it gives everything out from chapter to chapter.It also includes bibliography and recommendations you must read and know about. Good information.
__label__2	I love it: I just love PUR, they have great songs. I am glad that I could get them here in the US. I am German, so I do understand all the words, what makes a different too. Danke, PUR, fuer Eure grossartige Musik.
__label__2	"Seiltanzertraum: If you have lived in Germany, you would have heard about PUR. Their music is catchy with great lyrics and very easy to listen to - even my children (young and do not speak German) love the music. You do not have to understand a word of German to enjoy this CD and any one of their CD's. Best track in my opinion on this CD has got to be "" Hor Gut Zu"""
__label__2	Not so hidden fantasies explored and discovered ...: Written by one of America's hottest contemporary erotica writers the author takes us on a real life tour of her private world of sex slaves, swinging and BDSM. In contrast to most readers pre conceived notions where the `sadism' part of BDSM lifestyle is usually a description of a master beating the living daylights out of his slave, Maria Isabel Pita describes her relationship with her master as a pretty well wholesome practice of living out her fantasies ......Yes there are rules and considerations to a good relationship and the results can only be understated as very very satisfying. Being a master erotica writer the author manages to describe her life in a manner that takes the reader on a delicious and vicarious trip into a world that generally are only deep and hidden fantasies of most women ....This real life exploration of a sex slave/master relationship make these fantasies not only seem more plausible but also delicious .....
__label__1	Where was the editor?: Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues).
__label__1	"Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can't.: I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
__label__2	THE HARMONIOUS HOLLIES: This self-titled effort from the British band offers their masterful harmonies on an eleven track album.The trio of Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester share most of the compositions, with the exception of the album's biggest hit, THE AIR THAT I BREATHE, written by Albert Hammond.The only real misstep is the obvious LONG COOL WOMAN clone, THE DAY CURLY BILLY SHOT DOWN CRAZY SAM MCGEE, which even copies LCW's opening guitar riff. However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN. Ballad-wise, DON'T LET ME DOWN is sharp and the 50ish doo-wop sound of LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND is a nice change of pace.Overall, an enjoyableslice of 70s pop.
__label__2	Listen to it more than once: I didn't think much of this album when I first got it and listened to it, but after a couple of listens, I really liked it. In fact, it's probably one of my favourite Hollies albums. I usually listen to my music on my ipod or my itunes on shuffle, and whenever I hear a Hollies song that I don't really know but I really like what I hear, it's usually from this album. So I would definitely recommend it even if you are not a hard-core Hollies fan!!
__label__2	"Pop power from 1974: Amazon's review is wrong; this 1974 LP often gets confused with their 1965 LP, mainly because they are both simply titled ""Hollies"". This one is the band's reunion LP with Allan Clarke, and is one of their best from the '70s, with delightful tunes such ""Falling Calling"" and ""Down on the Run"", both featuring harmonica. Why this LP only generated one hit, ""The Air that I Breathe"" is a mystery; everything here is equally commercial-sounding. Unfortunately, the happy atmosphere here was short-lived, as the albums that followed were workmanlike affairs, with a general lack of musical direction. No matter; The Hollies are one of the great pop bands, and this is one of their best moments."
__label__1	Beware of packaging: Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point.
__label__2	"Unlike the First: Celtic music has always been one of my favorite genres of music. After listening to Enam's first CD for years, I finally was able to listen to his second CD and was moved. His sophisticated touch to his songs have risen to another level and was taken by surprise. Compared to his first CD, his music has become more ""emotional"" and deep to the point that it reaches the heart. The varieties of instruments have not changed and the soundscape of his work is simply moving."
__label__2	Purple and Gold: I love this album. Just when you think you've heard everything in the Celtic meme, along comes a CD like this that is new and exciting.
__label__1	Ha Ha Ha: Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!
__label__2	Essential Step in PE Preparation: This sample test provides the look and feel of the actual PE exam.Amazon, I love your company, but your price can't compete in this case (almost $200 as I write this). I purchased this same book on the NCEES website for a small fraction of the price you charge here (around $40 plus shipping).
__label__2	"Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011): Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website."
__label__2	Works like a charm: I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5'er. The came on time, were well packaged, and work exactly as they should work. I had a tiny leak in one of the originals, and so replaced the pair. Very happy with the results.
__label__1	I couldn't get into it: I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style.
__label__1	Not complimentary.: This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down.
__label__2	Beautiful, Poetic, Distinctive Writing: I loved this book. This is the first Kincaid novel that I've read and I really dig the author's repetitive style of writing. I could definitely identify with the main theme of the book, having lost my own mother as a teenager. You go through life looking for that type of love, always coming up short because nothing comprable exists to the love of a mother who truly loves her children.You blindly search for womanhood, without the guidance from what could have been your most instrumental teacher. I would absolutely recommend this work to any young woman who has lost her mother, through death or otherwise. I cannot wait to get started on my next Kincaid novel.
__label__2	"The autobiography of ""EVERY"" Caribbean mother.: Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native, she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel, the mother's character, at parts, seemed much like my own mother: Having a dream of a better existence, but having it crushed by a woman whose dreams have also been diminished. And thus, a vicious cycle within a society of women who never seem to truly live; instead, only exist to raise other crushed little girls to yield even more unfulfilled woman.Don't look for any made-up or whimsical fantasies here. You will find yourself precisely where little secrets lie. . .in places you will only visit by way of Kincaid's chariot."
__label__1	Not my kind of read: I found the book to be uneasy reading. I am widely read, but try as I might, I had to quit reading about 1/2 way through.
__label__1	Disappointing: I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life. I was left wondering what these aspects of the book had to do with the character's mother.
__label__1	A fast, but mostly unpleasant read: This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing.
__label__1	"Puzzling: After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
__label__1	The autobiography of my mother: Did not really get lost in there book....found it boring....and I really wanted to stop reading it! But chose to painstakingly finish it..
__label__1	The autobiography of my mother: It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.
__label__1	repetitive: This book has flowery language and the story line seems to have potential but the book never goes any where. I skimmed much of it, hoping it would develop plot and character, but it really never did. The plot and language were repetitive and didn't hold my attention. It seemed as though the author had a point she was trying hard to get to but it just never happened.
__label__2	"Incredible: This is my favorite of Jamaica Kincaid's, which of course is saying a lot. It is simply amazing. More complex and involved than her usual writing, it is a ""hard"" read, but definitely worth it. Also, if you ever have a chance to hear her read, it is amazing, and you will never read her in the same way again."
__label__1	Too much self absorption: The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind.
__label__2	a must read: this Book takes you on a journey for knowledge and understanding. it speaks to gaining something that is powerful that will be a stepping stone for better days and times ahead. this Book deals with expierences and coming to terms with life and how it has been dealt and the choices that you have to make.alot of issues and challenges are met head on and dealt with. very strong and well written book.
__label__1	Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink.: What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work
__label__1	"Do I have to give it a star?: Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
__label__1	Sharks Walnut picture frame with emblem: I ordered this item for a Xmas gift, however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit, the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit. However you could not see this in looking at the product only when you tried to fit the picture and matting together in the frame.Very disappointed in this item and would not order anything made by the Memory Company again. I have also contacted the Memory Company who makes this frame to see what their response will be.
__label__1	Don't buy this book: Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book.
__label__2	Poly tape: Does a great job highly visible. Works well with the different fencers that I use in the different pastures. Last a long time. Can't beat it for the price.
__label__1	"disappointing, confusing, not an good intro to snmp: This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
__label__1	This is a fuzzy description of SNMP: I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain.
__label__1	"Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too!: The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
__label__1	Not just disappointed, angered.: It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames.
__label__1	Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference: I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free.
__label__1	Disappointing that Amazon's Price is 15.00 more than at B&N: Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally
__label__2	The finale of the Icerigger series.: The finale of the Icerigger series does not have quite the adventure of the other two and harbors a pretty silly villain and plot. None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran. There is definitely something wonderful and personal about this series. The characters are very rich and you really want to know more about them and share in their adventures.
__label__2	St. Rose of Lima: This is a great book for children doing research about Saints, especially particular Saints such as the first female saint of the Americas. A little pricey for the book, 6.00 would incld. ship would be a better purchase.
__label__2	Totally Cool blend of Rap vocal and funky jazz instrumental: A new wave. The strongest part that brings you back, is the creative flair of the music. The music can stand by itself. Just really cool, float me away.
__label__2	solid value: I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. Good quality and a fair price.
__label__1	poetic but excessive: I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels.
__label__2	Wonderful app: I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this
__label__2	Very good: This is the only magazine I read regularly in college (25 years ago) that I still read now. Great articles on all kinds of issues and they do try to cater to black women from ages 20 to 55 or so which is not easy. Lately, it's been a little flat -- both in terms of magazine size and in the depth of the articles. I'm renewing it one more year and hope it improves during that time
__label__1	Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!!!!!: I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women.
__label__2	Essence: I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day.
__label__1	WHERE IS THE MAGAZINE????????????????: I orderd this magazine in August... There should be some type of notation telling customers that it takes up to two months or more befoee the first issue will arrive.......What a waste of time. I could have gone to the library and received this magazine for free to read......I am still wating..... and there is no tracking number, therefore you just don't have a clear date for the arrival of the magazine.......not happy right now,,,,,,
__label__1	where my copy: Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. I feel like I calomst could have done better by going to the store and buying it. I have yet to get my first copy of the magazine
__label__1	too many ads, not enough interesting material: i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention.
__label__1	Could Easily break a tooth: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.
__label__1	"Zero Resolution: I'm sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. It's almost as though the author got bored and quit - Zero resolution on anything. It doesn't leave me wanting more because I know the same feeling of ""What the Hell?"" will be waiting for me in the next book."
__label__2	Simply the Best!: I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember reading Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best author I've ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn't let go until he's done what he wants to.I too was very Wary of the title, but I've found I'm not thinking about Frankenstein when I'm reading this, I'm just too engrossed in the characters! I can not wait until book two and I am so glad he wrote this instead of following through with making it a movie as he mentions in the begining of the book.
__label__2	like the critics say: RIVETING!: the book was great. i can't wait for the next one. definitely captivating.
__label__2	"A Page-Turner Modern Day Frankenstein: Bought this book as someone loaned me the next two in the series. I read them all within 2 weeks because I needed to see what was coming next, and it was hard to put them down. I hope to hear more about Deucalion's ""adventures""."
__label__1	Ok but nothing great: Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series.
__label__1	Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it.
__label__2	Excellent as always: I've been a fan of Mr Koontz for a long time. This book is on par with his best works and I'm hoping to read the rest of the series soon.
__label__1	Give me an ending: A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone.
__label__1	Disappointing!: The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away.
__label__1	"It's Garbage.: Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
__label__1	"Just God Awful: Koontz turns the Frankenstein mythos into a cop story. The single, hot, emotionally distant cop...her laugh a minute partner who secretly loves her...the gruff rival detectives with questionable motives... No cliche is left unturned. The most interesting character...the first monster...gets the least ""screen time"". And the ending?This was just awful."
__label__1	Not Dean Koontz's best: This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. Not up to Mr. Koontz's standard of edge of your seat, nail biting suspense I've come to love.
__label__2	This book is has inspired me: This book would probably have to be the best work of fiction I have ever read, and I have read a lot of fiction. Short chapters, follows all of the characters so you have every aspect of the story line. Very interesting and just up my ally, hits very close to home. I connect with Victor very much in some aspects. After reading this book, you almost want to start experimenting with reanimation, and see where it goes...or maybe thats just me. Very good book though.
__label__2	Stunning Craftmanship: Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son is one of Dean Koontz's best novels. It is fast-paced, full of action and suspense, and the characters are ones you become attached to. Definitely a page turner...I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves a suspenseful thriller. Warning: Once you've read this, you'll have to read #2...and if you liked it as much as I did, you'll probably end up angry that #3 isn't out yet. Can't wait!
__label__2	Koontz nailed it!: I'd only read the first three Odd Thomas books of Koontz's, but thought I'd try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. And, it wasn't. It's a refreshing twist on the resurfacing of the madman (he was never destroyed, and actually resents that Shelley woman's story), but with a clean dash of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a pinch of James Lee Burke's detective angle, all with a flavor of hi-test horror. I'm starting on Vol 2 tonight!
__label__2	D Koontzs books: Was looking for the Frankenstein series. I found the first three books. they were brand new and arrived in good time.
__label__1	Frankenstein Prodigal Son: I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this book. The character Decaulion was boring. I didn't think much of the ending (I don't want to give it away). Usually I'm surprised by the ending, or satisfied. A predictable conclusion.
__label__2	Reviews, not plot summaries: This forum is for your opinion of the book, not for each of you to explain the plot over and over again. That's already done above.
__label__1	Don't bother: Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book.
__label__1	A good story but not great: I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite. In fact I was rather unhappy with the whole book. Now don't get me wrong he is a great writer but this book bored me. I don't read to get bored.
__label__2	A Frankenstein for our Generation: This is my first Dean Koontz novel and it will surely not be my last.Frankenstein, Book one: Prodigal Son is a refreshing tale of what happens when the man becomes the monster and the monster becomes the man. Mix that in with a few serial killers, clones and a unlikely partenrship. Think James Paterson meets Mary Shelly.Already on Book 2 can't wait to see what happens next.
__label__2	Gripping: I haven't been this taken with a book since the Harry Potter series. From the Prelude I was enthralled. Wonderful, strong characters and a storyline that makes putting the book down wrenching.
__label__2	I finished book one of Koontz`s Frankenstein.: I have to say, I'm a bit surprised it took me so long to get to this series, being the fan I am ... now im excited to have another great series ahead of me. A very convincing, modern take on the madness of Victor Frankenstein. Worth every minute.
__label__1	Neat package but very grainy indoor quality: Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc.
__label__1	Horrible motor noise: Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see...
__label__1	"always ""remove the tape"" message: I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. ""remove the tape"" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder."
__label__1	"Awful Company. Awful Product. Run! Run! Run!: Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on ""zr40 tape problems"" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers."
__label__1	Zr40 Cannon: The camcorder was little dirty, and had a missing lens cover...Joanne did not have the missing cover and did not know why it was dirty...The power cord was defective...ordered a new one...Looked like it was chewed into...The case (cassette) compartment was slightly bent and unable to open at first...made some adjustments to it...Fred
__label__1	Worst Product I have Owned: As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100. The Canon is going in the trash.
__label__1	Eats tapes: After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy.
__label__1	Sent mine back the next day: I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun was quickly over. Low light recording (in my apartment with lights on) was horrible and even with low-light mode selected, it was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better. I would seriously hold out for a better camera, even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike.
__label__1	"Worked Great - eats tapes after some use: Like many who have found this camcorder, I liked the canon name and bought based on Canon and value. It was a mistake because I don't feel I should have already used up the life of this camera yet. If you go to several discussion groups you will see it has several issues with the deck, i.e. ""transport"". Just google zr20/40 etc. and ""eat tapes"". Suggest you try Sony or Panasonic."
__label__1	Not as pictured: The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. The product description is vague if not poor.The lights received are much smaller than in the photo (an inch in diameter). They are useless as illumination. I live in a high-sun area and have placed the charger in a position where it gets sun from dawn to dusk. The cord from the charger and the lights is long, which allows you to place the charger on the roof. In the end they are not worth the price.
__label__2	Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price: This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world.
__label__2	"This book revolutionized the way I look at myself: I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are ""different."" I never knew so many things I thought were ""wrong"" with me were commonalities to being gifted. Now that I know, I recognize it in my friends and students and I finally have a structured way to improve how I communicate and interact with ""normal"" people. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's smart and feels like they don't fit in."
__label__1	"Anesthesia for the gifted: I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
__label__1	Mediocre: This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book.
__label__1	"I was promised new!!: well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"
__label__2	Good Product: Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)
__label__1	Absolute Garbage: There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down. If it's a lightweight drapery panel, you may be in luck. Otherwise, forget about it.
__label__1	Not exceptional: As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. They really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.I ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.I wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from Country Curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. Of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!
__label__1	shipped wrong color: I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. When the order was received, one of the rods was in pewter. They agreed to send a return shipping label for the incorrect item, but I would have to pay shipping on one rod.
__label__2	Dainty: This item is very beautiful and dainty, but a lot smaller than I thought. The stones could also be better, but the design is so catching that it makes up for it. I should also add that Charoite is a very hard stone to find at a good price, so if you are looking at affordable, this is it. Trust me, I spent several hours searching. Overall I really like this pendant.
__label__2	beautiful: I love this pendant. My only complaint was that the stone needs to be polished but, other than that, it's perfect. The design really stands out and I get compliments on it often. :)
__label__2	Love it!: I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. I wear this necklace often and love it!
__label__2	good book for little ones: We loved this book! Anything that confirms what we are trying to teach is always great to find! This book teaches about gaurding your heart in a funny and cute way, but it shows the reality of what happens when we give in to temptation and watch things that we shouldn't! This book is GREAT!
__label__2	Recommend for young musicians: This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.
__label__1	Not for me.: Thought it was poorly written. The story was long & boring. Thought I would try her to find new writers. will not buy again.
__label__2	"good fantasy romance: This book, though not ""great literature"", is a fun read, with plenty of romance and suspense. But you have to be willing to temporarily (for the duration of reading the book) believe in magic, including magical time travel, to let yourself get into the story. This book does have an engrossing, suspenseful story line in addition to the romance, so it is much better than those romance books that are simply an evolving romance held together by boring daily life events. I recommend it as good entertainment reading."
__label__1	Long and involved: Had a hard time following the story. Typos in dates really had me confused Malcolm was introduced in 1864 not 1964.
__label__2	a great cooooooooooooool album.: don't blive the random guy up there i have heard it it's have great songs and the d.j vir is very cool buy it and u 'll see .
__label__1	Two thumbs down- I've never been more disapppointed: I've never been so disappointed with a CD!! If there were 3 songs on the CD that I liked it was a lot. And there are just some songs that should not be re-made by different artists- two in particular from this album is the Love song from the Titanic movie and Hopelessly Devoted To You. So I wouldn't even bother.
__label__1	The music is old and tired at this point.: The music has been out. What is the purpose of it? Forget it
__label__1	"It isn't a toy...: This is a decorative item that, although it's advertized as ""crystal,"" looks a great deal more like pressed glass. It does, however, come with ""lead content warnings"" so one must assume that it is, indeed, lead crystal. But don't expect sparkle -- the item is neither cut nor polished.It's small and pretty, and comes in a cheap plastic presentation case lined with flocked paper and Disney advertising. Still, what else are you going to give to a woman cast in the role?"
__label__2	beautiful!: Ai Yazawa does it again. Her gorgeous art makes this book great- for paradise kiss fans or anyone else who happens to open it. Yazawa is a creative genious and her fashion designs are beautiful, using the gothic lolita style that has become increasingly popular in the US. I suggest you read this book...if not for the awesome story, then for the even more awesome art.
__label__1	"Just Unnecessary: As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."
__label__1	Buy the box set instead of this!: All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set
__label__1	Poor value for money: I agree with most people that this is an un-necessary release. It is an obvious attempt to cash in by the holders of the rights. But on the other hand it is also a cheaper alternative to the 'With the lights out box'. I own the box and can honestly say it is definitely worth the extra money to buy that. This doesn't even offer the best of the box anyway, which it clear states in the title. I only bought this because I like to own anything and everything with the Nirvana name on it. I believe Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles and any unheard recording of the bands I must have.Only hardcore fans will want to buy this, it only offers 3 previously unreleased recording of which only two are any good. 'Sappy' and a 1985 recorded version of 'Spank Thru' which surely must be the first ever recording by Nirvana.As far as value for money goes, this doesn't have anything to offer, sadly.
__label__1	Best of what box?: There is no excuse for the CD to be made. I thought when it was first announced it would be HIGHLIGHTS from the box set and a couple other songs they didn't put on the box. This CD is overburdened with scraps, there were great (full) songs on With The Lights Out, but only a couple of them show up here. Once again, the Cobain estate is going to try to sap us as much as possible until they give us a complete rareties, compilation and b-side tracks set. Buy the box set and make your own compilation.
__label__1	"Smells like dollar signs...: Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
__label__1	"A dreadful waste of cash: If this is the ""best of the box"" then thank God I didn't buy the box. Most of this stuff should never have left Cobain's closet."
__label__1	Nirvana Sliver Best Of The Box: As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect.
__label__1	"Horrible CD: I bought this CD thinking it was a ""Best Of"" or ""greatest Hits"" type thing. It is far from that to be sure. Sure there are alot of songs here but they are all old demo's or just poorly recorded live stuff from garage practices & small clubs. Maybe I'm just too jaded, but the sound quality was horrible. I mean I was disapointed in it not being studio recordings in the 1st place. But in this day & age you should be able to go in & clean the really poor sound quality up a bit before packaging it up & selling it to the general public. It basicly sounds like it was recorded usuing a portable cassette tape player, & a cheap one at that! I'm gonna see if I can get some fool to actually give me some money for this piece of trash on Ebay, but I doubt it."
__label__1	Why keep on going with this crap?: It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana was never good, it was music for depressive people. Skip on this one that it is being release to fill the pockets of her stupid daughter and his stupid ex wife. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the most worst band of all times.
__label__1	Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't: Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was.
__label__1	Awful: Wish I had read the reviews first. I had no idea how bad the sound quality was before I bought this.
__label__1	"Milk It: Some Of The Box: Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
__label__1	Low Quality POS: I would have given it zero stars if possible. This is the worst cd I have ever listened to. The quality of the recordings are so bad that it hurts your ears to listen to it. This has the sound of the worst bootleg recordings I have ever heard. What a waste of money. This is the only cd that I have bought that I was actually unable to listen to. Talk about a sham by some corporate execs trying to make some money off of a dead guy.
__label__1	Completely Useless: I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD.
__label__1	Horrible Quality: Even though the song list looks impressive, don't waste your money on this one. This is the poorest quality sound I've ever heard on a CD.Being a Nirvana Fan, I have other albums that sound great, but I can't recommend this one.Again don't waste your money.
__label__1	This doesnt deserve one star: What is happening here. First, a sub-par greatest hits album and then this sad best of the box. I love Nirvana but Courtney Love is really tampering with Kurt Cobains catalogue. The greatest hits should of had breed, polly, and verse chorus verse. Back to the box set now.This best of the box isn't even the best of!
__label__1	I made better recordings in my garage: I was expecting a lot more when I bought this CD. I was expecting studio quality demos similar to Metallica's Garage Days. This CD is litterally a compilation of poorly mixed cassette tape recordings. Quality is very bad.
__label__2	"who are you?: This CD is great for some people, but I think a lot of other people are buying it who maybe shouldn't.For the Nirvana fanatic with money, get the full boxed set, you will probably find the DVD and the book to be worth the extra money, even if you don't listen to the added tracks.If you aren't a fanatic, stick with the albums. You will not like the low sound quality of the recordings.Now, for the Nirvana fanatic who's a bit short on cash, but absolutely has to have ""Do Re Mi"" as part of his collection, that's who this is for. ""Do Re Mi"" is an excellent track, one of Nirvana's best...so if you are a serious Nirvana fan, you DO need to have that one."
__label__1	Totally F***ing Pointless!!!: F*** You, Geffen, F*** You Courtney Love!!!! Dave Grohl why didn't you STOP THEM, YOU WERE MY HERO... WHAT HAPPENED DAVE????? My God, it has come to this...
__label__1	Uhh yea right: I downloaded it for free courtny, then i kept the new songs then deleted the rest..thank for this waster of plastic tho..
__label__1	"Good job Courtney...: Releasing a Box set, then a year later releasing a CD containing mostly Box Set songs and then three new ones, hoping the hardcore fans will buy both to get the full list of songs. It's a shame.She said she is bringing Francis Bean into the ""family business""- the family business of milking all the money you can of your husband's music? That's low Courtney, even for you."
__label__1	Tasteless Trash: If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!
__label__1	Listen to the samples before you buy: Okay, I made a HUGE mistake. I was at Best Buy (no on-line reviews...) and bought this CD based on the song list. Listen to the samples before you buy, you'll be convinced that YOU TOO, can be a ROCK STAR. I wouldn't buy an album that had me singing on it, but Kurt sounds weirdly like my own crooning in the first track. OOO, OWWW, MAKE HIM STOP....
__label__1	"Unnessecary Garbage: Recently, Nirvana released the amazing ""With The Lights Out"" box set. Truly, a definitive Nirvana collection.Now they have released this compilation, Silver: The Best Of The Box. All the songs on the record can be found on With The Lights Out ANYWAY, and they didn't even pick the most notable songs from the set anyhow.If you should buy this, you should only be a DIE HARD Nirvana fan, who only buys this on principal."
__label__1	Very Low Quality Recordings: Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere.
__label__1	"2pac of rock is back!: I own the boxset of Nirvana and its good. It took awhile to come out, but it was worth it. Now this? A cd that takes the best moments from the box and adds three new tracks? How much more will fans have to suffer? Whats next for fans? Kurt's legacy is like 2Pac and being crapped on but his greedy friends and family. I cant wait for Scott Stapp to produce the next Nirvana ""lost cd""!"
__label__1	"HORRIBLE: ok--first of all, saying that this CD is the ""best"" of anything is completely wrong, and don't give me that Bullsh*t about ""you try to write something"" thats not the issue. the issue is the fact that this CD contains Horrible quality tracks that someone who put 200$ into some mics could top. Nirana rocks, but this cd blows.Thx courtney, now go do some blow."
__label__2	"Screw you Doug the ""guitar player"": Bloody hell man, are damn stupid, Nirvana were an amazing band. Just because Kurt played simple stuff on the guitar, hey man, I'd really like to see you come up with something as good as that, it ain't in the technicality piss head, it's in the bloody soul, Kurt had soul (an unhappy one, but a soul). You are a bloody souless creature who deserves nothing less than to go to hell. I play guitar and I respect Kurt Cobain for doing what he did. His music had so much feeling and emotion, I don't know what kind of music you like, why don't you bloody well tell me! I like beer, and Nirvana goes very well with beer, try it, you serpentine monster! I am Bonzo, and I love Nora more than anything in this world!"
__label__1	"$ Scam: The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."
__label__1	Don't Buy: This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. DON'BUY IT!!
__label__1	"Thought I was missing more than this...: I don't own the box set but, if this is the best of the box then I'm not missing much. I really like Nirvana but there really just aren't many winners here especially since this is suppose to be the pick of the litter from ""With the lights out"".There are a few solid tracks here but I just expected more..."
__label__1	"Very easy to solve!: This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
__label__2	Great gift to pass on!: Gave this to a friend in October.... they finally solved it in Dec when her relatives came to visit.... the Univ of Virginia student solved it! She will pass it on to our other friends for their birthdays...Really like the game, its made well and it is harder than you think. I actually had to get my William and Mary graduate to put it together! I also gave one to my Mom for Christmas, who has not solved it yet. She will pass it on to her ladies she plays cards with. Its fun and different....a good conversation piece!
__label__2	"Synopsis: Dr. Ivie is in Italy looking for a beetle. Unfortunately, the beetle he seeks was only found one time by one person thirty years ago in one hole in the ground, and it's only about a millimeter long. While the graduate students dig and all sift through mud, dream sequences, animation, and stock footage open a window into the obsession and passion that drives these impossible tasks of science. The ""science"" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process."
__label__1	"Really bad....: This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."
__label__1	Stupid: I must admit, it was terrible. I hate to admit i liked it. I guess it was so STUPID, you couldn't help it.
__label__1	"Stinks like stale cabbage!: This movie is bad, Bad, BAD! Makes Rudy Ray Moore look like Fellini!Essentially, this is the crude ""story"" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Problem is: outrageously bad acting, corny ""humor,"" strong and unecessary reverse racism (the lone geeky White character is constantly referred to as a ""cracker,"") vile sexism, unappealing characters. etc. etc.Get this video only if your fireplace runs low this winter."

__label__2	great book - both down to earth and inspiring: Good for beginners or for those already on a spiritual path - as always another perspective gives you insights in areas you may have thought you had it all sussed or confirms something you had not quite got your head around yet. Forgiving and generous - a book to come back to.
__label__2	"Boot Camp to Spiritual Fitness: This book is definitely an ""In Your Face"" program. Each chapter presents full frontal examination of your Spirituality.Unless you do the exercises at the end of each chapter, you are missing the full benefit of the book.I highly recommend you use this book in a class or at least working with one other person to discuss what comes up for you."

__label__2	"Awesome guide for the experienced mountaineer: This book outlines hundreds of different routes up all of the Wind's well-known peaks (as well as several not-so-well-know ones). He did a phenomenal job amassing all of this information. There is enough here for a short lifetime of awesome mountain trekking.The information Kelsey gives is mean, lean, and straight to the point. Novices beware, this book makes no attempts to come down to anyone's level. It is written for those grounded in that arts of route-finding, technical climbing, and alpine survival. It is not a hiking book. If you are uncomfortable with this, either buy a more toned-down Wind River guide, or pick up a book to build your skills like ""Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills"" and start psyching yourself up for some world class backcountry."
__label__1	Too broad and too liitle info: Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more.
__label__1	E.A.'s reveiw: I bought this book for my book club and I have had a very hard time reading it. The characters are too life-like in my opinion for me to have any sympathy towards them. I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read. If only the rest of the books followed such a formula.
__label__2	Long but interesting: I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book.
__label__1	good story, overdetailed writing: Having first viewed the TV version of this story, I find that the written version tends to be overlong and overdetailed. (I am not that interested in the brand of cigars that old Jolyon smokes.) I am only about 1 1/2 chapters into the book and hope it gets livlier soon.
__label__2	The Best Book I have read in years: I was bored one night and picked up this book that had been on the shelf for probably 20 years. Oh my goodness -- if you love Jane Austen and England, you will love this book. I could not put it down. The characters -- although numerous and many with the same Christian names! -- are kept distinct and are extremely vividly drawn. One realizes how the social sanctions of the day kept people in their place -- just the discussion of what divorce did to a family alone is worth its weight in understanding how social mores have changed. I thought I would be bored stiff and came away 4 days later after finishing this book wanting to start the next one, 700 pages and all. Enjoy!
__label__2	"Rancid Crank Out Another Classic...: Rancid's new CD is nothing like Life Won't, but that whole ska thing was getting old anyway. This album on the other hand is dripping with mad punk rock aggression that doesn't even give the listener a chance to breath inbetweeen songs. Almost every track on here is good, but gritty songs like ""Poison"" and ""Its Quite Alright"" stand out the most. Rancid 2000 is a true punk rock classic."
__label__1	Marginal: This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.
__label__2	hard topic but well worth the knowledge: Ms Too has tackled a subject that is immensely difficult to learn. However, I thought her approach and explaination was excellent. Readers, please be patient and reread each section more than once.Again, advance Feng Shui puts alot of people in despair due to the topic but once you master the knowledge, the wisdom and flow will pour forth clearly.
__label__1	How Annoying! Total waste of money: I bought this book planning on checking the Feng Shui for my house for the year 2002 and find out after reading several chapters that Lillian Too assumes your house was built since 1984 or has had major renovation during this period. If this is not the case then the rest of the book (i.e. the most important part) is totally useless. Buy another book, any book except this one.

__label__1	Not HAPPY: I purchased this for my sony camcorder. I have windows XP on my laptop and this cable does not work. My laptop does not even detect my camcorder when attached.............Its a waste according to me
__label__1	Sony I. Link 4Pin Digital Video Cable: I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors. I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality. It was advertised as new. When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work. On examining it I found that it had a bent pin. When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder. What a bummer. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection. I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons.

__label__2	Blows Toxic Avenger I away: For those of you who liked TA 1, you've got to get this one. If you thought the first one was funny, then this one is gonna have you rolling on the floor. Imagine the King of Porn, Ron Jeremy, playing a priest--well, he does in this one. That irony is funny enough, but there are are TONS of other funny sh*t in this flick. This movie is non-stop from the get-go. If you like all the Troma goodies--gore, outrageousness, gratuitous nudity, a little bit of lesbo action, and over-the-top comedy--then this movie is a MUST for your collection. You don't just have to be a Troma fan to like this movie. Like I said, if you like all of the things listed above, then you should get this flick. Trust me, you won't be sorry. Just don't watch it with your grandmother or little ones.
__label__2	Movies I Own U Should 2!!!!!!!!!!!: Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!

__label__1	BEYOND OFFENSIVE!: If you love, care, like, or even have the smallest amount of respect for yourself or another person don't expose them to this garbage! I did not expect a movie with taste, and I enjoy B-movies, tacky gross outs, and off color humor. BUT THIS MOVIE GOES WAY OVERBOARD! The filmakers trying so hard to be shocking they forget to give this flick anything that a decent human being could find enjoyable.
__label__1	One of the lesser Louis L'Amour novels: I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan. This one held so much promise for me, describing the culture and life of the Californios. And then he had to inject that mystic story of another world in there.....
__label__2	"California History/Mystery All In One!: This one doesn't really fall into the Western category, but it's full of hammering action, informative local California history, and mystic goings-on. Seacoast adventures, early Califronia ranching, great good-guys and really bad bad-guys, and mysterious appearances by silent, unknown characters fill this one to the brim! Best of all, L'Amour introduces in this story, for what I believe was the first time in his writings, the famous ""portal to the other side,"" which really sets this story apart from almost all of his other works. Excellent yarn through and through. You won't forget it for a long time after you first read it!"
__label__2	"Good choice for light duty homeowners: I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7"" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven't tried the 1.3"" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don't see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year."
__label__1	"Poor support from Plasplugs: About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
__label__1	Don't waste your time or money on this: First the good things. It cuts through ceramic tile easily and I actually had good success using the 45 degree cutting feature, although, it's a little sloppy.Now for the bad. I had problems similar to previous readers:The fence had to be modified to fit, it is very difficult to adjust, it is not accurate (you will need to use a tape measure), and the fence stripped out after about 10 cuts so it could no longer clamp to the table.This made it effectively USELESS for accurate cutting, so my day of tiling was wasted. Oh, and tiles catch on rear blade gaurd.I am now going to try and return the saw.
__label__1	"Not very good: I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
__label__1	Spend your money elsewhere...: You could do a lot better for the price of this tool. Comparing it to comprable models costing half as much? I recommend spending for the cheaper models or springing for something better. The blade wouldn't align with the blade guard until I modified the table with a file. The tightening bolt that runs through the fence stripped in less than two weeks of light use. (Trust me, I'm not THAT strong.) Spend less or spend more, just don't bother to spend for this tool. One additional note: I contacted the manufacturer about the stripped rip fence and they promptly sent me a replacement without questions. I suppose that's worth an upgrade to 2 1/2 stars. I still think one could do better for the money. Oh, and my saw leaks water continuously when the unit is operating. Better leave it at two stars afterall.
__label__1	Plasplug is JUNK!!: By something else. This is the worst piece of machinery I have ever bought. Virtually impossible to cut any size tile on the diagonal. Typical imported junk!!!!!
__label__1	Not recommended: I have to agree with most of the reviews here. This saw is a peice of junk. I returned it almost immediatey. What a waste of time! I should have read the reviews here first!
__label__1	Very poor: This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it.
__label__1	Buy Something Else!: The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good.
__label__1	PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter: Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name.
__label__1	spend the additional money and get an MK: My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw....
__label__1	Bad fence, Bad tilt: The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!
__label__1	Made Me Feel Worse!: A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS. After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS, I began to feel horrible: very irritable, nauseous and foggy. After doing some research, I found that a percentage of women react very negatively to this herb -- some people remarked that they initially felt better, but then progressively felt worse and thought they were going crazy; some said they immediately felt terrible. I guess it's a gamble that many of us are willing to take to feel better though. Wish it had worked!
__label__1	Not one change: I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since.
__label__1	made my head spin: this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use. I ended up tossing it out.
__label__1	Didn't help: I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came. I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help, but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first.
__label__2	Vitex: This product was great , smells weird but it is a root. I would buy it again, no side effects. Great service and price.
__label__2	It's Working...: My husband and I have been TTC for 2 yrs with no luck (yet) so after much research I decided to order Vitex. My cycles were anywhere between 35-40 days and I had little to no CM. I took it as directed last month and noticed 100% improvement in my CM and I ovulated on day 15 which is unheard of for me! So far, this cycle seems to be identical to last month which is awesome! I haven't gotten a BFP yet but it has helped regulate my cycle!
__label__1	Caused tiredness and confusion: I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!
__label__2	Worked like a CHARM!: I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!
__label__2	Excellent use of Humor to teach Finance: Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports. The use of the Spouse House Firm throughout the book allows you to see the develop of financial reports as they apply to a small growing firm. Robert writes as he is right in front of you talking to someone he has known for a long time. He uses humor to help you understand the difficult concepts of the book. If you are looking to learn financial statements or just refresh your skills this is the book I recommend.
__label__1	zero stars - an absolute horror: This is the 2nd CD that I've purchased of rerecorded versions of Monty's 60s songs. This record label is crooked for putting a 60s photo of Monty on a CD that was clearly recorded in the 80s or 90s. Abysmal. Shameful. Vile. Criminal. An Abomination.
__label__1	Dissapointing: I purchased this product to help eliminate my mild acne, and used it in conjunction with MDSkincare's cleanser/toner, and tinted moisturizer. I have 4 days left of my 30 day supply and have seen no improvement in my acne, or noticable improvement in overall skintone. Actually, I am now breaking out in places I've never had probelms with before. I will try Perricone products next, the MDScincare pads seemed to be a waste of $75 for me.
__label__2	Fantastic: Love this product, makes my skin look and feel great! It's easy to use, no mess no fuss. I don't use it everyday because I like to save it for the weekends because it makes my skin feel so good.
__label__2	Best Product I have EVER purchased: It takes alot for me to feel the urge to write a review on anything. I have very sensitive skin (so many things irritate it) and I also have dry skin. Recently I was having skin problems with my forehead (tiny little bumps under the skin). Nothing helped - even a prescription from the derm. When I used this peel literally within an hour I noticed a difference in my skin (not kidding). The little bumps seemed to lessen and my dry skin became smooth. I was afraid to use this product every day (bc of my sensitive skin) but so far I have had no problems at all. My skin looks so much better. No longer dry, tiny bumps pretty much gone, and tone looks better.I use it at night though instead of the morning. Kind of makes the skin a tad sticky.
__label__1	Totally trashed my skin!: I bought this at Ulta after doing some research regarding chemical peels helping acne, and one of the sales associates recommended this product. My acne has always been pretty mild, but I wanted to see if I could get it under control better. My skin is extremely delicate. My skin actually felt great for the first few days of using this product -- balanced out my skin tone very nicely. Perhaps I should've stopped there, as after a week I broke out with HORRIBLE deep, cystic, painful acne that took me weeks to get over. The scars/pock marks they left behind were even worse. I would be wary if you have sensitive skin. Fortunately, the folks at Ulta remembered me from a few weeks prior and refunded my money. Sadly, I did almost no explaining as my face told the whole story.
__label__1	Not for everyone's skin!: I bought this in hopes to reduce some small bumps on my cheeks and even out my skin tone. What I got was horrible acne and sores all over my face. The very next morning after using it I woke up with zits on my face! I haven't had acne since I was a teenager. My first thought was, it must be cleaning out the pores, thus the breakout, but after three weeks of using it every other day, my face is covered in sores that won't heal! I don't want to say it's a bad product, because it obviously works for most of the people that have written reviews, but my experience has not been good. I will never use it again. I'm just glad I got it on sale for $45. C'est la vie.
__label__2	Less one star due to price: I was surprised that after a few days use one really can tell a change in pore size without the harshness of an astringent. This is a real quick & easy effective non-irritating skin program to follow. I wish it came in much larger sizes to bring the price point down. The cost is the only factor that may keep me from future purchasing w/o a coupon or gold box discount. Actually I would like to try the entire line-so I really hope it will be featured frequently in the gold box or Friday sale.
__label__2	A Facial in a Pad: There is enough product on the mini pads to go over your entire face and neck. The fragrence of step 1 smells good.Overall this product does work. It definately clears up your face. I didn't use this product everyday since I wasn't sure if this was a product that contained 100% natural ingredients.
__label__1	Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars....: This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare.
__label__2	SO Expensive BUT...: Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.
__label__2	Beautiful product!: I've reviewed a couple of other Waechtersbach items, and I'm quite happy with these as well! I have only two minor complaints. First, on these, the glaze seems to be scratching (utensils?) more than the other Waechtersbach products I have...my plates and cereal bowls aren't doing that. Second, all four of them had a funny little bump on the outside rim...it looked identical on all four. Maybe a slight manufacturing defect? The glaze is slightly darker around the bump, so you can see it, though it's not overly obvious. But overall I love them - they're great for soups and pasta (spaghetti especially). They're holding up quite well in the dishwasher, too - no chips or cracks, despite how they sort of lean against one another. Very pleased!
__label__2	Memoir or Memory?: Although Derrida can be difficult to follow sometimes, this work is extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Well illustrated as well, as should be expected considering it was the catalogue for an exhibition.
__label__2	Jiggy Fly...worth it: All throughout the basic wraith book they make references to this. They did so with good reason. The info on Soulforging was great, thogh i thought that the focus should have stayed on the more modern powers. The history of the coup is nice, and i thought it was worth the cost
__label__2	Fascinating view into the past: This book is fascinating for anyone at all interested in New Zealand history or a general account of life in the past. It is surprisingly well written for what is just a series of letters, and gives a real insight into life as a pioneer in the 1860s, with all its highs and lows. You'll laugh at the author's first attempts at baking, and cry with her as she digs dead lambs from a snowdrift. It's a wonderful book and I heartily recommend it.
__label__2	A very amusing look at the past: I was hoping for far more details about working and handling sheep in the ways the New Zealander's did in the past when I got this book. Unfortunately, this is a collection of letters from a 'high society' girl that was packed up and moved to the NZ outback with her fiancee. Granted, it's amusing and reasonably interesting to read how she sees the world, as well as a bit insightful into how at least one family thought of their slaves and house maids during a time fortunately long behind us.
__label__1	"Didn't like...: I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
__label__1	Two Divas,that should shut up!: Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!
__label__1	Movie Version is Much better!: The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light.
__label__2	THE SONG IS SOULFUL: U ARE ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS AND IN THIS SONG THE TWO OF U SOUND ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. WHEN ARE U COMING TO INDIA
__label__2	"Wuzzup, Mariah!?! I'm Kaligirl from Seoul!: ""When You Believe"" is an awesome song. To me Mariah's songs hit me like nukes! The awesome duet performed with Whitney Houston I'll never get sick of. This song(to me) is combined with spiritual, and also relates to the racism. I personally recommend this song to both Kids and Adults!"
__label__1	New Age?: The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves.
__label__2	When you believe: This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!
__label__2	I really like this music because of the words and the story: The singers are very good, both of them has a very nice voice and they are talented singer. I enjoy listening this music very much
__label__2	Informative: Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all.
__label__2	Honest old fashioned opinion: I have not placed eyes on the original, but it seems all pictures are correctly placed. His honest old fashioned opinion comes to life when he explains he does not appreciate the safe way to carry his axe. I enjoy the tone and ease of reading, you definitely catch on to the vernacular of the time. A great piece of history that impart practices that still having meaning to this day.
__label__2	Beginner woodsman manual: This is basically a beginners guide to traveling, camping, and surviving in the woods. Covers a wide variety of topics from cabin building to snowshoeing. My biggest takeaways from the book are to always have an axe and blanket when traveling in the woods. Also, never explore unfamiliar areas without a compass and a means of fire creation.Don't expect a story. This is a manual.
__label__2	Worth it: I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem
__label__1	"Impressive character development but mostly morbid.: ""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."
__label__1	Wrong title, right author: I selected the complete short stories of Malamud and this book is only a selction of short stories. I was disappointed but we decided to keep it and be more careful in ordering.
__label__1	BORING!: I would suggest before sitting down to read this book that you brew a large pot of coffee. Or better yet, don't sit down to read it at all. This is dry stuff!
__label__2	An almost-perfect book.: Prof. Jay is a genius. All of the techniques shown in this book works effectively. I use many of them during informal nhb matches and they saved my butt hundreds of times. If only Prof. Jay included some ground-fighting escapes and reversals, then I'll recommend this book to everyone, even to BJJ practitioners.
__label__2	Very well authored: I found this book to be very well authored. It shows what you need to know and gives a very detailed method of teaching you the same technique. Though I think the overuse of wrist locks to be inneffective the overall method is great and proven in competition by wally jay and his students (see the history provided in the book)
__label__2	Good book!!!!!!!!: Great book, techniqes you can use! I love this book, the moves cause pain, but no injury. I really like section on finger locks. I did not have a problem with this book, the pictures were great. If you are in the martial arts, or looking in to them, GET THE BOOK.
__label__2	small circle jujitsu book review: Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique.
__label__2	Solid technique: The book has great instruction and drills. It is good for those who have a solid foundation with joint locks and submissions and an overall solid grasp of the body and movement. It has given some good variations of techniques I already teach and use.
__label__1	Alot of decent pictures and instructions: As a student of jiujitsu i understood alot of the moves but i found that without previous knowledge these pictures and instructions were difficult to understand. I feel there is alot of good information but not worth buying.
__label__1	Buy a different jujitsu book: I bought it before I knew anything. Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free.
__label__1	What a strange martial art: I would like to say that I admire any one who puts in the time and effort to learn a martial art and master it. That takes a lot of dedication and hard work. So I really have a great deal of respect for Wally Jay. Having said that though, I think small circle Jujitsu is really an ineffective grappling system. And I also think that it is no good in the street. Reading this book confirmed all of my worst suspicions about this art. Buy it only if you are looking for a good laugh and have money to burn. If not, and you actually want a good book about fighting try anything in Kid Peligro's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu series. Or go buy some Mario Sperry Vale Tudo tapes. Just don't get this book!
__label__2	A great product!: I have been using this cleansing gel for years. I have occasionally tried other products, but keep coming back to Exuviance. My skin is somewhat sensitive and this cleanser leaves it very soft and smooth, with no irritation. Recently, I met a new esthetician who thought I was wearing makeup when I had just washed my face with Exuviance Purifying Cleansing Gel and used moisturizer! She made my day!
__label__1	Total rip off!: I ordered this and realized I didn't specify the size so went back 20 min. later to cancel the order and then order another one.the shipping is 3/4 the priced of the item! Then after what I thought was a canceled order didn't even work at all. I have been sending emails all day and tried to call them to no avail. Horrible communication. they took my money and haven't even responded to my email or phone call.Caveat Emptor
__label__1	A few good tracks: There is only 2-3 great trackes on this. Such a shame that most of these compilations only ever have a few great inspiring tracks while the rest are just pure background stuff.

__label__2	Just essential: This is probably the best reference about Heinlein's works that's ever been written. One of the best thing about it is that it's complete and very well organized, so that you can find whatever you're looking for in a few seconds, very handy.Since I've bought it I've consulted it hundreds of times, I couldn't do without it.
__label__2	"A must-have for the Heinlein collector: Gifford is one of the top experts on Heinlein's works, and his ""A Reader's Companion"" is an exhaustively researched and well-thought-out compendium of nearly all of Heinlein's work.I say ""nearly"" only because the book misses a few Heinlein collections and such that have been published in the few years since Gifford's 2000 printing. [...]I've been collecting Heinlein works for years, even very obscure ones, and I still learned of new things from Gifford's book."
__label__2	I have heard thier music in the movie Southlander: This is really neat music, that makes you feel good inside. Some of the music on this album is part of the sountrack for the movie Southlander. I plan on buying this CD.
__label__2	Good CD: I heard Milk Rock and Spin Spider Spin on internet radio but I fell in love with Tiger. If she were to make a greatest hits CD I would vote for Tiger to be on it. It has a great flow to it like all of her music. On this CD I also liked Gently Waves and Soft Grafitti which are both quietly beautiful. I don't think the length of the song should dictate how much you like it, and that's certainly true of Gently Waves.
__label__2	"Two Families Shaped by History: I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the ""telenovela"" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots."
__label__1	disappointing: This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think.
__label__1	Unbelievable!: I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!
__label__2	the improbable nature of man: Stories from central americal often seem surreal. How could it be that people so rich can live in such close proximity to those so poor? How could people motivated by such high principals commit such barbaric acts of violence? Insulated and liberal in America we so much want to empatize with the poor when in fact we have so much in common with the rich. I found this book so very compelling in that it provided much empathy for all sides of this conflict. One could not demonize any party. Instead I watched helplessly as the events unfolded and greived each needless loss. I recommend this book for your soul as your heart needs the exercise.

__label__2	Good family fare: Although it's not the most current movie, it still has a lot of warmth and good acting in it. I especially love the depiction of family.
__label__1	"Cheezy and unbearable. Only watched 20 mins: Had family over and we thought it might be a ""cute"" movie. But it turned out to be unbearably bad. Cheezy with bad acting. Couldn't watch after 20 mins."
__label__1	Abandoned this one: This is about the trials and tribulations of a multigenerational family.We found it disengaging and rather tedious. It went on and on without getting far at the beginning and we started skipping scenes to see if it picked up. In the end we abandoned it.I'd hoped for more from a movie with Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan & Karisma Kapoor but this was 1999 and I guess it wasn't among their better stuff. The music and dance was ho-hum and unmemorable too.Elsewhere on the Net it scores average. However it was below average for us and not a keeper.
__label__2	Charger works great: The charger works fine as advertised. The location of the of the charger inlet on the phone itself is not very good - makes it awkward if you are charging and trying to talk.
__label__1	Scratched the lens with a kleenex: I used these once then used a Kleenex to wipe one lens that was a little smudged. I have microscopic vision and I noticed it was scratched AFTER I used the Kleenex, so to be sure, I used it again and sure enough, it scratched the lens some more. I compared the 2 lenses and the other lens looked pristine, whereas the one I used the kleenex on was scratched all over! Very low quality lenses! Unusable after one use!
__label__1	Weak out-dated plans: I got this book expecting a bunch of puzzles from the cover and title. There are many other items to be found, but everything looks very out-dated. Definitely keep looking if you want puzzles or other up-to-date patterns.Wayne
__label__1	"Great translation, Poor packaging: I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!"
__label__2	Excellent read - better than most environmentalist novels: I am usually turned off by environmentalist preachy novels, but I thoroughly enjoyed Midworld. The world itself was well-conceived as a dangerous out-of-control environment, and at the same time in-balance with its own rules.
__label__2	Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream: I think people read Alan Dean Foster because they know what they will get. The writing is clear and clean, the story imaginative, and nothing is very challenging. Something to read just for pleasure if you don't want to be doing something else.
__label__1	"True stem-winder of a novel: Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."
__label__1	not for children: My eight year old son came home with this and after reading a little I took it away from him. This is the kind of stuff that warps minds and is only appropriate for those already warped. There are plenty of those.Make sure your kids don't read this untill they are older. Its all about killing and screaming in a tour of hell.
__label__2	Fantastic classic: I've read nearly everything Foster has written and this book is my absolute favorite (Into the Out of is a close second) The flora and fauna of this world is what grabbed my imagination and the different levels of the rain forest is very well thought out. I'd love to see Jim Hensons production company make this into a movie
__label__2	A great classic: I remember reading this when I was young. I found it again on Amazon and bought it to share with my kids. A sci-fi classic! I would recommend this to all kids, young and young-at-heart.
__label__1	dont know!: the program looks fun but the software i recieved was corupt it wont load on any machine.
__label__1	It was ghostwritten, duh!: Hello people. First of all, Naomi Campbell did not write this book. It was written for her. She has admitted this in interviews. Why would anyone want to read a novel written by a supermodel anyway. I guess people who read books authored by Fabio would dig it
__label__2	A Peek into Modeling: This is a very fascinating book that lets you see inside the minds of five unique characters (plus Swan herself). It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring! The characters are written with excellent detail and realism and the story has lots of twists and turns. Impossible to put down!
__label__2	Simply riveting; 1960s and Today: It holds its power: My sense is that Baldwin wrote The Fire Next Time for anyone who had ears to hear, regardless of color or faith or gender. The emotional intelligence with which he speaks is riveting.
__label__2	Life-changing: My number one all time favorite book. Clarified many things about racism and religion in America, by the most eloquent voice I've ever had the pleasure of reading.
__label__2	Cyndi surpasses her debut!: It's rare for a sophomore release to surpass an artist's debut; but this is one album that seems to have done just that. I loved Cyndi's debut, but this album exceeded my expectations, which we all know is rare with most sophomore releases. Although she's Australian, Cyndi has a deep, rich, bluesy voice, that sounds like she grew up in the backwoods of the deep South. This is the quintessential of stripped down, bluesy, country roots music.
__label__2	Wait, wait - it gets better!: There are people who will start reading this book then about 100 pages into it realize that it's going nowhere fast. Take my advice and keep reading. It gets much better, and more interesting. The ending is really good, and might have even upped this review a star.ac
__label__2	Beauty is an Enemy to the less fortunate: Because of her fresh beauty- think Uma Thurman-she is pursued. Because of her sex- female gender- she is helpless. Because of her helplessness-being in female form- she is taken. She then is captured & violated. Because she is violated she is ruined. Yet, still a pure woman
__label__2	Hardy's Dead, but he's still alive in Writing: A compeling and creepy classical fiction to read. It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why. But the bottom line's that, from the first chapter until the last, you'll feel as if there's someone standing behind you, ready to hurt you. Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person.
__label__1	The worst book in the history of literature.: The time spent on reading this book could have been spent on someting worth while and interesting such as watching the grass grow, or picking my teeth. It was a real disappointment and the reading of this book by anyone with a life should by outlawed.
__label__2	Tess of the D'Urbevilles: This book was a true tragedy between two social classes and a girl who tried helping her family and herself at the same time, and yet she suffered for it in the end.
__label__2	A LOOK BACK INTO TIME & ROMANACE: WONDERFUL DISCRIPTIVE NOVEL. HEARTWARMING & HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. HARD TO PUT IN DOWN. WOULD READ IT AGAIN. CREATIVE WRITING BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR.
__label__2	"Witty, charming and deliciously hillarious!: After reading Tess of the Durbervilles I could not help but feel a little disapointed when I finished it. I couldn't tear myself away from it. I absolutely adored Tess's manners and her ""cousins"" annnoying manner of Tess's sweet temper. I always wondered wether if Tess and he would get together throughout the entire novel.Boy was I surprised!"
__label__1	Sorely disappointed: The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!
__label__1	Zzzzzzzzzz.....: TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck.
__label__1	Exhausting: This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students.
__label__1	Bit of a Letdown in the End: This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville.
__label__1	Most pathetic character in all of literature.: Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!
__label__2	great book: This is a classic book that I have always loved and now can read on my Kindle. Glad to see it free!
__label__2	finally! A book that's different.: I don't understand why everyone else who wrote a review didn't like this book. It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good.
__label__2	A True Epic: My favorite book of classic literature, Tess had me crying and begging for more. Hardy unfolds this tale with true genius. Filled with love, hate, depression, and happiness, Hardy does an incredible job of displaying human emotion. I heartily recommend it without second thoughts
__label__1	Not a brilliant book but...: I didn't like this book very much. It was silly. I'm sorry that I've wasted time reading this book. There are better books to read.
__label__1	An unfortunately boring book: I'm a fan of classics, but I could not force myself to struggle through this book. I could neither identify with the characters (Tess especially seemed extraordinarily weak-willed and passive) nor follow through the endless description of the novel. Iw ould suggest a different book
__label__1	Very Low Quality Binding/Paper: This edition is basically newsprint with a hard binding. What a racket! Signet Classics (Pocket size) with introduction by Marcelle Clements.Tess of the D'urbervillesAnd the binding is not good, either--don't know what the word for it is but no left margin.
__label__1	Glad to be of this century: I didn't like the book. The language was difficult to read and in the end the topic was one i don't agree with. The ultra right values where women were always at fault for tempting a man and she was the one dealt final cruel punishment. I am relieved to be of this century. Makes us appreciate what we have and what those before us had to suffer for us to be where we are now.
__label__2	Incredible Literary Work: Tess of the d'Urbervilles is an outstanding piece of literature. It follows the struggles of its protagonist through life in the 1900s. Anyone who is interested in literature to the slightest degree must read this novel. It is captivating, spellbinding, and heartwrenching. Rarely do I cry while reading a novel, but I was weeping throughout this book. The incredible journey Tess goes on is unmatched by any other piece of literature to date.
__label__2	how tess' motherhood experience change her life...: Tess, a naive and young girl whose one night relationship with her cousin Alec ruins her life, is a great example of a woman in love who would do anything for her husband and nothing for herself. Tess is a great book to read. I NEED HELP AND SOON IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAVE A TERM PAPER ON TESS DUE (THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOTHERHOOD BEFORE BEING WED IN ENGLAND IN THE 1800'S AS SEEN IN TESS) PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY MATERIAL THAT CAN HELP ME EMAIL IT TO ME. tHANKS IN ADVANCED!!!!!
__label__1	This book has a dire need to be shortened: This book in the beginning was so slow that I finished a book twice it's length before I finished the first chapter of Tess of the D'Urdubervilles.
__label__1	Defective edition: I've enjoyed reading this edition for its critical essays and helpful footnotes, but the copy I ordered from Amazon was missing thirty pages. (It turns out that pages 14 through 44 are printed twice, resuming at page 77). They may have corrected the problem in other copies, but don't assume that you'll get the whole book!
__label__1	Disappointing: I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
__label__2	A Classic Theme In Life: I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time.
__label__2	Mum's the word, says Victorian novelist.: A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars.
__label__2	Typical Manipulations with Tragic Consequences: Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished.
__label__2	Tess of the D'Urbervilles: Once again an excellant service from Amazon. The book is just as I expected. A good quality paper back.R.V.Angel.
__label__2	Classic Thomas Hardy: Perhaps the greatest of the works by Thomas Hardy. It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb.
__label__2	Such a tragically great love story: Absolutely loved the story it's definitely worth reading through. I found some things a little difficult to follow because it's old English, but it was still a great read.
__label__2	Tess of the D' U rbervilles: I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life.
__label__2	Best book forced to read......: Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years.
__label__1	The worst book i have ever read in my Life: This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away.
__label__1	Do not read this book!: I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped.
__label__1	Buyer Beware: This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.
__label__1	The worst book I have read: I don't know how can this book be a classic. I haven't thought that I could find such absurd stuff in a book. Don't waste your time with it.
__label__1	Boring: I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person.
__label__1	Boring!: We had to read it for our GCSE coursework. Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!
__label__1	WHY???????????????????????????????????????????????????: WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	couldn't give it more stars: I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ....
__label__2	Just fine, good example of why more literature should be allowed to enter the public domain ...: The book stands on its own, though I found the ending disappointing. I downloaded this in order to be able to follow the more obscure passages of an audiobook version and it was excellent for that purpose; the digital edition worked just fine on my iPad with no difficulty in locating specific sections based on the section and chapter breakdown.
__label__1	Poor Tess: Thia is the saddest story I have ever read! Poor girl---she doesn't have a chance with finding a happy life! The cards are all stacked against her from the git-go!
__label__1	Couldnt get to the story: I thought the story line sounded interesting so i bought it...twice! Trying to get a version of the book that wasnt so diffucult to read, its ok off and on, half the time i dont know what the author is referring to cause it was written so long ago that the author uses that language and it just got in my way of the story, which is why i bought it again thinking the 2nd book looked easier to read but it wasnt...sadly i will be reduced to trying to find the movie to find out what happens and it bothers me because i hate to not finish a book!
__label__2	Good book: This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again.
__label__2	Classical perfection: Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.
__label__2	Excellent!: Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!
__label__2	Haunting...: I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important.
__label__2	Wonderful: This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later. The characters are intriging, and the story is interesting, making me not want to put it down. I (being only in high school) would definitly suggest that you read it.
__label__2	"Excellent, timeless analysis of human life and nature: Please ignore the immature high-school student reviews and understand that this book is a masterpiece. Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental! This is one of the best books I have read and believe me, I have read a lot of the ""good"" books."
__label__1	Reality lessons for Thomas Hardy: How nice. Tess is a totally unrealistic character-she has more sorrow in her life then most of us have in a century. This book is extremely sad, and I don't understand why it's a classic. Tess is very happy until her alchoholic dad discovers that they were a noble family, so, getting to big for his britches, he sends Tess over to another D'urberville family, which actually just adopted the name because they wanted to seem influential. That's when the trouble starts. Soon, Tess gives birth to a baby, and goes back home in disgrace. Then she meets another nice guy, who abandons her when he learns of her past. They author could have done with some happpy scenes...life's not all sadness!
__label__1	"KILL ME, PLEASE: either me or the 12 grade teacher who assigned this piece of crap. This book was so terrible no one is my class read it, out teacher would have to come to class with 25 photocopies of the pages we were going over because no one would ""remember"" to bring thier book to class. As a story it was poigent and overdone, as a character, Tess was an insult to women everywhere. She had no backbone unill the end of the novel. fankly, I liked Hardy's poetry better and wish this book would be removed from all required reading list."
__label__1	Bad cover condition: Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!
__label__1	Cruel and Depressing Novel: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
__label__2	Once and Twice taken!: After many years of reading and prodding classics in my courses, Tess of the Durbervilles was not at all a book I wanted to read. But obliviously, I had to read it...and Lucky I had to because Tess is one of the best of English literature! Such a masterpiece! Such a creation! Such a tale!
__label__2	Love!: I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books. These classic books look awesome in a bookcase. I would highly recommend them.
__label__2	Great classic to read.: I purchased the movie and wanted to read the book also. It is sad as well, as I see life lessons in reading this book. It follows the film exactly, especially the beginning, in my opionion.
__label__2	Great!: Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!
__label__2	Tess by Tess: A sad tale for anyone to read - for a feminist like myself, it was heartbreaking. A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy.
__label__1	WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first!: My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1.
__label__1	THIS BOOK BLOWS: I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day.
__label__1	EAYK!: Silly, stupid, boring. I had to read it for a project and I was about to faint. Thank God that it was short:) Do you still wanna read it? Then good luck! I hate to say this but belive me you will be sorry for it!
__label__2	Daunting but Delightful: My quirky yet brilliant English teacher assigned this work in the beginning of my senior year. Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature.
__label__1	so boring.....: the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time.
__label__1	Sexist and unsatisfying: See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it.
__label__1	Waste of time.: I don't care if it's a classic. It went nowhere. There was no point. I could not bring myself to care what happened to the characters. It was not an enjoyable read.
__label__1	Amazon Affiliate: I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress.
__label__1	"Tess the Depressed!: I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the ""heroine"" she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."
__label__2	Fiction at its Finest: This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances.
__label__2	I recommend this: I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first.
__label__2	Classic literature everybody should read: This book is great history lesson, written with love and passion.Young people could learn many good things about relationship between woman and man.
__label__1	Disappointing: This poor character never catches a break, and the writer makes you care for her, deeply. Emotionally draining and depressing
__label__2	T Shirt Mania: This book was a perfect example of different ways to put together a little piece of an old or too small Tee Shirt with many memories built in one quilt.
__label__1	incorrect sewing instructions: There are so many T shirt quilt books out now and my friend happened to choose one that has incorrect sewing instructions. Her quilt would have been easier to make with another book. I have several T shirt quilt books that are very good with instructions.
__label__2	Great book: I used this book to make 3 T-shirt quilts in memory of a friend's 21 year old son and her 2 daughters. They turned out beautifully and looked so much more sophisticated and dignified that the simple sashing method. While the book may be thin it's big on creative ideas. I'm so thankful I found this book for these special quilts! I'm sure I'll be using it over and over again.
__label__1	Missing trademark lable on collectable item.: Item didn't have the trademark lable on it as shown in photo and is not a collectable item to me.Dissapointed with the item as I am a collector and it makes this item useless to me as far as my collection goes.Now it will cost me more money to purchase this item from Ebay.
__label__2	This is one of the best toys we have!: Hi, Today we went to toysrus and picked up this puppy surprise. And we LOVE it!When we opend it up every one was excited to see how many puppys it would have. (including Mom!) And we got 2 girls and 1 boy :) Of all the reviews I read everybody said they got 3 or 4 puppys, I never herd of someone getting 2. Well Im going to go play with my puppys, bye :)- Jackie
__label__2	Interactive CD!: My kids cannot keep quiet when this CD is playing, but neither can I. Keep your ears open and see if you can hear the clues! This CD rarely is in its case we play it so much.
__label__2	"Perfect for every Blue's Clues fan and their parents: I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this CD. But my 2 year old is a huge fan of the show, so I took a gamble and that CD doesn't owe me a nickel. It is just as clever as the TV show with the same format. The new songs are entertaining for both of us and the old stand bys are there so he can sing along. It is terrific. The only problem is there is only one ""episode"" on the market. Please hurry and make another one!! I think we know this one by heart!!!"
__label__2	Absolutley great for the kids!: My son loves to listen to the tape. It had wonderful songs and it really involves the kids. I must admit that I too love to listen.
__label__2	Better than the traditional kind: This is my second pair of Fiskar multi-purpose scissors. I got the first pair 6 years ago and used them constantly in my art studio for all kinds of cutting. They worked perfectly until I accidentally stepped on them. These scissors are extremely comfortable, stay sharper than the traditional kind, and work beautifully.
__label__1	PHOTO SHOWN WAS NOT ITEM SHIPPED.: THE FISKARS SOFTOUCH SCISSORS THAT WERE SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE WERE NOT THE ITEMS THAT WERE SHIPPED. I WAS SHIPPED THE 'NEWER' VERSION OF THE SAME ITEM. I WANTED THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN AND EXPECTED IT. I DO NOT LIKE THE HANDLES OF THE 'NEWER' VERSION AND WANTED THE OLDER ONES, AS I WAS LOOKING AT ON THE SITE. UPDATING YOUR SITES WOULD SAVE EVERYONE MORE TIME AND EFFORT!
__label__1	PURE JUNK, FELL APART, DAMAGED MY BIKES: This rack is a piece of junk. Within 1,000 miles, a part has fallen off, the pin bent, the frame sagged, and has rubbed my $2,000 mountain bike frame down to the aluminum. DO NOT BUY THIS RACK.For the initial journey, I put only three bikes on it for a long trip. The weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed. After my first leg, I pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly. So much so, I removed all bikes to ensure the rack was not failing. I found the pin bent only after 400 miles! As my trip went on, the rack continued to disintegrate. The rubber frame protector holding the frame to my bike fell off (don't ask me how as it was snuggly fitted to my oversized mountain bike frame). The metal to metal rubbing destroyed my paint and rubbed through my hydraulic brake line. My kids' bikes were also rubbed, dented, and scratched.Buy any other rack but this one. I personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes.
__label__1	Swagman XC-2 Bike Rack: I bought this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The rubber tubs are sticky and you need to wear gloves and it leaves marks on your bikes. The red rubber protecter fell off the first time it was used. The lock that was recommedned to go with it does not fit. When the tubes are locked in place you need a hammer to get them to release. The tire holder rails will not lock in place even with a pliers. I used the product as instructed in the manual and my bike fell off in the middle of an intersection! If you use this product than you need to bungi your bike in three places to secure it! Do Not just use the hooks!
__label__2	Great Bike Rack: Bought this rack on Monday and it got here on Tuesday. Took about 30-45 minutes to put it all together. Once I figured out that I had to take some parts apart to put them back together on the rack base, it all went well. I love how the bikes mount and feel that the bikes are more secure than on the type of racks that the bikes hang from the top tube. I would defiantly recommend this bike rack.
__label__2	"great carrier for distances: We just finished with a trip to visit family and it worked great. Around 500 miles each way.It took about an hour to get it adjusted so I could get all 4 bikes on at once. After that, everything was set and I loaded 4 bikes in 10-15 minutes. I'm sure I'll get even better.The only improvement they could make would be to have two posts with more space. The middle 2 bikes fit really tight so you have to put them in just right. It was harder because my son has a BMX style bike and our daughter has a similar bike with 16"" (I believe) wheels. Those fall through the mounts, but it stays in there securely anyway.My arms don't lock in the down position very easily, but I only use that for storage so I'm not worried. I'd probably buy it again, especially for the price."
__label__2	Swagman Bike Rack: Very well made and solid (heavy). Not the sort of rack you would want to pull on and of your vehicle by yourself very often. If you want a rack where you don't worry about your bikes swinging in the breeze this is it. The rack does fold up so it doesn't stick out the back too badly when the bikes aren't on. The receiver pin tightens to take out the slop between the hitch and the rack.
__label__2	"Dance album of the year!: Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
__label__1	"as silly as the cover: I liked the first single ""How Did You Know"", so I decided to check it out.The songs and productions sound flat and unimaginative, nothing too new or exciting here.I cant remember even one of the songs. Sounds like they needed to throw this one together fast...and the rap made me chuckle."
__label__2	Must have more!: After reading Ms. Bluehorse's most recent book, Grandfather's Drum, I searched for other titles by her and found this one - The View From the Hill. While completely different from Grandfather's Drum, I feel that The View From the Hill is a mile stone in modern historical literature. Elizabeth writes so clearly, so expressively, so beautifully. She is a delight to read - even when her words are bringing tears to your eyes. Elizabeth, we need more or your books!
__label__2	Yoga as Power: I am fortunate to be a student in Naader's yoga classes at Yoga Kingdom in Pasadena, CA. As someone who has studied yoga on and off for 25 years, i can confidently say that Naader's class is the most complete and well-rounded I have ever taken. For those in other parts of the world who would like access to an energizing, healing yoga workout, I would highly recommend this video.
__label__2	Remains powerful even with repeated viewing: Naader was my first yoga teacher. When we moved out of state, this video was my link to the best yoga routine I have ever done. I tried other instructors and other videos, but Naader's approach is the best -- a balanced mix of yoga instruction and inspiration. I have shared this tape with many friends (who then bought their own copy!) and they all agree that Naader's instructions are easy to follow and the pace is slow enough that beginners can figure out what is going on before the next pose; but not so slow that experienced students get bored. Furthermore, since he is doing the poses along with the student, he knows just when to offer that extra word of encouragement when you are about to give up! I find something new to ponder each time I listen to this tape. Naader's words are from the heart and they reach out to touch your heart as well as your body. Buy this tape and use it!!
__label__2	disposable nipples: This is a great product overall. I was looking all over the place to buy these from stores but could not find it anywhere. My wife and I wanted to use these because the baby had used them while in the hospital and there is no washing or maintenance involved. However they are a bit pricey and the flow is fast relative to other nipples.
__label__2	Great Disposable Nipples: I used these in the hospital when my baby was born and they are great!Now I have them in my baby bag along with the formula bottles and I always have a clean nipple when we are out. I recommend them.
__label__2	Best Disposable Nipples: I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles.
__label__2	The absolute best!: I have a VERY picky 4 month old who refuses to eat using any kind of nipple other than these. These are what they started him on in the hospital and although they are supposed to be disposable, we have been able to use nothing else since (despite numerous purchases of other brands to try with him.)
__label__2	One Leg Willie highly reccomends this CD! Classic BLUES: Hey, I've only got one leg, but that doesn't mean I don't know GREAT blues music when I hear it!!! I love Memphis Minnie and her rough and roudy vocals and rockin' guitar style, she is the epitime of the BLUES. She sings everything from jump blues, rockin' blues, delta blues to dirty blues. She has plenty of pep and energy, and sinsg liek there's no tomorrow. her delivery will hit you like an intoxicatingly wonderful tornado. You will love this cd, one Legged Willy promises, there you have it, THE ONE LEGGED WILLY GAURENTEE!!!Bottom Line: Just buy it, one legged Willy gives it the thumbs up!
__label__2	"Best Dirty Irish Cd ever ;): Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing."
__label__2	Race To mars: very realistic and fantastic movie, a must for all mars enthusiests like me. Great graphics and The planet just aches out for me to be on and explore
__label__1	Piece of junk: I have four of the outdoor units that are as good as a paperweight. At over $200 a piece, I've wasted over $800 on these. Don't waste your money. I've never wrote a review on any product before, and I've bought a lot of things off of Amazon, but these are the worse items that I've ever bought. Avoid at all cost.

__label__2	A Wonderful Shared Experience About Living In A Different Culture: Bruce Feiler shares his experience as a new teacher in Japan and how he accommodates himself to the culture of Japan and its school system. The book includes many humorous episodes as well as studies in how to adapt to new surroundings and to people who have different behaviors from those of our own. The reader will develop a greater appreciation for the way in which the Japanese education system works at the levels described in the book and in how one must develop a thick skin and a great sense of humor in order to be accepted when traveling or working overseas. The characters in this book are real and are brought to life on paper quite effectively. This is a story of shock, adaptation, and, ultimately, but with a lot of hard work - success.
__label__1	"A waste of paper.: This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
__label__1	Upsetting: I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
__label__1	It would be misleading to say this is typical of a JET Programme experience: There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self.
__label__2	A rare look from the bottom.: An unusual view of Japanese society. Seen not as usual through the eyes of a tourist, journalist, or other professional observer, but from the viewpoint of someone living there. Mr Fieler must not only learn a new job, but a new culture.
__label__2	Outdated but insightful: The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'.
__label__1	"Pretentious: ""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."
__label__2	"Worthy addition to the bookshelf: Stumbled across this recently and found it an agreeable and on-target accound of life in Japan, based on my own experience. Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) ""teaching in Japan from the male perspective"" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner."
__label__1	"Sarcasm and fabrications: I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."
__label__2	An investigation into the nature of relationships: Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity.
__label__1	The unbearable lightness of being: This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere.
__label__1	Highly overrated: It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film.
__label__1	Constipated: I have no idea how I was talked into watching this movie. I totally believe this was a waste of good film-and a lot of it. A young Daniel Day Lewis with a hipper Fonz impersonation and a whiney Juliette Binoche. Only Lena Olin was worth watching, but not for any depth or anything. This film actually made a communist invasion dull. I absolutely didn't care for this couple. Below par acting, horrible direction, terrible editing, annoying soundtrack and dialogue so bad I think someone should take away the screenwriter's guild card. Don't waste your time on this one.
__label__1	"the ubearable pain to watch: This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore. This is porn for those who would never confess that they watch porn. If you want to see a good movie about human relations, go get ""Besieged"" by Bertolucci."
__label__1	"Take off your cloth: This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!"
__label__1	Is This A Movie?: I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)
__label__2	High class, well made, cinematic masterpiece!: I could go on and on about the various aspects of quality in this film...I will leave that for other reviewer's of this film. I would just like to add it is a beautiful masterpiece, complete in every way. An experience of old cold war Czechoslovakian lovers...there is tension, sadness, love scenes of high taste and quality throughout the film. Even a special few minutes when every woman watching the sequence on screen, would probably be a lesbian for the day. Its not about sex...its all about living a full life and loving someone deeply...buy this film and sit back and enjoy it...bring a handkerchief along for the ending.
__label__2	question: This is one of my all time favorite movies. One question. A previous reviewer said don't buy the DVD because it was missing scenes. Was he refering to the Criterion Collection version?
__label__1	"One Great Big Sleeper: I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
__label__1	"Either you get or you don't..I didn't.: This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time."
__label__2	"The Unbelieveable Genius of Philip Kaufman: A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable."
__label__2	Unique: Abstracting to connect: I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams.
__label__1	Read the book - it takes less time!: The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film.
__label__1	Kundera was right to object: The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society.
__label__2	"Length makes the ""lightness"" feel heavy: Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story's interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch."
__label__2	The best film nobody saw: The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with.
__label__1	A wispy shadow of Kundera's book...: Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying.
__label__1	The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring: This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow.
__label__2	"Threesome with tanks: Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals.No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little.Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in.Well, movie spirit seems being similar to ""A Beautiful Life"", ""Producers"" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only."
__label__1	"So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too?: Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge."
__label__1	"Extremely Let Down: While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try ""Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry."
__label__1	What a stink: I used this cutting board in my sewing class and loved it. No odor at all from the one in class.I got my mat and it smelled as though I had hit a skunk. My husband made me put it on the back porch. Then I learned that a friend of mine had one for 8 months and hers still stinks. Her husband won't let her use it inside. I went online and read that others had found the same odor problem from these Olfa mats. Some said that the smell diminished after a few weeks but others said it has never stopped stinking.I e-mailed the Olfa distributor to ask if the company has other suggestions. I may just have to send it back.Great cutting mat if you don't mind a strong toxic smell.
__label__2	Love this petit kitchen: I love this little kitchen. We might have to buy something bigger because we have so many kitchen pots, pans, food and such....but we will still hang onto this kitchen. My 3 kids love it! Also, it can be assembled in minutes!
__label__1	Repeated book material & out of place reviews: Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)
__label__1	"Wow: Although Poul Anderson is not a typically a particularly bad writer, most of the prose in his portion of the book ""Pele"" is so bad as to be laughable. ""Tyra had more and more enjoyed her voyage, until near the end."" and ""The last weekly dance of the trip became an especially gleeful occasion."" I didn't even have to look very hard to come up with these gems. ""Memory stabbed her again."" Ha!It's almost as if it English was the author's second language.If you like authors that torture the English language you'll love this book."
__label__1	Man Kzin IX: After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors.
__label__2	A Must Have for Your Christmas Collection: This album has been in our family for generations and each Holiday Season we try to play it to bring back wonderful memories. I would highly recommend this for your Christmas Library. This album brings back happy times as a young child and rembering how wonder the Christmas season is when Family and friends are close.
__label__1	Disappointment: The drive lasted 3 days before the flash fell off and was lost from the encasement. The encasement was examined and appeared to be flimsy plastic. I don't recommend this product based on a lost unit.
__label__2	Good: Works fine. Easy to install. Some reviews talk about not fitting wall plates. Designed for the plate supplied to fit over the existing plate so plate supplied is over sized for a reason.
__label__2	This is made well and strudy, but will wear out.: Hard to find a better direct-wire wall timer of this quality. HOWEVER, this is the third one I have purchased so be warned that they will eventual ware out. The timer will eventual stop counting down and get stuck, leaving your device always on. I have mine hooked to turn off a wall heater in the bathroom. It works well for that. NOTE: Even though it will eventual ware out, they usually last a few years before they do. So yes, they are worth the price. BE WARNED: If the start waring out replace immediately as they will get stuck in the ON position... Thus, 4 stars.
__label__2	it does it's job: I read the reviews before buying this product and one review said it made loud nose as dial turns.. and s/he is completly right. The noise it makes is pretty loud.. I would NOT recommend this for the bedroom if you are going to use it as some type of sleep timer b/c the noise will bother you. However, I have this installed on my storage room in the kitchen, so the noise is not an issue.
__label__2	Great produt easy to install: great product to save money! Dont worry about leaving the light on anymore. It is easy to install and instructions are straight forward
__label__2	it worked!: I'm replacing the exact same dealiwhop that started to stick / not turn off after several years of use. Install was easy.
__label__1	For Simple Minds: I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
__label__2	Karen's Review: Living in Chaos is Living in Stability is truly a book that has inspired me to be more aware of my spirituality and has shown me many ways to do this. It is a book that has brought peace to my heart having read it right after September 11, 2001. If you are searching for more meaning in your life and comfort of your soul, this book is an excellent choice.
__label__1	"Wow...: This is one of the worst books ever. It tries to capitalize on the Chicken Soup for the Soul-type, void of any substance stories. This was not written by the author and takes advantage of people around her by publishing stories from them. With no new insight, Samira, a strictly amateur writer, doesn't contribute anything. Fortunately, it's by a vanity publisher and the only people who buy it are her friends (who posted here from ""Grand Blanc"" and ""Michigan"" because Samira asked them to) and a few people who found it online. Please people, avoid this book, buy something that will be worth your time and money."
__label__2	Eye Opening!: The book changed my boundaries. I have become aware of my limitations and now I truly believe that these boundaries are not limitations but gifts in disguise. I realized the importance in one's short comings is the lesson that it presents for the seeker. Thank-you.
__label__2	enlightening and very practical book: This is a very hopeful and enlightening book as the various thoughts and stories help us to look at life in a more positive way, which can only improve quality of our lives. It made me realize to be aware of the world around me and to learn to appreciate things and people in our lives. We usually live our lives in such hustle and bustle that we overlook the many experiences and people that we face in our daily lives. In the stories of the common everyday people in the book, we realize that we are not alone, that there are factors beyond us which are involved and that we should be open to them and not overlook our experiences.This book is very easy to read and understand and each chapter stands by itself. You can open up any chapter at any time and with the thoughts and the connected stories of real people, you can find enlightenment.A wonderful book, full of hope and insight.
__label__1	The official company biography -- dated, aging, but interesting.: This is the only official history of the giant utility that serves most of northern and central California. Written in 1950, when the company (and its official biographer) were heedless of the changes that the future held in store for the energy industry overall (and utilities in particular) as well as for the end of unbridled growth and development in the state of California. Coleman is a real booster for PG&E. If you want the PR line, from the generation that build the company between 1930 and the 1950, this is the reference book you want.
__label__1	did not work: I was installing these chips in a G4 Sawtooth macintosh computer and the chips did not work. I had kernel panics that eventually left the operating system unusable. The hard drive had to be reformatted and the OS re-installed. A great headache and PITA. I need to return these memory modules, how would I do that.best regards,vilppu
__label__2	Good for the price: I bought this product for my old Dell Dimension XPS-T450 to extend its usefulness. As I was unaware of that the maximum RAM for each slot was 256MB, the computer read as 256MB instead of 512MB. With the seller's outstanding assistance I successfully installed two replaced 256MB memories to get total 512MB, the system is now working fine and steadily. It is worth spending $28 to keep the old computer working as an experimental machine.
__label__2	Great for sensitive skin: I have extremely sensitive skin.Regular soaps cause me to break out in a rash.I love this product it has no harsh chemicals and is Fragrance Free.It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth not dry and irritated.I even use it on my face and I noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.If you have problem skin or sensitive painful skin I suggest you try this product I'm happy I did.
__label__2	You don't have to speak french to love this cd!: While visiting Quebec City, I heard her CD playing in a clothing store. I asked who the artist was, walked to the music store down the street and bought it. If you like Jewel, Tori Amos, Alanis Morisette, etc. you'll LOVE this. I'm now buying several more through amazon.com for my sister and a couple friends for X-mas because they heard my CD and LOVED it. Can't find it in any US stores...yet! It's mainly in French, but her voice and the music is so good, it doesn't matter.
__label__1	Completement nul: Fait sur commande et ennuyant a mourir, cette album est tout a fait parfait pour s'endormir...nul!
__label__2	"Smoke Rings: This is an excellent album. The title track Smoke Rings is exceptional. It was the band's closing theme song. All the tracks have a uniqueness to them. Well worth having in your music collection. The track ""My Heart Tells Me"" has some very beautiful vocals by band-vocalist Eugenie Baird. It also contains one of the great songs from the 30's ""A Hundred Years From Today"" sung by Lee Wiley. Her voice and the band make such a great song even better. Take a magical trip back in time and purchase this great album!!!"
__label__1	old music: Music from the 30's and very nostalgic. My father played with this band when he was still in college in 1934.
__label__1	Horrible: This book is terrible. The writing is terrible, the art is terrible (obviously terrible, too: one of the dragons' heads was obviously photoshopped onto another dragon's body on another page), the story is boring, it's just... bad. It's anti climatic, and throughout the story it's just hardship after hardship of them attempting to kill dragons. I found it hard to finish just skimming it.
__label__1	Proceed with caution: This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel.
__label__1	You can't be sure what you're getting: I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive. The samples are REALLY random, so you may not get ones you actually wanted to try. Most of the ones I got were things I wasn't interested in. And I didn't get the shampoo sample. They say you can return it for a refund, less shipping and handling, but the shipping and handling were double the cost of the product itself.
__label__2	Very good: I ordered 2 sets of samples. Everything came in time, & I was very pleased. The seller even included a ton of free extras too, which I was very happy about :]. The products themselves are 'pretty good'. I recommend the shampoo/conditioner & the foaming face wash [my favorite]. Overall, a very good seller. I'll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average. The eye moister jell was also very good too.
__label__2	Great selection: This pack comes with a wide variety of products. It is a great introduction to the Komenuka line. I really enjoyed how clean my skin felt after using the cleanser. The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy. I would recommend this line to anyone.
__label__2	"Excellent postcards!: These are wonderful postcards for any dog and/or animal lover. The photos are very well-done and the dogs are adorable.As the previous reviewer stated, the postcards are black and white pictures of dogs with a short bit of information on the back including the photographer, title and date of the photograph and a short bit of information on the dog in the photo.They are printed on thick 6"" x 6"" cardstock, which will make them durable in the mail (if you intend to mail them). However, it should be noted that at this size, the postcards mail at letter rate and not postcard rate."
__label__1	Underwhelming: What we have here is an academic paper puffed into a book.If one has the patience to wade through his tedious repetitions, condescensions, ax grinding, and self-congratulations, one is rewarded with the glimmer of a new idea. But that idea, recedes mirage-like, ever into the horizon. I don't know how I ever made it through.It's disappointing that Kingsley fails to locate his work within the context of Ganzfeld parapsychology, or even of Sumer, the source culture of the ancients. I was amused to find that despite what he believes to be his breakthrough insights, he is ignored by other scholars.Nice try, Peter, but you owe us much better. Next time, at the very least, give us a useful table of contents, a readable list of references, and an index.
__label__1	A Non-Fiction Version of the DaVinci Code: A tiresome meander through bits & pieces of ancient history and philosophy to try to prove, once again, that there is a great effort to keep humans from realizing their potential and the secret wisdom that was revealed in former times. Dull, pedantic and unfocused.
__label__2	reads like a novel: ...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't.
__label__2	teachers tool: As techers we should learn more by reading now a days and this is a good book that helps you and gives you ideas about how to elaborate your rubrics.
__label__2	Extremely comprehensive reference to the language of surgery: THIS REFERENCE OF OVER 1000 PAGES IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED TO TRANSCRIBE SURGICAL REPORTS.
__label__2	PERFECT FOR EVERY MEDICAL OFFICE: THIS REFERENCE BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED IN MY DAILY WORK AS A MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTIONIST. I FIND IT VERY USEFUL EACH DAY.
__label__2	The BEST for MT: I'm an MT with 20+ years of experience and own most of the Stedman books, which are quite helpful. However, when I cannot find a term in Stedman's, this is the reference I reach for. I cannot tell you how many times this little gem has saved me from lengthy searches for a term. Grab yourself a copy, you won't regret it.
__label__1	Manhattan Transfer can't sing!: I can't understand how Manhattan Transfer gets all those studio musicians to play on their albums. I mean, it just makes their singing sound worse against the best drumming (Steve Gadd), bass playing and sax playing in the world. The two stars are for Kafka and the studio musicians only.
__label__2	ISS Research Creatine. Good Product: I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS. EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU.
__label__1	"A worthless book: I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: ""you are now all dumber after hearing this story"". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal."
__label__1	Snowbore: Don't get me wrong, this is a totally enjoyable listen, but is it just me or is every single song on the disc the same. Hell, they're even the same as on Cold & Bouncy, Hawaii and Gideon Gaye. The one thing that makes this album different is John McEntire's wonderful production and the 'Lab girls. If you dont own any High Llamas disc, start here... but if you already do, dont expect anything new.
__label__2	snowbug while snowboarding: i live in mt.shasta, california where i go snowboarding all the time. with headphones on the music of the high llamas is inspirational. to slide down the hill while listening to the llamas is like nothing else in the world. if you think driving in your car while listening is fun, try strapping on a board, hitting the powder and listening to the best high llamas cd yet, snowbug
__label__2	Number 1 in the Tom Gill chart for a year: You won't find a more relaxing, or a more intriguing album than this one. This is where the High Lamas peaked -- even better than Cold and Bouncy and far better than the disappointing Buzzle Bee that followed. It's cool... it's cute. Best in summer perhaps. I listen to it all the time. My 9-year old daughter loves it too, but my 12-year-old son hates it. He's into Aerosmith and the like...
__label__2	Frightening, relevant and persuasive: I was most struck with the information about what happens to us physically when we watch television. The very act of watching itself, without reference to content, changes the way our brains operate. I recommend this to all teachers, parents, and broadcast journalists.
__label__2	helps in understanding children: For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!
__label__2	Learn what children really loose when they watch TV.: This is the classic book on how television affects our children and families. Just think about how children really learn and how families should interact.Although this book was originally written closer to the dawn of television in our culture, things really haven't changed much.Ms. Winn had a great perception early on about how harmful television would be to children and their families. Check it out or better yet buy it from Amazon while you are here.
__label__2	"who's the archeologist?: The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the ""Lost Cities"" series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself ""a rogue archeologist"": someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition."
__label__2	"Interesting book, a little more detail would be nice.: This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."
__label__2	Great!: This book is amazing! I ordered this book from barns and Nobel on line then 2 days later they sent an e-mail telling me it did not go through. So A friend told me to go to amazon! I will only go to amazon now it was so simple a Kid could do it! I LOVE AMAZON!
__label__2	Did the Egyptians Colonize North America?: I was amazed by this book: The author, while travelling from Central America to Canada provides evidence for North America being colonized by Egyptians, Chinese, Phoenecians and other ancient civilizations. The most amazing part of the book was the story of an Egyptian city in the Grand Canyon. Childress reproduces the actual Arizona newsclippings from 1909. Like his other books, this one is richly illustrated, far-out and fun to read!
__label__1	Boring: I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk.
__label__2	Buddhist Enlightenment: On the peaks of the High Siera, Kerouac's narrator, Japhy Ryder explores the inner nuances of one's thought processes and being, away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay area's consternative environs. Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it. A great read showing the inner exploration and sanctity with which Kerouac grounded his Bohemian lifestyle.
__label__2	one of kerouac's finest: I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough.
__label__2	"Makes me want to go hiking!: This is the 2nd Kerouac book i've read (the first was ""Maggie Cassidy"") - and i found it enlightening and entertaining.It tells the story of a few young men and their lifestyle - that of a Dharma bum. The have very few possessions which they kepe is small shacks or in backpacks, and spend their time discovering nature and the dharma in this world.Kerouac's writing style varies - in certain parts it seems like pure fiction (describes parties, characters' interactions with family, etc.), at some points it seems very philisophical (i learned a bunch about Buddhism), and at some points it is just very descriptive (i live in NYC, and it made me miss nature.)There were a few parts that were ""wordy,"" but overall this book reads quickly and is very enjoyable."
__label__2	"Read Me Read Me Read Me: Pretend that you've ever heard of Jack Kerouac. Forget you've ever heard the words ""Beat Generation."" Set down your ideas of what life should be like. Read this book. It will make you want to sell all your worldly possessions in a mammoth yard sale and take off to find It."
__label__2	Simple, Beautiful Novel about the Rucksack Generation: Dharma Bums is a beautiful story, though there's no real plot to speak of -- no damsel in distress, no hero facing adversity, no complicated twists . . . it's just about life.The reader follows the typical Kerouac rucksacker as he floats along in his mid-twenties -- hiking the mountains of the west coast, thumbing his way across the country and swapping spiritual observations with Zen enthusiast and companion Japhy Ryder.This book is a treasure, reminding the reader of the subtle beauties in nature, conversation, travel and friendship. It's a perfect fit for any fan of life.
__label__2	"Best Kerouac: This is timeless and inspiring. i buy it for many people who think Kerouac is just ""On the Road"" ."
__label__2	My favorite Kerouac: If you are of a certain age and experience, you already know about Dharma Bums.If you are of another certain age and experience, this book goes against everything taught by Saint Ronald Reagan, and so you should avoid it.If you are young, give this book a try. Better yet, instead of buying it, go to the local library to read it. Unless the people I described in my second paragraph have taken over and there are only Approved Books in the library...if there are libraries at all. Libraries cost money, and that means (shudder) taxes.For everyone else: this is Kerouak's best work.
__label__1	"Well...: I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best."""
__label__1	Buddihism book for introspective thought: This is Jack jumping into the Budda scene. Good if you feel like you need a Zen fix, and his observations on how to aspire to happiness are actually quite good too.
__label__2	Blah: Another wonderful, practically edge-of-conscious novel with no definite plot by everyone's favorite perfectly insane Beat writer. In many ways I enjoy this book even better than 'On the Road.' It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers. Kerouac has perhaps more real-life affect on his readers than any other American novelist, one of the few writers anywhere who really can change lives. Blah.
__label__1	Not As It Would Seem: Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
__label__2	VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION!: Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.
__label__2	"This is Kerouac's real masterpiece!!: I didn't much care for ""On The Road"" after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great ""Beat Writer"" was nothing but hype, but after reading ""The Dharma Bums"" I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
__label__2	"A pefect battle of religion, alcohol, and poetry.: Published only a year after his masterpiece On The Road, Dharma Bums is a visionary look at the debilitating effects of fame and alcohol. It follows Ray Smith (Jack) and Jahy Rider (Gary Snyder) on a buddhist romp through the mountains of the west coast. Contemplating their religions and beliefs and coming to beautiful realisations about the world (""You can't fall off a mountain""), they create the rucksack revolution. A beautiful insight into thought and poetry. A must for anyone who wants to learn to think or expand their mind."
__label__1	"I'm gonna get blasted for this, but...: ... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
__label__1	"On the Road Again.: Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book. If you've read ""ON THE ROAD"", maybe you'll want read something diferent. This is the same book, the same drama, the same wasted money. Can this book change your life?? Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
__label__1	The Kindle version costs more than the paperback: As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!
__label__1	Don't bother: I tried to give Kerouac a chance to revive himself after reading his most notable mess 'On the Road.' Now I'm thoroughly confused as to why he's so popular.
__label__1	Kerouac is not that great: Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing.
__label__1	Failed to be powerful...or even interesting: One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know.
__label__1	Shallow: I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better.
__label__1	Conceited book: Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer. This book is filled with the resemblance of substance, but has nothing in it. It is a contradiction of itself.
__label__1	One show about nothing is enough: OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac.
__label__1	Bummer: Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it.
__label__2	"I wanted to say ""Damn!"": ...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey."
__label__2	"Excellent follow-up to ""On the Road"": ""The Dharma Bums"" is an excellent follow-up to Jack Kerouac's famous second novel, ""On the Road,"" a must-read for all Kerouac fans. Pay special attention to the infamous mountain climb by Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and John Montgomery--lots of great imagery, language, and central themes of life there. This book changed my life forever. It also contains the famous poetry reading (where Allen Ginsberg read ""Howl"") at 6 Gallery in San Francisco (Oct. 7, 1955)."
__label__2	"a different Kerouac: A more laid back series of tales from the life of Jack Kerouac. Very relaxing, unlike ""On the Road"". Makes you want to go climb a mountain."
__label__2	Good read: Great read. If you have something mote profound to read I would suggest that. All in all a great story though.
__label__2	"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it!: Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
__label__1	Dont waste your time: Uninteresting and boring, the story accomplishes nothing from start to finish. Save your time and money and dont bother with this book.
__label__1	"Sometimes it works: At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."
__label__2	A must-have for any theological library: This is THE definitive book on Reformed Presbyterian theology. Hodge is strong not only in what he explains, but also how he explains it. Each section is divided into questions, as if someone was interviewing Hodge. He then answers each question in a very logical, ordered manner, giving the reader a very clear perception of each particular concept. Hodge leaves nothing uncovered, but rather touches on a very wide spectrum of Reformed theology, and every time his argument is succinct and backed with scripture. Everyone interested in theology, clergy or lay-person, should read this book to gain a deeper understanding of what the Reformed persuasion believes and why.
__label__1	Great book, but not this Kindle edition: There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form.
__label__1	Poor Kindle edition: My negative comments have nothing to do with the content as Hodge wrote it, which is excellent. But the quality of the Kindle edition is very poor. The OCR scan has resulted in unintelligible words in almost every paragraph, and the lack of links in the table of contents severely limits the usefulness as a reference source. It's not completely useless; in general I can find what I'm looking for and make sense out of the text. So for 99 cents I suppose I'm getting my money's worth. But an edition of better quality would be most welcome.
__label__1	horrid e-text: This kindle version is not worth the money, even if very cheap. It is a poor uncorrected ocr scan. It is unreadable and unusable. Find a cleaner edition. This is a rip-off.
__label__1	Tell me what you think: Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing.
__label__2	Workout CD: I don't really remember what's on this one. I purchased to install in my MP3 for walking/jogging and it's fine
__label__1	Plot? What Plot?: The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars.
__label__1	Just Not Worthwhile: I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one.
__label__1	Absolute trash.: I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed.
__label__1	WAIT!!: As you have read, wait for the deluxe version later in the year. So for now, just rent it for now!!!
__label__1	Wait for Special Edition: I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business.
__label__2	"Transformers - Dark of the Moon (Blu-ray): Continuous action and mayhem - it's hard to beat the initial Transformer movie (first one) but ""They"" again did an excellent attept."
__label__1	Dark Moon: Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad.
__label__2	Farily decent movie: I didn't like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good.
__label__2	blessed: it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?
__label__1	I didn't buy this movie because it was too dumb.: I think Michael Bay may have phoned this one in. There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to begin.
__label__1	DIRECTOR's PERSONAL SIGNATURE ......???????????: UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?
__label__1	you pay less at the theater: Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out.
__label__2	Best Transformers movie ever.: Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes.
__label__1	If you're 16+ don't bother: These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you.
__label__1	crappy acting: i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent
__label__1	no speacial features: This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant.
__label__1	Bogus - no special features - rent it, don't buy.: (SORRY...THIS IS FOR BLU-RAY, NOT AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO) Would have given 4 stars for the movie/blu-ray, but I was very disappointed there were no special features at all - not even notes. That's the main reason I like DVDs and blu-rays so much...for the special features that may contain commentary, interviews, behind the scenes and show how some of the FX were done - explosions and such. I'm sure they will release another version in the near future with the special features movie buffs enjoy and spend more cash$ Who the hell comes out with a new release Blu-ray in this day & age with ZERO special features??? DO NOT BUY - RENT FROM RED BOX.
__label__1	DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!!: Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!
__label__1	Not even rental worthy: Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow.
__label__1	Love 3D hate the Price.: who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick.
__label__1	that kid wit wickie yell like a woman all movie like he was pms ruin the movie.: the movie was bad the kid ruined it yellign and being angry the whole time. And it was the same as the last 2 movies nothing out very boring ending was ok.
__label__1	sucks: i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie
__label__1	kind of a pathetic dvd: I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one
__label__2	Great Movie: Purchased this dvd as a gift. It arrived well within the alloted time and was well packaged. Another good buy through Amazon, my place to shop! EP
__label__2	"Great movie can't wait for the Blu ray: I have seen this movie 2 times in theaters. Optimus Prime turns bad ass in this one when he says ""We will kill them all"". The wreckers are great as well as Sideswipe and Mirage. I strongly recommend."
__label__1	I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount: Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)
__label__2	Transformers: This was an okay movie. You must enjoy the Bay Transformers Universe in order to enjoy this film. Oh yeah, and big explosions.
__label__2	Transformer: Items waas as described and shipped on time. Was a gift and just what was asked for. Item was in very good condition.
__label__2	Transformers: This movie is a simply an action movie. It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else. But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie? With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice.
__label__2	Awesome movie: If you seen the first two you will definately find this one the best! We first seen it in 3D at the movies and knew how good it was. By far go get this movie. My youngest son is a Transformers freak, and we've seen this about 1,000 times since we bought it! Awesome Film!
__label__1	Uggh, such a waste of potential!: I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches.
__label__2	It was like awesome: Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. The movie was awesome and I can't say enough about the whole experiece.
__label__2	plenty of action and humor: consistent production quality like first two movies in the series..and like the other series movies,plenty of humor from the additional characters ( and first-rate actors) thruout the movie
__label__2	action: Great action movie, intense, demographics was awesome. Definitely a but movie to watch again, but with prime time i can without buying it!!
__label__2	Good movie: I like all of the transformers movies. This one is fun too. I would recommend it to any fan of the first two movies.
__label__1	"AVOID at all costs!!!: If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
__label__1	DONT DOUBLE DIP!! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERSION: This version is being rushed out at the end of this month. Michael Bay has stated that a Bigger and Better 3D bluray version will be released later, with ALOT more extras than this edition. That version will be release on standard Blu as well, Looks like before the end of this year, just in time for the holidays.
__label__2	Love Them All... But this is the best: I love all of the Transformer movies but I think this is the best one. Really well done. The only complaint is the absence of Megan Fox as the girlfriend. I mean how do you dump a guy you have saved the world with twice???
__label__1	Michael Bay should be barred from making more movies.: This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing.
__label__1	Digital copy is expired: Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included
__label__2	Great !!: So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!
__label__1	Suck it Michael Bay: Boobies, explosions, and maybe the fight/transformation scenes would have been awesome with theater version basss/surround sound. A waste of time. Unless you're drunk. Then it's ok.
__label__1	"Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time: Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
__label__1	"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"": I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."
__label__1	unwatchable: The first few Transformers movies had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. And still I actually managed to sit all the way through them. I got about 45 minutes into this one and couldn't go on. Awful.
__label__2	Great movie: Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching.
__label__1	Horrible: It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard.
__label__1	Dreadful: It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Big robots, smash smash smash. Whatever.
__label__1	Awful movie.: Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap.
__label__1	waste of time: continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good.
__label__1	Enough already: Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way.
__label__1	Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment: I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies.
__label__1	WAAAY TOO MUCH CG!: I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie.
__label__1	One of the worst movies ever.: The acting is horrible. The story is nonexistent. This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie. The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one.
__label__1	Bleh: It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude.
__label__1	Unwatchably boring: ~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Seriously, unintertained to the extent that I closed the browser. Honestly, though I've stopped watching a movie from lack of interest before, it's never been this bad. Also, the first forty minutes did not start up any comprehensible plot.
__label__1	Cant get narrator off !!!!!!!!! help !!! new dvd: I cant get the narrator off in the background.. I tried 3 different dvd players.. Anyone know how ? email me at gibby@sev.org.
__label__1	Transformers: I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting
__label__1	A waste of special effects . . .: and a complete waste of electricity. Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel.
__label__1	Avoid if you want ANY extra features.: First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time.
__label__1	Pathetic: Please find something else to do for two and half hours.There is are so many things wrong with this movie to list, but I will say there was one redeeming quality of the movie and that was actor John Malkovich.As I said I am not going to go into all the things that made this movie horrible, but I will say for just about two hours I was hoping it would end and every time I had enough, John did his thing and I was back to watching the movie.I had thought number two was bad but his one was even worse and lets hope that they never make another one.Timahh
__label__1	Kiddie Fodder...: Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague.
__label__2	best movie of the 3!!!: this was by far the best of the 3 movies. the human interaction is better and the robot battles are infinitely better. from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-stop action. this is one of the few movies i saw 2 times in the theater. once in the regular screen and once in imax 3D. it was money well spent. i would tell anyone who is thinking of buying it, to DEFINITELY buy it!
__label__1	Movie is horrible...: Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.
__label__1	No 3D Bluray in this release, no sale.: Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on.
__label__1	epic fail: very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed.
__label__1	This film gave me brain damage: First of all, its boring. At the 30 minute mark I forgot what movie I was watching. And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer.
__label__1	This movie is the definition of bad: Many of the reviews on here praise this movie for it's visual prowess. Personally I think that is like praising a brain dead super model. Yeah, it looks good and the action sequences are crazy. However, it has NO semblence of a plot. The movie as a whole is incoherent, disjointed, and just generally stupid. Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible. I don't know what the director was smoking when he inflicted this peice of shit on the world, but if you have half a brain you will find it as insufferable as I did. Don't waste your time.
__label__2	cool movie: i had never watched this movie and happened to start watching it with my company and found it to have great animation to it. would recommend to anyone.
__label__2	SciFi Movie: Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. However, not to be missed or overlooked as one of the btter robot wars themed movies.
__label__1	Avoid.. Falsely advertised: Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
__label__1	Terrible. Horrible. Awful movie.: Much too long, excruciatingly boring and all Shia LaBeouf does is scream for over 2 hours. I made the horrible mistake of actually BUYING this movie.
__label__1	Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise: I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie.
__label__1	Starts of with a bang but fades: I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie.
__label__1	"Redefinition of LAME: I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
__label__1	At least the special effects were fun: The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours.
__label__2	fabuloso: mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
__label__1	Waste of time: There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2 had none. Waste of time.
__label__1	So bad: The previews of this movie were the best things about it! The female lead's obviously surgically altered lips were distracting and the idea of people slamming into buildings and sliding through broken glass uninjured was laughable. The transformers were awesome but how long can you watch those scenes before enough is enough. So bad,so disappointing so save your money!
__label__1	This ... movie ... sucks: At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said.
__label__1	Lousy: This movie became so boring I stopped watching it after an hour and a half. I liked the first one much better.
__label__1	Geh: Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah.
__label__1	Boring: Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas
__label__1	Weak: I enjoyed the 1st Transformers movie for what it was. Found the 2nd to be unwatchable. This one is better than the second one but what is that saying.
__label__1	Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this movie is a disaster...: It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times.
__label__1	awful: This movie was terrible. No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either.
__label__1	Boring and Stupid: Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers movie look like Citizen Kane. I got about halfway through this movie before I had to stop watching. The plot was utterly nonsensical. I had no sympathy for any of the characters--the sooner Megatron kills Shia LeBoeuf the better--in my opinion. The action scenes were so convoluted, I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be happening nine times out of ten. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Michael Bay, Don't make another Transformers Movie.
__label__2	100% Satsified: The item arrived in perfect condition. The transaction was easy, convenient, and service was efficient. I've used this seller on other occasions and have never had a problem. I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend to others. In this case, I chose the seller because of good experience in the past, despite a slightly higher price-- and still a great bargain!
__label__1	Transformers: Dark of the Moon: This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way.
__label__2	The best so far: Great popcorn flick. Big difference between the dvd & bluray. The digital copy has been great since we own an iPad
__label__2	Transformers: Love it but not as good as the other 2. Shia is great as always and love the soundtrack also but that is just me. Very good graphics but I was really paying more attention to the story and ya gotta just love it when dictator obama is spliced into a movie as the good leader that he isn't and they made George W. Bush look like an idiot. But this is hollywood and they suck.
__label__1	Not more than meets the eye: 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it.
__label__1	Disappointing!: Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!
__label__1	I Wish I Could Give Zero Stars: This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund.
__label__1	A Time Waster: This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor Shia has to have a high paid model to make his acting look better.
__label__1	Not 3D: THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.
__label__1	"Painful 2 and a half hours: I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Wow was it ever worse than I thought it could be! Full of ""clever"" one-liners, bad characters (both humans and robots... really? There's an old British autobot named ""Q"" who designs fancy gadgets and weapons?), and action that was at times fun, but for the most part incredibly drawn out and ultimately just boring. Basically this was 2.5 hours (and it feels like 4) of unpleasantly spent time."
__label__1	Provincial: There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute.
__label__1	Transformers: Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies . I will keep the first Transformers movie and forget about the others that followed.
__label__1	"I fell asleep.: I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep."
__label__1	A bunch of CGI crap.....: The girl who replaces Megan Fox wears white the ENTIRE MOVIE, it borderlines stupidity. The movie is just garbage, I'm not gonna waste your time telling you every bad detail, but it almost seems that several things were done just to piss Megan Fox off completely ignoring story line.
__label__1	"Hmmmmm.: I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay."
__label__1	"Ugh!: The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
__label__1	Bad movie? You're soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague.
__label__1	This movie doesnt deserve any stars...: Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away.
__label__1	Disappointed: I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store.
__label__1	Ouch: In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes.
__label__1	Amazon video streaming does not work: Tried Amazon's video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work. We have watched many movies from Netflix so surprised when this did not work especially after paying $3.99. Looks like I need to go back to DVD rentals for new releases at the blockbuster kiosk.
__label__2	Review on the movie: Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained.
__label__2	Dark of the Moon DVD: Great value for money. I purchased this DVD for my son as he loves Transformers. Received the DVD before the estimated date and before it was due to be released in Australia.We were only interested in the movie(extras etc not a big deal for my son) so it was a very good buy.Quality of movie was good too.
__label__2	From Gods to Machines: I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads.
__label__2	best video ever!: THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE ANYONE WILL EVER SEE IN THEIR ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE! BEST MOVIE EVER! IT ROCKS!
__label__1	Dosen't play well: This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.
__label__2	AMAZING: Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that movie legit. Tons of laughs, emotion and of course the best action special affects you'll ever see. Definitely go see it if you loved the first 2 or even liked. You'll be into this one the whole way through
__label__1	Really boring and very flat 3D: I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue
__label__1	simply stupid: A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie.
__label__1	Yes, but no cigar: Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason.
__label__1	"Super...cynical!: Paramount has soared to new heights of ""vulture-ness,"" patiently sitting on a branch for the last sap to buy this on Blu-ray before conveniently swooping in on said saps with the 3-D release. (Can't remember if Thor hit theaters as a 3-D movie, but I think it did, and Paramount is using the same release strategy there.) Please resist this strategy fellow would-be saps. The movie is a solid 3 (couple of weak plot lines)...the release strategy gets it rated a weak 1!!"
__label__1	Poorly Made DVD: I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood.
__label__1	Pre-Order Screw Up: This review does not reflect anything about the movie. I pre-ordered this item Sept 22,2011 thinking I was going to get it as soon as it was released. Guess what? It's Oct 3rd and and I'm still waiting. Will update review as soon as get the movie. Update: Finally arrived 4:30pm Oct, 3rd.
__label__1	I saw this movie in 3-D: I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great.
__label__1	"Following in Peter Jackson's foot prints?: This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. You find in the case a coupon for the 3D version coming out ""Soon!"" Bite me Paramount. I'm taking this back for my money. Keep the coupon. What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people."
__label__2	GOOD PURCHASE!: I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!
__label__2	"It's ""OK"" but not as good as the first two.: Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that's for another review.) Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach. She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things. This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action. I still bought it but am kinda disappointed."
__label__2	awesome movie: This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.
__label__2	transformers: really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening
__label__2	"Dark of the Moon-What a blast!: First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From ""Bad Boys"" to ""The Island"",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and ""Transformers 3"" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work."
__label__2	Transformer: Very please with the product and time to receive the merchandise..Will definitely buy from Amazon in the future. Very pleased with the purchase.
__label__2	Expectacular Movie: The Movie is expectacular, amazingly directed and the visuals are well crafted, the visuals are very realistic, and a well budgeted film in 2011. Absolutely a collectors item.
__label__2	Not bad, not the best: I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her. I also thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Not really the way I would have ended the series. (to my knowledge, it was the last)
__label__2	optimal purchase: great to film in 3D optimal image ferso recommend to anyone who likes the film still in HD. . . .
__label__2	great movie: This is a great movie lots of action and intrege. Being the third movie in the series i was afraid it was gonna be a flop but it was a great movie after all.
__label__2	AMAZZZZIIIING QUALITY!!: This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie.
__label__1	The graphics were good, that's about it.: I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies. This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars. The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base. After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it. I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable.
__label__2	Solid popcorn flick: Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.
__label__2	Love the transformers series: Great movie series, fun to watch hope it continues with more sequels. This one was as good as the first ones.
__label__2	Dark of the Moon: I love this movie! The special effects are crazy and the storyline was interesting also. I highly recommend this movie.
__label__2	3D Rocks: This video is incredible in 3D. It was a gift for a relative and he absolutely loves it. Viewed on a 3D TV and 3D BluRay player, it was just like going to a movie on the big screen.
__label__2	Great movie: Thanks for the great price and movie. It was really good. But of course I love the 1st one the best.
__label__1	Not a good movie at all...stinks!!!: Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film.
__label__1	Nice show but wait for the 3D version: Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again.First version Theatrical version(normal length)Second Version Extended Cut
__label__1	Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo!: Booooo!Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously..
__label__1	The joke's on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan!: I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!
__label__1	It's time for human slaves to meet their masters!!!: And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!This movie is like a 2.5 hours car crash. When you think it can't get any worse - it does.It would deserve 2 stars if it didn't have any human actors. But Michael Bay is actually controlled by his computers, and they made him put these humans in this movie to make us suffer even more!!!This is all I have to say. Transformers IV is coming soon to the theaters near you. Preorder your tickets now!!!
__label__1	Held my interest for minutes at a time: Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot.
__label__1	"Just watch the first 10 minutes the rest is drying paint: 2 big complaints:1. great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes. No story to follow.2. Dumb girl, ""eek!"" Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines. Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she. She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart. Give her something! Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.One small complaint:The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal."
__label__1	Simply Awful: Painful to watch. Hopefully, this will be the last Transformers feature, with future funding going towards far more worthwhile projects.
__label__1	A 2 star movie at best & what a dog: I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket.
__label__2	Great movie: Unfortunately I had to return this movie. It was also a Christmas gift. Already had one.. My kids have one or I would have kept it..
__label__1	More of the same: The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the story line also is unfortunately what you expect. It's just more of the same disjumbled events getting thrown together. Some parts of the movie flow well, and others are just plain ridiculous. It's past time the writers & director for this series either move on or grow up and quit turning every scene into some kind of teenage behavioral prank. They've done the bumbling parents, the stuttering idiot Witwicky kid, the jive talking robots, and the goofball super secret ex-agent to death already. How about having grown adults who are fighting for the planet's survival actually act like it?
__label__1	Don't buy this movie: I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5.
__label__1	Laughable - Not for Kids: As usual in this series, the writing was a joke. The effects were spectacular, but I winced several times at the cheesy dialogue and woeful exposition. The animated move from the 80's is a much better story. I'd heard that this installment was much better than the first two, but I was just as dissapointed. I also thought we might have less women walking around looking like expensive call girls with Megan Fox's exit, but there was even more gratuitous butt and boob exposure than in the others. I should have known better than to waste my 4 dollars and 2 and a half hours. Don't let your kids watch this!
__label__1	Not a good movie. Not for children.: Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.
__label__2	movies on time: The movies get to me the same day they hit the stores and I dont have to drive to get them.
__label__1	No Special Features: First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!
__label__1	Horrible.: The weakest link of the Transformer trilogy; The first two were decent films, how did this one end up so bad? I barely made it through the theatrical viewing, I couldnt imagine buying it and watching it again.
__label__1	Horrible film: Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray.
__label__1	Far too long and too formulaic: Oh please... this movie doesn't tell a story so much as show off special effects and replay platitudes. Should've left well-enough alnoe instead of making this far-too-long sequel.
__label__1	Terrible movie with good special effects: The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time.
__label__1	Science Fiction Pushed To The Limit!: I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real.
__label__1	Digital Copy Doesn't Work: Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.
__label__1	Ok dvd/blu-ray but digital copy will NOT work. Codes are expired!: I specifically got this version of the movie for my husband so he could have the movie on his iphone. The code expired in September and they are still selling it to people as dvd+blu-ray+digital copy. But you cannot get the digital copy because of the expired code. If you wanted the file for itunes like we did, DO NOT BUY!!!
__label__1	The worst of the trilogy!: This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's. It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen. I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment. Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series. I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film. I was very disappointed! As hard as that is to say. It was really bad.
__label__2	perfect: The whole transaction went smoothly. Arrived within reasonable amount of time however have not had the time to watch the movie yet!
__label__1	Want Megan Fox back!!!!!!!: I liked and enjoyed the effects but that's about everything entertaining about this movie. The quality (blue ray on ps3) is pretty bad ass.Story line is very mediocre and no depth at all. The acting was sad at times.And most importantly I missed Megan Fox, someting just wasn't right with the new big upper lip girl. Maybe with Megan it would have been a better movie? Guess we will never know.
__label__1	Terrible movie..: They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it.
__label__2	a great movie: I really liked the movie and i really hope this is the Last Transformers movie.I am only giving it 5 stars for the movie and not the price.I think that is to much for just one dvd which is not a blue ray copy.This price should go down to at least $15.00yeah new movie but price for this nope.Transformers will be always cool, to me at least the three movies did come out good,I would wish they stop making movies from cartoons, Leave the cartoons alone.5 stars for the movie not the priceAlso in the movie, new actors, and new leading lady she was good,His parents had small parts which is good because in this movie they showed him more of a grown man.The scenes from the movies are cool, shot in Chicago and that is a cool city,Alos make you think of the cover ups that really did or did not happen on the moon, or why we went into space.So if you already have the other two movies get this third movie but try to find a lower price
__label__2	What is the Region of this Bluray?: HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn't say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says... Multiregion.
__label__1	Not worth the 3 month wait: 3D is all about pop outs gimmicks which is all missing here there is depth but average not that great. The movie & audio both are great but everybody was anticipating one of the best 3d blurays which is not the case. There are many other movies like Resident evil Final destination 4 & 5 and many others which have awesome 3d effects. If you have already bought the 2d version do not regret.
__label__1	garbage: Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity.
__label__1	If you have already watched trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free.: If you watch trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free. I consider this movie is just below the episode 2 and the 2 below 1. And nothing is new.
__label__2	Transformers: This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. The digital disk was not included, from the package and from your advertising it was suppose to be included. What happened?
__label__1	Same as all the others, dull.: Same as all the other recent transformers movies, dull and bland, completely emotionless. The story lacks excitement, and only the occasionally good special effects made me sit through it.
__label__1	not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes: The DVD is not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes, then the picture becomes stopping and going and keeps that way.
__label__2	"Format Error: DTS Surround Sound NOT on Disc: FYI: As of November 28th 2012, the Product Details for ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2011)"" contains the wrong Format - this Blu-ray disc does NOT have DTS Surround Sound. You can see for yourself when you zoom in on the back cover photo. I've already submitted an ""Update Product Info"" request, and will keep the movie because I bought it on a great Black Friday promotion, but I just wanted to let others know in case it influences their purchase."
__label__1	Digital Copy expired: Annoying when you buy a movie mostly because of the digital copy and it has expired months before.This is a major DISAPPOINTMENT!!
__label__1	New Product, no bonuses: No special features at all, on either disc, just the movie. Not at all what I expected from a Blu Ray/DVD combo pack.
__label__1	Fun cheesy movie but not on prime instant video!!: Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie.
__label__1	"Just a bad movie: Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time."
__label__1	I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck: Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this.
__label__1	Story too boring: The story is so boring. I still have not finished yet after three nights watching: I only take it for half hour.
__label__1	"THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE!: My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:""We hated it. We were bored out my minds, and couldn't understand the story line at all. The acting was moderate. The only good thing about this movie was that it made us super hungry, since it was 3 hours long!..... At least smear a little spot of dirt on ""angel's"" face by the end.""""So basically, don't watch it.""""Sorry, people. We are very frustrated right now."""
__label__2	"A simple question......: I have a question for the continuity people.....I liked the rest of the movie, but was upset to see one thing.....why is ""Eagle's"" ascent stage still on the moon when the autobots go to visit the wreckage? I mean, come on, guys....any 60's space buff would have noticed that error...."
__label__2	Excellent movie at an excellent price!: Got this at a great deal and loved the movie. It's nice that I can watch it on my iTouch anytime and not on Flixster under restrictions.
__label__2	3d version info: Both the French and German Amazon site have the 3d Blu-Ray edition to be release in February 2012 , One has the 9th, the other has the 15th.
__label__2	potty mouth: great movie, but too much sweraing in it!great action screanes, are they giong to bring back megatron as galvatron we should also see unicron
__label__1	"Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst: I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments."
__label__1	Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay.
__label__1	Can't believe I gave this 2 stars: I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience.
__label__2	"Awesome: This Blue-ray has great picture and sound, plays awesome on my 46"" LED LCD. I couldn't ask for anything more."
__label__2	Good series ender: This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot's of action. New girl, cuter than Megan possibly.
__label__2	Good, not great 3D, but still a great movie for action: I already had the DVD version and wanted to see it in 3D. There are a few scenes where things pop out at you, but the overall depth of the video was less than what I was expecting. I'm still glad I purchased it in 3D and have watched it twice since owning it. I watched it on a LG Plasma with active 3D glasses.
__label__2	be trandformed: 3rd Transformer movie brilliant in 3D. The images and colours on blu ray show the movie to its full effeect. Sound on dolby digital perfect. Worth buying for a fun packed couple of hours.
__label__2	a great action movie: Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. However, it does have the worst story compare with the previous two movies. I praised transformers for its phenomenal graphics and computer graphics. It would definitely worth it if anyone is a fan of highly-advance sci-fiction movies.
__label__2	Transformers 3D: The movie was all we expected, and the 3d was just that much better. definitly worth the money. I was very pleased with my purchase.
__label__1	Where the hell is the 3D? Hollywood jerks: I bought a 3D TV only to find out that the selection of 3D Blu-rays absolutely sucks. Half of them are kids movies but the 3D warning says kids aren't supposed to watch 3D movies. No wonder so many people think 3D is a gimmick.The only great things about 3D so far, are some of the PS3 games.my fav right now is God Of War: Origins collectionI want in 3D now!Kung fu panda 2transformers: dark of the moonavatar - available to the public at reasonable price instead of one-hundred-sixty bucks(what a crock, can't believe such a good director sold his soul to panasonic)Wake up, hollywood.Between the economy and the lack of 3D content, I think America's going to hell. They've got their heads too far up their asses and low IQs too. The only thing America is #1 at is creating weapons of mass destruction
__label__1	Rent for the kids, but DON'T buy it.: Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache.
__label__1	Wort. Movie. Ever.: Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me.
__label__1	Definitely not a recommanded to buy:: This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features.
__label__1	"no 3D version: I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
__label__1	This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is.: A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance.
__label__1	I Was fooled again: After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me.
__label__1	Quality: The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up.
__label__2	Transformers: Dark of the Moon DVD: I purchased 2 of this item as Christmas gifts for 2 of my grandsons. They have both watched it more than once and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not have any problems with my order. It was received in a timely manner, and in the condition promised.
__label__2	Must watch: Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it.
__label__1	Makes a great drinking game!: Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess...
__label__1	Transformers - AGAIN?: This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. This movie is really bad. Even with some new blood (or should I say blonde) I couldn't hardly stand to finish the whole thing. But I did. What a waste.
__label__1	"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad!: if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
__label__1	Bad Bad Bad: I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever.
__label__1	Cheap, double dipping scumbags: While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included. NONE!!!!! Nothing!!!! I put it right back on the shelf. I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release! The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle! Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating! If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!
__label__1	Very Disappointing, No Special Features: There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place. Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price. More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying.
__label__2	Transformers 3: The delivery was prompt. The movie is an excellent source of entertainment. Action packed. I hope they make another one in a few years.
__label__1	Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had.
__label__2	Autoawesome!: Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection.
__label__1	Terrible: This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.
__label__1	"I gave up after 57 minutes: Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to read a book instead (""Swimming Home"" by Deborah Levy).I'm glad I did not pay to go see this, I would have fallen asleep."
__label__1	awful: This is by far the worst Transformers movie that I have ever seen. I am glad I did not see this movie in the theaters nor bought this stupid movie. The scenes are so discombobulated and do not flow well together at all. The only one thing that could have deemed this movie is absent namely: Megan Fox vs. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. I keep watching this movie hoping it will get better but so far it is still awful. No more Michael Bay Transformer movies. I think the only way to redeem the Transformer name is to return to an animated movie. I recommend everyone to watch the animated Transformer movie and the original tv series released in the 80's.
__label__2	Best movie out the the three: Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos. And the movie in 3D is awesome, I just bought a LG 47LW6500 and a 3D BD player...what else can I say
__label__2	love it: I ordered this movie from Amazon in good condition. If I need any movies I will order from Amazon again.
__label__2	Darkness rented from Amazon.com: Excellent video, true to the Autobot story. I missed Megan Fox but her replacement was a great Actress and easy on the eyes! I hope the series doesn't loose steam and die!
__label__2	Great Movie: The vendor mailed the movie quickly and it was new and the movie was great. Will order other movies from vendor.
__label__2	It was great!: Forget what the naysayers reviewed. It brought me back to my childhood. I thought it had a good enough plot. Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago. Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek. And what were you expecting Shindler's List? L.A. Confidential? The first time you saw Sixth Sense? It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it.
__label__2	Best one so far!: This is one badass movie. The cgi is spectacular. The 3d is not that great, but the action is crazy, it never stops. Cant wait for Transformers 4. Keep up the great work!
__label__2	This is the version you want!: Not just because of the 3D, but because this is the version where they made an effort to optimize the picture! They released this on blu ray like like avatar was released. First they release the movie without any optimization and special features. Which means the picture looks better than DVD but not the best that blu ray can be.(which means a grainy looking picture that looks like the characters are in a sandstorm and there is a lack of detail that you expect in a blu ray). The they make the limited edition which is made the way a blu ray is supposed to be down. So if you are wondering which one to choose, this is the one you want! All the features with the visuals to boot!
__label__2	Epic: I love this movie and I love this franchise. Each movie keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the got rid of Meaghan's Fox.
__label__1	It's ok...: Not much of a plot differance from the 2nd one... I saw them film in Chicago in 2010... That was the only cool thing about this movie, the Chicago back drop... Other then that don't buy this unless you saw it and liked it.. If you haven't seen it just rent it!!!!!
__label__2	good: I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen.
__label__1	Great Visuals / Terrible Script: Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. Good effects, terrible plot.It was such a departure from the first two. I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets.
__label__1	One bad movie: Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.
__label__1	Really Really Bad!: This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!
__label__1	Horrible: It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.
__label__1	"Yawn: 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
__label__2	Fun movie: In past Transformers movies, I couldn't make out the autobots vs decepticons in the battle scenes, but this one seemed to do the job a lot better.
__label__2	Great Movie: I wouldn't have purchased this movie if I didn't like it, so obviously its a great movie. Hardly even miss Megan Fox. Great special effects, great action, funny.
__label__2	Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Great entertainment. The 3rd Tranformers is not as good as the first, but MUCH better than the 2nd. My family enjoyed very much. Equally action-packed.
__label__1	cool robots bad acting sloppy story: The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go. While LaBeouf and Turturro act as if this movie is their character's last episode --- and they really over-act in this movie which is lacks the charm of the original TV cartoon.
__label__1	horrible: i want the 150 minutes of my life back. this is my first probably last movie review. this move was so bad it motivated me to take the time to do my fair share of trashing it a bit
__label__1	Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Not suitable for my four year old to watch.
__label__1	Terrible plot, interesting effects.: I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it.
__label__1	"One of the Worst Works of Mankind: If you've been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. If you haven't been wondering, I would like to take this opportunity to pose an ironic question, ""What is it like to be mindless?"""
__label__1	"Wow this is bad!: If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time."
__label__1	Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!: This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.
__label__1	Movie was great!. If the movie was actually in the case!!!!: I had placed a huge order for my children for christmas. I was so upset when my children got the movie and there was no disc at all. so my bad review is with the company not with Amazon since they were kind enough to fix this problem and send another movie free of charge and free of shipping!! Thak you!
__label__2	Best Trans yet: This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline.
__label__1	Too Chaotic: Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only.
__label__1	More of the same bad script writing: They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.
__label__1	Well no.: Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok.
__label__1	Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot: I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies.
__label__1	Dark Day On The Moon: I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES.
__label__2	Great Movie: Great movie, however DVD does not have any features. I am not sure if it worth to pay for the price, maybe wait till you can get it on sale.
__label__1	Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut: I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?
__label__2	Dark Side of the Moon: I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can! Special effects are amazing, however the story line is weak compared to the first two movies. I was a little disappointed by the story and this is my least favorite installment. Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete.
__label__2	Great Movie!!: I could watch this movie over and over and over again. The graphics were totally awesome. A must see for all.
__label__2	Graphics and Shia: Definitely is a trilogy. BUT guys its superb in its delivery graphically and Shia is just simply a good actor. More diverse roles he needs, yet ifthe movie was to be watched without biasses or even the knowledge-base of the past two movies the movie would rate 4 stars.Needs more distinguished and 'heavier' plot... so not 5 stars ie as an individual film).I'm being honest on the specific film here. In reference to its repetition of sequences andthe plot generality, the 'trilogy' per say is well ... a more critical discussion.Sticking with the one movie in crit! d
__label__1	it works....i guess: This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea.
__label__1	Good prints... bad compatibility: I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer.
__label__1	bad usb connection on P1000: I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again...
__label__2	Great Photos: This printer will do everything that you would want from a low cost high output machine. The HP 1000 is the best in the photo series and I would recomend this printer to all my friends.Try it, you will like it, like all HP products.
__label__2	When you need a safety pin...: We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose.
__label__2	Yep, they are safety pins: How do you review pins? They arrived as shown. They pinned my bedskirt to the box springs. I have no complaints/
__label__1	Cheap metal: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant.
__label__2	My favorite!!: I collect Jim Shore cats, and I have to say that this one is just amazing. The colors are so beautiful. The figurine is also quite large. Such a great purchase! Buy it, you won't regret it!!!
__label__2	Great backpack and a great value!: My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon.
__label__1	Retarded: This is essentially a live action G.I. Joe film for people with IQ's below 85. I walked out after about 5-10 minutes. I changed the ticket over to Jackass 2 and laughed harder than I have in years during a movie.
__label__2	Best movie ever!!: This movie kicks a** all the way and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's an excellent movie!
__label__1	Just a wanna be Rambo: If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it.
__label__1	"An insult to marines: As soon as this movie started and I saw ""WWE"" on my TV screen I said ""This is gonna suck."" And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie cliché and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk."
__label__1	Maybe 2 1/2 stars.: For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not.
__label__2	The great Robert Patrick: It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence.
__label__1	Even Robert Patrick couldn't save it: I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark.
__label__1	Anyone Who Gave This More Than 3 Stars...: ...is a lie and the truth isn't in them!!This movie was awful. From begining to end. Even the title didn't match. Marine? He was a Marine for all of 5 minutes of the movie!! LOL. But that isn't the worse part.The acting was terrible. Even the good actors (Robert Patrick) played terrible roles. The plot was unbelieveable, the action was unbelieveable, and the comedy was corny. I think the problem was the script itself, but I think GOOD ACTING could have pulled it off.As always I encourage people to see it, but don't spend your money on it. It's garbage.
__label__1	The Few, The Proud, The Marines: Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenes,stuff blowing up, people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners, it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip, have a good time together, but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys. Anyway it's an okay movie to watch when there's nothing on the teliMY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5
__label__1	unvoluntarily ridiculous: Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years.
__label__1	"I know John!! Son went to High School with him!!: I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!"
__label__1	:0( BOOO!: first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort.
__label__1	Action: Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own.
__label__1	this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!: this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Laughably stupid: I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie
__label__1	One of the worst movies ever: Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good
__label__1	what a waste: john cena has to be the worst actor in history, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. not only is john cena annoying his acting is unbearable, its worse then wacthing george bush's innauguration...dont buy it, your waisting your money, its a joke, i honestly dont get how someone could watch him unless ypu think he attractive, which unless you like people who act what their not, then he's ur type john cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling
__label__2	We loved it!: My family watched the movie and loved it. It was exactly what we were looking for.....John Cena action flick to escape reality for a little while. Can't wait til his new movie comes out in March.
__label__1	Typical action film with strange attempt at humor: This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous.
__label__1	Mildly entertaining at best: This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch.
__label__1	"Ha-Ha-Ha...: If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
__label__1	Don't waist your money on this: This movie was a joke, a bad actor, and a bad story, makes it look like the Marine Corp gung ho killers.
__label__2	lots of action~caution on the language: This movie has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. I do, however, warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch, and the language even made me want to leave the room, but if your okay with that, the movie is very action-packed.
__label__2	For hard core action fans.: This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author
__label__1	Marine Comedy: This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh.
__label__1	If bogus got stars, this would have 10: As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. He can afford a nice house and a new Lincoln Navigator on peon pay. He chases his wifes kidnappers thru a construction zone at 100 MPH, endangering everybody instead of just laying back and using the radio to tell the cops where to put a roadblock. He gets hit in the head with enough stuff to start a junkyard but never shows a mark, gets blown up at least twice without being even singed. The HiPo Camaro takes dozens of hits but they all miss the radiator, tires, electrical and fuel system. Not for anybody older than 10. It did have nice explosions, though.
__label__1	"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""?: This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
__label__2	"Non-stop action from beginning to end!: I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
__label__2	"Not a bad movie: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the ""later 80's action film ara"" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no ""Condemed"" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars"
__label__1	Painful to watch...: I watched this movie for some sign of a redeeming quality; and found none. The acting was terrible, the action scenes were dramatically staged and unrealistic, no plot, and they didn't even try to make it humorous. If you watch the special features, they beat the living daylights out of the main character who got injured numerous times during the creation. I felt bad for him because he was really trying. If they had a halfway decent director or photographer, they could have used this guy's effort and hard work to make a good movie. If you want to watch a good B action movie, rent Equilibrium or Dark City. Skip this one.
__label__1	"Bad...: ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."
__label__1	"made me ashamed to have served: This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing."
__label__2	Awesome: I only went to this see this movie because i love john cena and hes sooo HOT. I dont like action movies AT ALL and my husband has to beg me to watch them. But this movie was incredibly awesome. It had me on the seat of my chair from beginning to end. Excellent job john triton.
__label__1	"MAKES THE RAMBO SEQUELS SEEM LIKE CITIZEN KANE!: I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!"
__label__1	"The missing songs...: Nero from NYC - you're absolutely right: unfortunately the best songs of the film are not included on this soundtrack. These are 'Hell', 'Sailors' and 'Whore' performed by the wonderfully strange band ""The Tiger Lillies"" from London, all available on their own CDs... Not really Zydeco, but great stuff, nevertheless!"
__label__1	"Great score, terrible quality: The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album)."
__label__2	Nice: This CD is the epitome of good soundtrack music. You'll get a variety of good music in this album. Definitely recommended.
__label__1	"Where is the music from the film that I bought this cd for?: I enjoyed the film and purchased the cd in search of the Zydeco song ""Your going to Hell"" but alas although it was the most pumping song in the whole film they left it off the sound track! Does anyone know the name of the song that I'm talking about and where can I find it?"
__label__1	"Not satisfied with this item!: We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again."
__label__1	"Disappointing on several levels: There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are ""blurry"" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style."
__label__1	heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs: Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects.
__label__2	Dorothy TumbiUmbi: When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon.
__label__2	One of the Most Romantic Stores Ever!: It's a love story, and it has everything: bandits, highwaymen, corrupt judges, criminal masterminds, heroes, villains, faithful friends, lovers, betrayals, robbery, murder, mines, runaway carriages, and beer for breakfast. It's written in classic 19th-century prose style, so don't be put off by the slow start. Slog through it, tough it out, fall it love with the great John Ridd and the beautiful robber's child, Lorna Doone. Set in Exmoor, it's based on historical events. The Ridd farmhouse exists to this day. Lorna Doone is a must read for everyone, at least once in a lifetime.
__label__2	Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!
__label__2	Lorna Doone: I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it
__label__2	An all-time favorite.: I first read this book when I was a child. It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time.
__label__1	Driver Support: No Mac support. Boooo Hissss!No Win95 support? GOOD! Why are you still running that outdated OS anyway? At least upgrade to Win98.
__label__1	"Problems installing software, weak tech support.: When I run the software installation, it loads it's two executable files into my startup directory. This shouldn't happen.When I try to launch the emarker software, it says ""Cannot initialize encryption, Application shutting down"".I e-mailed their tech support for some ideas and the responder said they didn't think the software would work with Win98SE. ?????"
__label__1	Venus Fly Trap: I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices. They are simple to install and fairly simple to use. In essence, you put it on your keychain, and anytime you hear a song you like (and perhaps want to buy), you hit the button. Then, you attach it to your computer via the cradle, log on to Sony's eMarker website, and by selecting your city and station (you must remember what station you were listening to when you hit the button), it checks the time stored in the unit against the playlist supplied to the Sony website from each radio station. You can get some info on the song/artist, hear some clips, and if you're so-inclined, you can buy the complete song from Sony via download. This is a 'free service', unless you decide to buy the music. In that sense, the eMarker is a clever tool for Sony to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the other means of internet distribution now available, as well as circumventing the retailer.
__label__1	Do not buy: Save your money. It's pure hype. If you listen to more than one station, you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked. If you listen to anything but pop, it's useless. It's just a gadget to get you to buy CD's through their web site.
__label__1	"New Technology Needs Help: The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
__label__1	Worthless Gadget: Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!
__label__1	The $20 stop watch: Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it.
__label__1	It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you
__label__1	Useless!!: I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support.
__label__1	Perfect Idea but just not ready: The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product.
__label__1	emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001: Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team
__label__1	Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!: I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!
__label__1	Good idea, needs LOTS of work: The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point.
__label__1	ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT: Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest.
__label__1	"Not Needed -- Free Alterative: This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
__label__1	Small Device... Huge Disappointment: When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?
__label__1	Not so hot...: I thought this product would be great, and help out my kids a lot!! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing. We can't find a lot of just regular songs. It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself.
__label__1	Incomplete: Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth.
__label__1	waste of cash: This was the biggest waste of money ever created. If you want to know the song that much, call the station and ask them, they don't mind, really.
__label__2	great BUT: great product BUT some guy was working and going to call it the iMusic or something to work on Mac & PC but no stupid sony bought it from him now they get the money for HIS credit and its PC only I HATE THAT STUPID SONY SO NOW I NEED TO USE VIRTUAL PC! THANKS A LOT SONY,or should I say PHONY! (yes i know caps means souting)
__label__1	THE WORST THING EVER CREATED: I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!
__label__2	New Technology!: This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment.
__label__2	This thing rocks!: I got this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. I am not so sure what all the bad reviews are about. All I know is that the E-marker worked perfectly for me and I use it all the time. I live in Boston and the songs are very accurate. Sometimes it takes them a day or so to figure out the song (reason for 1 less star) if the song is an 80's song.
__label__1	"Don't do it! It's still in beta...: Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
__label__1	Great idea...bad support: I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.
__label__1	rip off: no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
__label__1	no more service: eMarker service will be end by the end of September.Refund service has already started.I just got the device last month and am ready to refund now.
__label__1	"SLOW very very slow: Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
__label__2	Good product, but not really needed by younger people: This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation.
__label__1	Discontinued by SONY: eMarker has been discontinued by Sony, here's the noticeThis is to inform you that we will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01. You will not be able to access your eMarker.com account after 9/30/01. If you have eMarks that you would like to save, simply print the screens from your eMarks pages. You will only be able to save hard copies of your eMarks information.
__label__1	Xenote itag was far better: Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. iTag was working and has far more station, it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work. They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly. It's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony.
__label__1	As already stated, a good idea with a lousy execution: I often listen to the radio and don't know what songs are called so I could download em. I saw an advertisement for this product, and decided to try it out. Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks. For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up. I deleted them, but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker. I was very dissapointed in this product, espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it.
__label__1	CAREFUL! SONY rips you off!: I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-(
__label__1	Does what it says, BUT. . .: This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :(
__label__1	eMarker shutting down 30th September 2001: Check their web site at www.emarker.com. A pity. This looked like a good idea. :-(
__label__1	It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you
__label__1	Terrible: I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK.
__label__1	Challenging: This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have.
__label__2	Sony EMarker: A great way to find new music.: I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer.
__label__1	Out of Business: These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer.
__label__1	WASTE: its unbelievable to me that you still have this available to purchase. After 9/30/01, you cannot use this, so why is it on sale still? and why is it going off the market? Its a great idea, I hope someone else picks up where sony leaves off.
__label__2	I love my Sony e-marker!: You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!
__label__2	Works on country and western stations too!: I am a country and western fan in Memphis. This new Sony product is great! I meam really great. I don't have to remember songs I hear on the radio anymore. Definitely worth the $19.99 I paid. Get one!
__label__1	Ruined by neutering the artwork: I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book.
__label__1	Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood: Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame.
__label__1	80's and 90's children will be heartbroken...this has been completely ruined by new artwork...bring the old stuff back!: Half, maybe a bit more than half, of the fun and uniqueness of this wonderful collection was the awesome terrifying artwork...If it still had the old artwork I would definitely buy this for my future children...but alas, it has been replaced by generic boring illustrations similar to every other book...I am 20 now, but these amazing stories along with the scary artwork will always be in my memory and I remember them very fondly. they did not scar my memory or scare me to insanity. They sure were scary but not enough to completely get rid of them! I will never buy this version. I'd rather pay for a used copy of the older better version but never this one...I am kind of heartbroken they got rid of it as it was so perfect the way it was. The parents who complained about the old artwork should be ashamed.
__label__1	No original illustrations = garbage: This is just abysmal... Taking what was THE definitive horror trilogy for the 90s and changing the artwork because tightwad parents disapproved. Don't let your kids read the books if you don't like them, but ruining it for EVERY kid born after 2000? What a sign of the times... Family Guy/American Dad in the Simpsons spot, Twilight saga in the X-Files spot, Hunger Games sweeping Battle Royale under the rug, and now this...
__label__2	"holy crap.: This book was so incredibly scary. It could've been just me being scared easily, but they should change the name of tis book to ""Stories to Scare th Crap out of Kids""Seriously."
__label__1	These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!!: I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity.
__label__1	A watered down version of the original: I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book.
__label__1	Worthless Edition.: Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools.
__label__1	Missing what made the original versions great: The art!: Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals.
__label__1	"Not the original illustrations!: Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
__label__1	Buy the Original Version: This version does not include the gruesome illustrations of the original that still haunt me every once in a while. The book has been controversial because of the uncensored gore and terrifying images. This version is compromised fluffy camping-trip stories.
__label__1	Also displeased with the new art.: As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase...
__label__1	NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST!: Because I remember loving and being absolutely terrified at these books when I was a kid, I recently purchased all 3 and just received them today. To my horror (and not in a good way) I found that they've published them with a DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATOR! With all due respect to Mr. Helmquist (the new guy) and certainly to Mr. Schwartz (the original author), these books were made for me by the art of Stephen Gammell. I'm sure they did this because so many parents tried to get the books banned in their day because of the ghastly drawings, but this is really a tragedy. I would suggest looking elsewhere for original copies of the books as they should be seen. Don't buy them here - you'll be missing out on part of what made these books so wonderful in the first place.
__label__2	scary: This book was great.It was scary at some points, but other times it was a little dull.They also had a wide variety of stories like the first one.They also had many new topics.If you thought the first one had scary stories ,then you should read this one.
__label__2	Childhood favorite, rediscovered: When I learned that they were redoing these books with new, tamed down illustrations (Google it and prepare to be saddened), I remembered how much I loved these, as a kid, a teen, and still today. I knew I had a 3 book box set somewhere, but after not being able to find it, I decided to find replacements online. After ordering, I discovered my old set, but having 2 lets me loan them out to others. These are the most fantastic horror story books for all ages, and the illustrations are truly unsettling. Prepare to be creeped out in the best way possible!
__label__2	Scary stories you'll remember for years: Horrifying and haunting short stories illustrated with mentally disturbing sketches. I used to pull this book out at slumber parties and we'd all freak ourselves out. I still remember some of the short stories to this day.
__label__2	The best book to scare you and your friends: This book is the best book ive read in my entire life. I love the book because it has scary,funny short stories that will scare you and your friends. And the good thing about it is that it is an enjoyable book not a long boring one about one thing only. And it has really cool pictures with the story so you can know what is happening.It is easy to read and to understand the stories.
__label__1	Be Cautious with Young Children: This may be an awesome book for children who are not too sensitve and love to be scared. However, for the more senitive child, it can be very disturbing. A teacher read some of the stories to my 4th grader's class months ago and he is still having trouble sleeping. The pictures are what has bothered him the most. He can't seem to get them off his mind. So, be selective about with whom you share this book. You may have some unhappy parents if you choose to read it to a group.
__label__1	new art is garbage: This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away. I dont have my old copies any more and now the old books are going for outrageous sums. I wanted to get these books for my kids someday--not any more.
__label__1	"The art is a joke: This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
__label__1	Scary Stories that are no longer scary.: The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel.
__label__1	These are not the books you grew up with...: Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself.
__label__1	Illustrations are Terrible!: First off, I must say that I used to read these books when I was younger (even though I'm still a kid). And the stories in this book are the original great stories, but the ILLUSTRATIONS the best part of the original version, have been CHANGED. That really sucks because the new pictures are so watered down they aren't scary anymore. The new title should be Not Scary Stories to Tell in the dark.
__label__1	Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?
__label__1	Another person who can't believe they changed the art.: Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake.
__label__1	Do Not Buy This Edition: Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special.
__label__2	"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""!: A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""! Unlike that book, these stories are original (and not sad).My favorite story is ""The Hook"", because I enjoy scary stories about serial killers, and this one, like ""High Beams"", can happen, which makes it HORRIFYING!"
__label__2	"NIGHTMARES: YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
__label__1	Jake's: I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book.
__label__1	Scary when I was little, not years later.: I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then.
__label__1	"Horrified, and not in a good way: To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."
__label__1	Warning for customers: Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition.
__label__1	"This was just a mistake.: Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
__label__1	Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations: I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them.
__label__1	Not the book from your childhood.: Stephen Gammell's amazing and terrifying art --the most memorable part of this series-- has been stripped and replaced with generic art by Brett Helquist in this edition.
__label__1	Bring back Gammell: The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary.
__label__1	My Childhood! :(: While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else. The new artwork is generic Harry Potter-esque and has none of the unadulterated creepiness the original one had. Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were.
__label__1	Not the Best Version: While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's. But that is the point! Gammell's work is more effective, it is REAL art, not merely illustration.For the sake of your children's AESTHETIC development, do the right thing!
__label__2	After 13 years, I still can't look in the mirror at night: My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. This set of books is unbelieveable in the sense that Schwartz's storytelling knows exactly how to get to you. I'm a senior in college, and yet I still remember quite vividly reading the stories and being afraid to go near the back of our yard because it backed up to a field. In book two (I believe) the story of the thing in the mirror STILL gives me chills at night (my dorm room has a full-length mirror in it, and I hang my robe over it at night!)And, of course, my father knew just what to do to make me really remember the stories...like sneaking up behind me when I was feeding our rabbits at night at the back of the yard (next to the field, of course)I would highly recommend this collection of stories to anyone who is young at heart, or just wants to scare the pants off of their child (or sibling). The memories are well worth the cost of the books!
__label__2	You Think the books are Creepy? Listen to the cassettes!: I remember reading these as a kid and then buying all of them a few years later. The stories were great the illustrations were creepy, and like a lot of reviews, my little brother was scared of that picture in the haunted house story. well, ok it was pretty darn ugly. This is one of those books that still gives me the chills especially fro mthose pictures? oh what a warped mind that artist had but what creative drawings they are!Now, if you think the books are scary, try listening to the cassettes. i am in my twenties and the voice of the narrator and that creepy music gives me the willies. try listening to it in a room by yourself, and see how long it takes you to run for the door! The Scary Stories and More Scary Stories cassetes (i am not kidding) it is a kid's tape and that music will creep you out. listen to it! pick up the book follow along and see how long you last!
__label__1	LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!
__label__1	Buy the original.: I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed.
__label__1	Replacing Gammell's art is a mistake!: This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children. After over 3 decades, it would be so sad to see Gammell's version just disappear...
__label__1	Disaster: The new illustrations are a complete disaster. The stories in Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark are fine. What made the book great were the illustrations. These new ones are a disaster and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.
__label__1	Gammell Made this Series Great: With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich.
__label__1	Artistically censored, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION!: While walking through Barnes and Noble after Christmas, I was wondering how to spend my gift card. By chance, I decided to travel down memory lane and pick up the boxed set of my favorite scary story collections as a child. Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique! For whatever spineless reason, the publisher decided to replace the original ghastly pictures with tame and watered-down versions. Sure, the stories are the same...but the artwork just doesn't fit. It is blasphemy to mess with such perfection. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VERSION BY PURCHASING IT! Instead, hunt down the originals and buy them. You will be glad you did!
__label__2	Great for story telling: While I do admit that these stories are no longer capable of scaring me, I also understand the fact that...this is a children's book. That being said, if you are not 12 and under, you might find some of the stories rather bland-- especially if you're a serious horror fan.Anyway, this book is great for campfire/sleepover/Halloween party-type settings. They're pretty short, but still quite enjoyable. My father read these books to my siblings and I as children during the month of October, and they scared the crap out of us.The illustrations....weird, scary, freaky stuff. Bottom line. In my opinion, the pictures are even scarier than the actual stories. I'm 26 now, and some of them still creep me out to this very day. So, if you're intending to read these stories aloud, then make sure that you show the pictures to add to the scare factor.Overall, I still enjoy this collection of stories. I highly suggest giving them a shot.
__label__2	This is an amazing collection of folklore!!!: This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12.
__label__1	"Not what I remembered as a kid...: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
__label__1	Good for younger readers: [Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier.
__label__1	"Disappointed: I was disappointed with this book. I expected ""real"" ghost stories with substance. The book only has short folklore legends."
__label__2	The BEST SCI-FI / Adventure book I have ever read. Great!: Simply put, this book is what other writer strive to achieve. It has a little of everything: Fantasy, Adventure, Exploration, Mythology, Romance, and Scientific Theory of the day. Fascinating exploration of what is really in the unused 90% of the mind.
__label__2	History of Fantasy: Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom.
__label__1	Average Lost Civilization Fantasy: Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com
__label__2	"Course includes audio, but Amazon does not sell that part... yet.: This book is described on how-to-learn-any-language.com as ""the most comprehensive Estonian course available"". Unfortunately Amazon does not offer the 32 audio CDs/tapes that are integral to the course. Eight of the first nine units of audio are available free online at Indiana University. The complete course (text and audio) is available at Audio Forum and Multilingual Books.See you at the Song and Dance Celebration in July 2009!"
__label__1	Racism and Sex: This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this.
__label__1	A disappointment: Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!
__label__1	Bellydance Magical Motion: I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!
__label__1	disappointing: I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own.
__label__1	very simple interpretation of bellydance: I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several.
__label__2	Perfect introductory video: This is a great video for learning basic belly dance technique.I am a professional dancer, and I recommend this video to women who are interested in learning how to belly dance.Atea has a very gentle demeanor, so the tape is not too intimidating for a beginner; she covers the basics well however, so that students who choose to continue with real-life classes have a good foundation to build upon.Atea covers finger cymbal (zil) patterns, slow (taqsim) movements, isolations and shimmies.There is a whole section (5 min. or so) at the end where women dance in different costumes, so that you can see how the moves can be put together.
__label__2	Very helpful: I have been taking Belly Dance lessons for several years. I found this tape very helpful and the instructions clear. I think the intent of the tape is to introduce certain movements and let the viewer be creative. So if you are looking for a full workout you will not get it from the tape. You have to make your own. But that is one of the beauties of the tape. If you want to dance in the privacy of your home or if you are thinking of taking lessons, I think this would be great for you. It is a very gentle tape. Do not be fooled by the 1996 date listed here. That must be the reprint date, my tape said 1985 which explains the dated hair and makeup. Atea is not the most animated speaker but I think that is in line with gentle nature of the tape. I think the tape is very much in the spirit of belly dancing as it encourages the viewer to use her own style.
__label__2	"Belly Dancer from L.A.: Great video for intro to belly dancing and for reinforcing what you already know. I love this video, I also bought their Belly Dance Fast Moves, and Slow Moves, great, great, great, training videos. Also highly reccommend ""The Ancient Art of Oriental Belly Dance"""
__label__1	beginners only, maybe: Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners.
__label__1	These videos are horrible!: I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!
__label__1	It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings: Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it.
__label__1	Scary: I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
__label__1	"There are far better tapes out there...: If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
__label__1	"Frail White Women Wriggle About: While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
__label__1	should have known better: For basic instruction this tape is OK. Her oral description of the techniques is clear. Atea is not relaxed at all in her instructions or moves. In the instruction part of the video she seems like a puppet controlled by strings. She is too skinny, unattractive and doesn't even have an attractive navel. She fails to hold your attention. Her other dancers are a bit better, but the whole tape seems so contrived and does not move with a natural flair. For verbal instruction, OK, for visual efects you can get much better. And the dance at the end is a real joke. Your money is better spent on Suhaila!
__label__1	Not My Favorite: I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking.
__label__2	Excellent introduction, not workout video...: I really got into belly dance workouts about 6 years ago and purchased this video at that time. I remember hating it and thinking that it was the most worthless video I'd seen. After falling off the belly dance wagon, I now lead a group of women who are learning to belly dance using instructional videos. In going through my collection I revisted this video and realised that it would have made a great introduction to the world of belly dance. I plan on teaching a new group next year and will use this video the first night for those who are interested in the history and basic moves. I am so glad that I gave this video another chance.
__label__2	Great Introduction - A classic: This was one of the first Bellydance instructional videos on the market and I believe Atea did not have the in front of the camera experience and production assistance of many of the slicker more current videos/DVDs.Despite Atea's slightly stiff appearance and the somewhat dated aspects of this production, the essential information (and many of the bellydance fashions) are classic and have not changed very much at all. It is a great introduction to the dance, basic moves, history, and costuming.
__label__1	Unreliable: Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail.
__label__1	a trip to unreadable: This attempt at discussing documentary film is fraught with difficulties for the reader. The prose is clumsy, circumstantial and muddled to the point that I found myself reading passages aloud to others for help. Unfortunately none was forthcoming.There is little excuse to buy this book when there are so many good ones such as those by Barnouw and Jacobs which area clear and informative.
__label__1	"Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
__label__1	The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...: Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it.
__label__1	"the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it's so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher's performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher."" In short, you'll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums."
__label__1	buying cd eurovision delux: It would be helpful if you could put what songs are on this cd as I have a few and wouldn't like to duplicate them.

__label__1	The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh: I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less.

__label__2	Fine product: I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly.

My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them."
__label__2	Awesome hiking boot: These are my 1st pair of Hi-Tec boots and I could recommend them to anyone looking for a quality product at a great price.
__label__1	"Not Good Anymore!: I have owned these boots for years. They are very good Quality and very Comfortable. They lasted me winter after winter. In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times. Now for the pair I ordered, not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer. The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove. Assuming they were the same, I purchased a pair from Amazon (which is priced excellent) but they did not fit proper at all. The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something... and are no longer the same. Which is too bad. So as far as Amazon goes... ""flawless as usual"" Returning them was not a problem. Just beware of these boots. Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON, CANADA :)"
__label__2	Excellent for the Price: My ex bought these for me for $70 to get me into hiking here in the Cascades around Seattle (I have always hiked wearing regular shoes, but on flatter terrain in Northern California). I have always worn them with hiking socks and liners and they have been phenomenal. I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down. After two years I can still slosh through creeks and melting snow and I've never gotten wet feet. The boots have held up well and look as though they'll last another year or two of hiking and snowshoeing.
__label__2	buyer of boot: This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness.
__label__2	Great product: Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value.
__label__2	Good Deal On Amazon: I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight.
__label__2	"Seems like a nice pair of boots.: I have only wore these boots a couple of times, so I may be reviewing them too soon. As other reviewers have stated they don't seem to need a break in period, but there is a certain ""learning"" period. I say this as a person who literally has worn nothing but tennis shoes for years. The learning is getting used to the extra weight and bulk on your feet. I bought these to be a part of my ""bug out"" plan. I will soon be going on a real hike on rougher terrain to see how they feel then. Plus until I have put many more mile on them to see how they hold up I can't say for sure how many stars they deserve. I give them 4 for now and assuming 200-300 miles from now they are still in good shape I would change it to 5."
__label__2	Hi-Tec, the best !: Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints.
__label__2	Men's High Tec Boot: This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots.
__label__2	Good Boots: Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again.
__label__2	"Only shoe my husband will wear: Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
__label__2	Very good for the price: This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean.
__label__2	Wonderful: Comfortable right out of the box. Well made. Durable. Can't vouch for the waterproofing of them, as I have learned many moons ago.....no shoes are waterproof. I refuse to test them, once you do...they never seem to be the same.
__label__2	Outstanding boot at a great price: This is the first time I have purchased hiking boots online. I hike a lot. 40+ miles per week generally. I wear out hiking boots in about four months, and am getting tired of driving all over the place trying to find something that fits, and isn't too expensive. These are great! Comfortable right out of the box. Sturdy but still flexible enough to move with your foot. I have only just started with them - but at this price, and with the Amazon Prive fast and free shipping: I will be coming back here for more when I wear the treads off of these in a couple hundred miles.
__label__1	Overhyped?: Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.
__label__1	"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!: They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
__label__1	Poor quality control: I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control.
__label__2	Good enough: I had to return the first pair, each side felt completely different in how they fit.The second pair fit well and are pretty comfortable, I imagine they will be better after break in. They seem well made. I gave four stars because I believe the insoles could be a little better.I bought the black, but after a hike on a dusty trail I realized brown would have made more sense. Oh well.As usual, Amazon was outstanding with it's service. Both orders were received in one day even with two day prime shipping. The return of the first pair couldn't have been easier.
__label__1	These boots are much darker than the picture: Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected.
__label__1	Cheaply made boot: Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!
__label__1	Not comfortable: These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone.
__label__2	good boots: i usally buy these boots from famous footwear and pay like 80 to 90 bucks so i found them on amazon alot cheaper, thanks
__label__2	Great boot for the price: Just got back from a 9 mile hike in the Smoky Mountains. These boots did great. Very comfortable and held up well on the terrain. Highly recommended.
__label__2	good shoes: was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull
__label__2	Happy Feet: These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!
__label__2	as good as advertised: Yes, these boots are comfortable. They soften after a few miles of walking. They keep your feet warm and dry, especially with my smartwool socks. Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere.
__label__2	quality hiking boots in good price!: I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces.
__label__2	Warm & Comfy: These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money.
__label__2	Great boot. Light but rugged.: This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.
__label__2	BEST SHOES EVER: I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT
__label__1	Right Boot Defective: The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole.
__label__2	Great boots for the price: I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s.
__label__2	Great purchase: Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!
__label__2	"A really good pair of shoes: These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version."
__label__2	Hi-tec Hiking Boots: Like them. Very lite and comfortable. Dry. I'm a now-and-then day-hiker and had only worn them once in the woods. There was a problem of soreness under the top, inside gromets on both boots. Got a suggestion of re-stringing the top gromets from my daughter-in-law, and it worked when I wore them all day running around locally. Suggest including some alternative stringing techniques in shoe boxes.
__label__2	What a great boot!: This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair.
__label__2	Great Boots!: Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued.
__label__2	Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot: Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.
__label__2	"Yes, they are waterproof!: My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots."
__label__2	Good backpacking boot - for a while: I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking.
__label__2	"Hi-Tech: This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
__label__2	Great hiking boots: Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs.
__label__2	Very happy: So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.
__label__2	Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking Boot: Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes.
__label__2	reboot: Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots.
__label__2	Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend
__label__2	Excellent boot: This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking.
__label__2	"Excellent Mid-range Boot!: I just now purchased on Amazon my third pair of Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Boots (over the course of 10 years). I live in Minnesota and have found these boots to be excellent in all types of weather, year-around. In addition to wearing these boots every workday on my warehouse job, I do a lot of weekend hiking, camping and exploring of the North Woods and have never been disappointed with these boot's performance. When worn (and sized) for a good pair of extra cushioned wool socks (I buy Smartwool Trekkers Series), these boots are warm enough for shoveling snow and are also comfortable and cool enough for summer wear. It is a perfect light, all around utility boot and I highly recommend them. They are the only boots I have ever literally worn out (they never failed due to workmanship or materials). I just replace the shoestrings with a good quality boot lace and they ""keep on running""!!"
__label__2	Excelentes botas.. excelentes boots: Excelente producto, quedo muy satisfecho con el producto y con Amazon, por la puntualidad en la entrega,la calidad del producto, zapatos muy comodos, resistentes. Excelente muy recomendable.
__label__2	Big Improvement After 30 Years!: I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks.
__label__2	14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE: My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued.
__label__2	Hi-Tec Boots Work for Me: Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!
__label__2	Great Boot: These Hi-Tec Boots are excellent and very good quality.I use them while I am a rural carrier. they are a great work boot.I recomend to all. Peter.
__label__1	not good: 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
__label__1	Cheap Boots: Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.
__label__1	VERY NARROW: This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
__label__2	hiking boot: We bought these for my husband. He has a rough time with shoes of any kind. These needed some time to be broke in but beyond that are very good. Good price - good value for the money, we think.
__label__1	"Horrible: Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
__label__1	Not As durable as i hoped: Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.
__label__2	Good: This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.
__label__2	Boots: I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice.
__label__2	Hi-Tec are the best shoes: This is my second pair. First pair I wore until the soles were paper thin. Still use them about the yard. Second pair was deliverd quick. Fantastic waterproof feature and comfortable. I occasionally spray shoes to keep them in top notch condition. I high recommend these boots. They are perfect also for hikes as I have wore mine on the AT everytime I visit.
__label__2	hi-tec mens altitude IV: great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size.
__label__1	Heavy and Stiff: I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction.
__label__1	not up to her standards: not nearly as good as her usual work if your hoping to hear her forget it it is a pale comparison with authors who don't have her style
__label__1	Is this a junk book?: In the name of science, you will try to prove with propagande;if you really want to decode how junk scientifics manipulate the world: go http://nomorefakenews.com and do not buy this junk BOOK!
__label__1	"I'm great, everyone else stinks: I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy ""The Vintage Mencken"" to read his evisceration of chiropractic."
__label__1	Junk Book :)): If you are a big fan of industry PR campaigns, then this book is for you!However, if you are a critical thinker that is interested in evidence and facts, this book is Junk.Interesting note: The author is affiliated with organizations that are funded by major industries such as 3M, Chevron, Dow Chemical, etc. He is most likely writing what they are paying him to write (e.g. their point of view).
__label__1	"Don't fall for the ""junk science"" scam: Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
__label__1	Shameful: The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues.
__label__1	Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition: I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her).
__label__2	"What a lovely treat!: Quite frankly, I'm suprised that no one has ever done a Kate Bush tribute album. Given her cult following and ecclectic catalogue, and the number of recording artist who cite Kate as a major influence, it's an project that's more than a little overdue. And Tom Dunning rises gloriously to the occasion. Clearly everyone involved in this album considers this a labor of love, and it makes for a delightful listen.Some of my favorite tracks? ""There Goes a Tenner"" is rendered in trippy-hippy-hoppy-happy fashion - clever and fun. ""Hounds of Love"" is just lovely to listen to, perhaps even better than la Kate's version. Those who chose to cover the B-sides have my devotion, as those are among my own personal favorites. And the tracks I didn't love, well, I didn't love 'em to begin with.Simply put, if you're a fan of Kate, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection - and if you're trying to introduce any of your friends to la Kate, this album could only aid you in your cause."
__label__1	"Desperately seeking..Kate: Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
__label__2	An Excellent Look Into What Motivates Students Of Ballet.: This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet.
__label__2	I needed that....: It is a good book for review and modivation. Technique is well explained. Makes a great read for beginner and intermediate fly fisherman.

__label__2	Paxton Quigley is a realist: When women ask me about safety and firearms, this is the first book I recommend to help them on their terms.
__label__1	Maybe good for beginners: Paxton Quigley's book is a compliation of parts of other books on firearms self protection. It's a bit overdone, and probably would scare the average woman thinking about protecting herself. Women seem to have special problems protecting themselves. They usually do not want to hurt anyone, and they will do all most anything for a baby or a family member before they will do anything to protect themselves. However, women that are able to continue to practice with a hand gun, usually become quite proficent. They know that they don't know, and they listen to instructions. Most men think they know it all already.
__label__1	Not Quite A Piano Book: I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read.
__label__2	Great movie: I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD
__label__2	Great Movies: I had last seen this movie when it came out in 1970. The plot, scenery, acting are as good as it gets. John Mills' performance as Michael earned him a well deserved academy award. He had to spend hours every day just on make-up.As time goes by people pass but their art stays with us forever. Most of the actors in Ryans Daughter are long gone. This movie that was initially not a critical favorite has stood the test of time and is in my top ten along with such movies as Kelly's Heroes, The Graduate and so on. Watching it on VHS format didn't diminish a thing.
__label__1	Ryan's Daughter DVD: We were disappointed that this DVD would not play on our regular DVD player. We were able to play it on our computer. There must be something different about the format. Jim Jones
__label__2	"Ryan's Daughter: I loved the movie 40 years ago and I love it just as much now. A recent trip to Ireland made it even more moving. The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip. Much of the dialog about the ""troubles"" in Ireland went over my head when I saw the movie as a young women, hovever they made a real an impression this time. Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly."
__label__2	"One of my favorite movies of all time.: While this movie was not ""highly acclaimed"" when it was released, back in the late 1960's or early 70's ""I think,"" I have always like it and watch it about once every two or three years. It is the kind of movie that you never get ""fully bored with.""On a scale of 1-5 stars, I give it only four (4) stars, since it is one of those movies that many ""action junkies"" would not like; even-though, it actually has quite a bit of ""lower key action"" and beautiful phototgraphy to support it.My bottom line is: ""If you liked Dr. Zhivago then you will, or should, like Ryan's Daughter."""
__label__2	BEAUTIFUL: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS I EVER SAW. VISUALY STUNNING. IF YOUR A FAN OF GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY DO NOT MISS OUT!!!!!!!!! THIS FILM WON THE OSCAR IN THAT CATEGORY FOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN 1970.
__label__2	Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?
__label__2	"When oh when!: Each month I scan the ""new"" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?"
__label__2	"FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTOR: Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list. It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format. As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is."
__label__2	best of david lean: Ryan's Daughter one of the best cinematographic delights of the 20th century. An outstanding international cast provides truly the most marvellous of characters and depth of storyline. A truly emotional rollercoaster for the viewer with seductive influences. Great.
__label__2	Beautiful Epic: I saw this movie when originally released in 1970.It had always left a strong impression upon me.Seeing it 42yrs later,is a real treat.It had created a profound impression upon me in '70 but years later it had softened a bit.The depth and beauty of Ireland is quite evident.Robert Mitchum,is stellar in this role.The story is timeless.
__label__2	Stunning cinematography; gripping story: A very, very long movie that will hold your attention with some of the greatest cinematography, ever, and a well-told story of passion, intrigue, and haunting evocation of what is truth? One of the ten best movies of all time. Extraordinary!
__label__2	ROMANCE SET IN NORTHERN IRELAND: Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)David Lean's very interesting romance set in Northern Ireland in 1916. Robert Mitchum is almost type-cast as the sleepy-eyed and plodding village school - master, who marries young Sarah Miles. Christopher Jones is the British Officer who has an affair with Sarah during his stay in the village. But there are only two real stars of the show - the beautiful, sweeping scenery and John Mills, who won a supporting actor Academy Award, for his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal as the hunch - backed village idiot. Production designer, Stephen Grimes, obviously inspired by David Lean's extravagance, creates an entire village to use as the main set. Trevor Howard and Australian, Leo McKern are also very good in their roles.
__label__1	ryan's daughter: The DVD was fine - it would be useful if you explained about the regions and how you have to change your dvd program to watch the dvd.
__label__2	Good: I originally saw this movie on TV back in the late 1970s. I like the cinematography and of course the acting is superb. However I think the beginning and intermission could have cut out where all you get is about 10-15 minutes of orchestra music with a still picture of Ireland's countryside. Especially at the end of disc 1 where the music goes non-stop and then you realized that the movie continues on disc 2.
__label__2	Compelling and haunting: This should have been a classic. I saw it originally in the 70s and decided recently to rent it...I wanted to know if it had the same appeal.....if anything, it was far more beautiful than memory served. the scenery is spectacular, the acting suberb! They don't make movies like this anymore! Pour yourself a nice glass of wine and settle down to a very entertaining movie.
__label__1	Lean Pickin's: Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless.
__label__1	Irish movie: The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film.
__label__1	customers beware: When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting a good deal because of the cheaper price. However, once I received it, I knew I had made a mistake. I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!
__label__1	Worst quality I've seen in a long time: Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder, but quality is unacceptably poor. The zoom lever is hard to operate, and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise, really making you nervous. LCD screen is a little flaky, deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter. I think I wasted my money, and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job.
__label__1	Samsung 8mm video camera: The on/off switch is stuck. I cannot therefore record or review tapes. I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired.
__label__2	"Great Budget Camcorder: I wanted to record all the new things my 7 month old son is doing. I'm also broke. I need a good camcorder without spending a fortune. I looked into eBay and even used camcorders. When I read all the good reviews about this product, I thought I'll give it a shot.With the first use, our family fell in love with it. For the price, you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is a whole lot better than what I expected. This is my 4th Samsung purchase and everyone so far has been a very positive experience. I wish this camcorder has some ""advanced features"" like USB connectivity so that I can download movie clips to a computer. But then again, I didn't have the extra [money] to spend. In couple years, I plan to buy a digital camcorder but for now this will suffice.Bottom line:For 1st time buyers, this is a good start. It's not the best camcorder but definately a good one. It's worth the money."
__label__2	Good for begginers: I was looking for a good camcorder for beginers. This one is perfect. It is not the best camcorder, but a very good one. I gave it 5 stars because the price is cheaper than it should be.It is worth much more than it is.
__label__1	Not worth it!: This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!
__label__1	Malfunction after short time: The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally .......
__label__1	Awkward controls, below-par reliability: Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers.
__label__2	"This is definitely a ""MUST HAVE"" in your collection...: Two things alone on this album from Jason Robert Brown are all you need to be satisfied with the purchase.1) Track #3- ""Someone to Fall Back On"" is one of my all-time favorites of his. It has such a catchy, but soothing, melody line that can't be passed over.2) Lilias White bustin' it out once again on ""Coming Together"" -- adding a glorious rich sound that fans of her will love to play again and again.Few composers/storytellers can tap in to emotion with such satisfying melodies as this gifted musician. Anything he records will gladly be added to my iTunes b/c I can't get enough. Truly wonderful."
__label__2	You MUST buy everything by Jason Robert Brown!!!: So hello. This is Grant, a performer and music lover. I've followed Jason's music from the big stuff that everyone knows to the little shows like Urban Cowboy in Coconut Grove that not everyone got to see. This CD is a MUST have. Jason's excellence and genius shines through with such variety in this newly released CD. His adaptability is shown best in Parade, and his fantastic ability to write songs for starving singers comes through in The Last Five Years and Songs For A New World, but if you just want a great CD to listen to with fantastic variety and all around genius, this is the CD to get. This would make a great gift for any open music lover. Don't forget to keep up on his new works. He's a busy guy and is often coming out with new original music. Also look out for his new website!
__label__2	"U need this JRB CD!: This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!"
__label__2	Another Aw Inspiring Career Move: Just when you thought JRB couldn't get better he does. The music is greatly appealing to a wide range of listeners. Of course if your a fan you already have it. If you are not familiar there is something for everyone. It isn't the stereotypical musical theatre album. It has a wonderful rock/pop feel with musical theatre sensibility as only JRB can seem to produce.One of my favorites is Over. A tremendous song about a soldier who just died in the desert of some war torn country (just pick one). It is touching, poignant, and somehow even patriotic.So anyway run to get this album because it will be a classic and if you are not into musical theatre it is because you haven't heard it executed like this.
__label__1	OK: I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work.
__label__2	excellent resource: I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.
__label__2	BRIO Curved Track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. Another must have for train extending. We have about 10 sets of these. It makes it really easy for our son to build whatever he wants. Another great product.
__label__2	"really good release of the ORIGINAL 1957 LP!: I think too many people are assuming that they are buying a compilation CD when they pick up this release. In fact, this was the original album released in 1957. Ella gets top billing becuse she was the biggest of the three ""names"" at the time. These sessions were laid down between Jan 4, 1956 and April 30, 1957. Each artist gets a chance to showcase their talents and it is apparent that, when they all get together for the few numbers that they all share, they are really swinging and having a great time. Basie's band was in top form, the arrangements were wonderful and the vocals are spot on. This is a terrific window into the past."
__label__2	"Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams.: What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile."
__label__1	Good print quality - bad mechanism: I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.
__label__1	Lousy: This has to be the most horrible printer in the world. If I could give it -5 stars I would. I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer. Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up. Its print quality is horrible. It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all. They keep saying to install new drivers, when it is clearly a hardware problem. I want to throw this thing away, unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I'm stuck with it. Don't buy this pile of junk.
__label__2	Older Craftsman Garage Door Opener.: I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener.
__label__2	Got 'er fixed: This was one of the most simple and cost saving things I have done. instructions were exact and took longer to put cover back on vs. change the part.
__label__1	Product Performance: RPM sensor was defective. The lift motor would not stop running with the new circuit board installed.I removed the new circuit board and replaced it with the old one and everything seems to be OK now.The part is so inexpensive it's not worth returning.
__label__2	Worked like a charm: My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great.
__label__2	RPM Sensor Assembly: Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast
__label__2	Customer service: The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks
__label__2	Best Computer Acessory: A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well.
__label__2	Fantastic Photo Printer: This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless.
__label__1	Envelope Feeder Never Worked: I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one.
__label__1	My mistake: This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!
__label__1	Poor customer support: The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware.
__label__1	Recipe for grief: Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer.
__label__1	"Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!!: I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
__label__1	Hp Customer Care! A Joke!: On 04/03/02 I bought a new printer hp photosmart 1215, it installed perfectly, now, suddenly it decided to stop dead!I have contacted Hp Customer Care re the problem....timeout settings...no help availadle...also my PC tells me there are now no drivers for this device installed! How can this be???
__label__2	Worth the wait: This album is worth the wait. Great vocals accompanied by rocking fuzzed out riffs. Sounds like the perfect cross between Unida and Kyuss. The cd hasn't left my player yet. The only problem I have (which means 4 stars instead of 5) is that its fairly short. It really only has 7 tracks that total under 30 minutes. That aside, any fan of this genre of music will love it. The cd flat out rocks all the way through.
__label__1	"Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
__label__1	"Can't Believe This Was Even Published: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
__label__2	This player deserves more US air time: I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him.
__label__1	"The ultimate ""touchy-feely"" book.: This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book."
__label__1	"I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....: Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
__label__1	too small to read: My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-(
__label__2	A classic favorite.: Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale.
__label__2	A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!
__label__2	A well earned Caldecott: Puss in boots is always an enjoyable tale, probably because it is so based on wit.I really enjoyed these illustrations they are glowing and friendly, making one feel very comfortable as they turn the pages. Puss is adorable, the expressions that our fine illustrator manages to convey through his feline features are just fantastic! Time and time again I was always dissapointed when I found a page that the lovely cat was not on.A wonderful additition to any collection of books for children or lover of fairy tales.
__label__1	Not what I expected: I purchased this for my granddaughter, we love reading together. The print was WAY to small and no way to make it bigger.
__label__2	Very good price and quality.: This fiber optic (cable) is paired with StarTech.com 10/100 Fiber to Ethernet Media Converter Multi Mode SC 2 km (MCM110SC2)StarTech.com 10/100 Fiber to Ethernet Media Converter Multi Mode SC 2 km (MCM110SC2)and has no loss of signal, once the bends in the run are expanded.
__label__1	Boring: Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness.
__label__2	Deceptively good: Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too).
__label__1	There's nothing in the Airs: The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad.
__label__2	A well written and thought out book on Risk Management: This book provides practical and insightful look at risk management and how it can benefit companies. Reading and understanding this book should be a pre-requisite for any person going to take on management position.
__label__2	A Must Read for Risk Management: This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author¡s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management.
__label__2	Fables from India Well Presented.: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift.
__label__2	Good translation.: This is an eminently readable translation though I still prefer Arthur W. Ryder's translation. I believe Ryder's translation is currently out of print.
__label__2	"Great Update of, and Supplement to, Strunk & White: Similar in style and tone (and usefulness) to Strunk & White's classic ""Elements of Style"". Short, pithy, intelligent. Lots of examples, followed by Professor Lasch's thoughtful, penetrating, often witty comments. Recommended for all undergrads."
__label__2	"Characteristics of Bad Writing: Plain Style was written in 1985 by Christopher Lasch, a history professor who was frustrated with his students' lack of writing ability. There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages."
__label__1	I appreciate what he attempted, but...: I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference.
__label__1	Unable to install: My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space.
__label__2	Decent book for its time.: This book was written in 1923, and I have an original copy I bought online from some book site.It is worth the read, and it has some history to it. (Names, old addresses, etc.) but because of it being in the early 20th century, the information might be outdated.A good classical read on the subject none of the less.
__label__2	A great dance groove.: I haven't as of yet come across another album with such a wonderfully mellow techno-jazz beat. One of the best music purchases I've ever blindly bought. Especially good for those listeners who enjoy a hauntingly beautiful women's voice laced throughout their beats. Cannot reccomend this album strongly enough!!
__label__2	"Summer classic: It's been a good year for Liverpool's The Coral. A mere number of months after their stunning debut comes this, surely one of the singles of the year. ""Pass It On"" is their state of the universe address, a plaintive plea for understanding. It begins a little like The Beatles' ""You Like Me Too Much"" but soon becomes its own thing of beauty. Far more low-key than anything on The Coral, they seem to have dispensed that elemental quirkiness which so defined their earlier work. Frontman James Skelly is the real star of this track, his magnificent vocals squarely front and center. Anticipating their forthcoming Magic & Medicine album, ""Pass It On"" is a summer track for the ages and The Coral have done it again. Was there ever any doubt?"
__label__2	hard to find - but worth it: A progammable thermostat that you can actually set differently for each of the seven days - perfect for people with non traditional schedules. And the 'off the wall' setting capability makes it very convenient to set up.
__label__2	Get rid of cycling: I was sick of the constant cycling my cheap programmable thermostat was doing. It would cycle my furnace and A/C every 5 to 10 minutes regardless if it needed it. This one let's you adjust that cycle temperature. I adjusted it so now it can have up to +/-2.5 degree F swing. So if you set 65 it will kick on at 63 and shut off at 67. It can be adjusted so it stays at a constant temperature as well, but I was trying to get rid of the constant cycling during cold weather. Great product so far.
__label__1	All 3 with unusable LCD screens at night: We have 3 of these Lux systems in our sprawling house. All 3 have in a few short years had the LCD screens become unusable at night with the incorporated light. The programming part works well enough, The LCD is ok in a well-lit area, but we need to use a flashlight every time we want to adjust them. Not surprisingly, we adjust them less often. It is very frustrating and seriously compromises and otherwise good product.
__label__2	Excellent book to guide women through the divorce process: This is a thoughtfully-written book by two experts that answers all the questions divorcing women should be asking themselves, from whether to hire a lawyer or mediator to how to manage money and a household after the divorce. Written by women for women, it describes what to expect at every stage of divorce and includes very specific information on how and where to get additional help and support. I would definitely give this book to a friend who was contemplating or going through a divorce.
__label__1	"Irrelevant for some state & women: I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times."
__label__2	What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce and Custody:: This book was a god send. It helped me with so many issues. I found it to be a true survival guide with advice that works. I purchased the book months ago when I was first separated. Now my ordeal is almost over but I still keep the book by my nightstand and refer to it constantly.
__label__1	only about custody!: This book should be titled 'What Every Woman Should Know about Custody Battles'. I found absolutely nothing helpful about a basic childless divorce in this book. If you are going through a divorce and have custody issues, this might be okay for you. If you have no children, don't even bother.
__label__1	Awful: I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children.
__label__2	What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce And Cusody: This is the most thorough and informative book on divorce issues that I have read. As a divorce attorney, I am always curious to know what other attorneys are thinking. Ms. Smith's perspective and commentary mirror much of my own experiences and conclusions. The book is easy to read and filled with relevant, realistic examples and practical advice. I highly recommend this book to both nonlawyers, who have a reason to learn about this subject and to lawyers so they can refine and expand their knowedge of the divorce process.
__label__2	"This book is a real roadmap, precise and thorough: This book is an indispensable tool for any woman who is facing (or contemplating) a divorce with custody issues and who doesn't know how to even begin the process. It's a ""comfort"" book in the sense that it is precise and reassuring--almost a roadmap to follow-- especially when life seems out of control. This manual is a great resource to share with friends."
__label__2	From a Man's Perspective: I am soon to be beginning the process. I will be initiating it. I read this book to gain insite into a woman's perspective and possible strategies.I guess if you haven't read or learned much, this book can have some tremendous value. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about the process, it is good, but not the end all.One thing to remember, only 1-2% of all divorce cases are tried in court. Yes, judges approve them, but the real work is with the lawyers.It's clearly worth it price.
__label__1	"What a pity: What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
__label__1	Great coverage...lousy quality: The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch.
__label__1	"Don't waste your time: I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."
__label__1	Not worth the money!: This c.d. is definitly not what you are expecting. Some of the songs have like 3 different words fpr like five minutes. I definitly don't recomend it.
__label__2	"You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs...: Chumbawamba is an underground British band that has been around for almost 20 years. They had a stroke of surprising luck in 1997 with the infectious dance/sports anthem Tubthumper. However, that song is not a good representation of their sound. Musically they remind somewhat of Scissors Sisters with a little Frankie Goes to Hollywood or maybe a rebellious Abba with a few shots of whiskey in them. Their lyrics are very political in a very abstract way and written for a British audience at that. The CD is also filled with many anarchist spoken-word soundbites. I checked out their very active website and they are selling t-shirts with George Bush's face above the label TERRORIST and the back of the shirt says ""You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs"". Even Tubthumper is about ""shouting to change the world, then having a drink to celebrate""."
__label__2	"From the land of Tellytubbies...: Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to ""Amnesia"" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an ""A"" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly ""Creepy Crawling"", ""Mary, Mary"" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott."
__label__2	"DA BOMB: Chumbawamba rocks. It rocks because you can listen to it continusualy and you never want to change the track. The best track is the first one. I think it is ""Thumbthumpin."" I am surely going to buy this cd."
__label__2	A great CD full of terrific tunes and amazing lyrics.: This CD is the best CD I've ever heard! How did it go unoticed? It's full of terrific lyrics and fast-paced, exciting tunes. This is a must for all music lovers!
__label__1	Actually 1 stars: This CD sends the wrong message (anarchy), and some of it is just plain bizarre. Trust me, you'll tire of it. Save your money and go buy Barenaked Ladies.
__label__1	"These guys suck: Chumbawumba are the lamest band I've ever heard. The song ""Tubthumping is also so annoying. I heard the whole cd from a friend and he and I both think it sucks. I think these guys are just a bunch of ""one-hit-wonders"". Please save your money and buy something else."
__label__1	They get knocked down, please stay down again!!!!: Worst band ever, period. The final sign that the music industry cares not for talent. Basically like the fabricated Spice Girls only they could at least carry a tune. These guys can't even play a radio, just horrible. One catchy song that was ridiculous in the first place and even at that there was proof because it was only in regular radio play for about 5 weeks. Loserville has a soundtrack and it is sang by chump a whumpa!!
__label__1	"r u all kidding? this album sucks horribly...: yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that ""tub thumping"" is okay, even if it ""gets old after awhile"". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel."
__label__1	don't buy this cd if you don't like chick bands: this CD blows. tubthumbing was cool at first and then it got old real fast. the rest of the songs blow. I am so sick of this CD if anyone wants to buy it from me... wait I'll pay you to take it. I think they need to have a 0 rating instead of 1. don't buy this CD
__label__2	An excellent collection.: This CD is a wonderful collection of Chumbawamba's music. It is consistently good, slipping slightly on One by One and majorly on Smalltown. Unlike most CDs this had some great songs at the end such as I Want More and Scapegoat. I highly recommend it.
__label__1	Disappointing: I thought the Cd would be good after hearing Tubthumping and Amnesia but I was wrong..I feel that other than Tubthumping and Amnesia, there isn't anything about this Cd to boast about...
__label__2	happy songs: I love to sing along with this whole cd, which was once in my collection! I had to get the whole album--it has such a wide range of musical styles, all good tunes :)
__label__1	In war, this cd is played as torture to make prisoners talk.: This cd is the worst cd I've ever purchased... wait... I didn't even buy it... somebody lent it to me and they didn't want it back... I would NOT reccomend buying this cd to ANYONE... but if you have some money you wanna get rid of, you can buy mine...
__label__1	Where's the variety?: It may have some, but not much. Tubthumping gets boring after listening to it about 5 times. Amnesia is the best, but that song is OK.
__label__1	"So-so: I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
__label__1	Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon: With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.
__label__1	Skanky lightning in a bottle: I have heard many CD's in my day, and none have irritated me as much as this CD. They spout of phrases of anarchy and rebellion while doing the talk show circuit promoting this piece of crap. They seem to be the worst kind of hypocrites, ones with a bad sense of humor. Tumpthumping looses it appeal the second your hangover sets in and manages to sit in your head for the rest of the day. It seems destined to become a staple in the yuppie dance floors of the future. After sitting through the full 45 minutes or so of the Chumbawumba exprience, I reversed my stance on euthenasia. Stay away, fa r away. Unless you are completely lacking in taste, then you have my blessing.
__label__2	"If you think Metallica is kiddie-music...: This album is sweet. I originally bought it just to listen to ""Tubthumper"" but by now that has become my least favorite song. One of the postive aspects of the CD is the constantly changing tempo of each song. The many different styles and tempos in each song and the fact that the songs have some meaning make it all the more worthwhile. Buy this CD. You will find yourself headbanging to every song on this album in no time."
__label__1	"not worth it: i thankfully got this cd for christmas, so i did not have to waste my money on it, i liked ""tubthumping"" at the time. i had no idea about what a dissapiontment it would be. it's sounds too kinda ""un-musical"" i have no idea where they got some of those sounds from, but it's nothing that should be used it hte future. i have had this album for a whole year and still havn't listned to the whole thing.so, sample the rest of the somgs on a cd before you put it on your christmas wish-list!!!"
__label__2	"Caught totally by suprise...: When I got this CD (as a gift, I was really into ""Tubthumping""), I was very afraid that much of the rest of the CD would be garbage. I was very wrong. These guys (and gals) are more talented than anyone seems to give them credit for. There's something for everyone on this CD."
__label__1	"In the words of Dr. Evil, ""riiiiiiiiiiiigggggghhhhhht"": I'll be the first one to sadly admit, I bought this album only having heard ""Tubthumping"". That was a huge mistake. If you're considering buying this album only because of that, please DON'T! ""Tubthumping"" gets old after a while anyways. The rest of this CD is hardly worth listening to. There are some mediocre songs here and there, but trust me, this is not worth your [money]."
__label__1	Very Predictable: Much Like Most Bands Out Today Chumbawamba pretty Much Sounds Like every group out now.The Lead Off Song Got The Ball Rolling but the Album Sounds Like a Decade Late take on Jesus Jones.Nothing worth Seeking out here.
__label__1	Icky lyrics!: Tubthumber was the reason I wanted this cd and I got it. About 1,000,000 times on the radio plus 100 on the cd. Now I can't stand Tubthumper.The lyrics and music keep repeating themselves. All the other songs have bad lyrics that are negative too! This was not the best choice for me.
__label__1	STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!!: This CD is pure crap. The songs are pitiful and shaky. Your money would be better spent on ANYTHING else besides this cd.
__label__1	"AAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!: Minus ""Tubthumping"", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music."
__label__1	"Blech!: I used to not be a fan of modern music - this Cd almost turned me off modern music completely (it was a gift from a friend.) There is one good song on it: ""Tubthumping"" (I didn't know that was the name; I thought the name was ""I get Knocked Down."") Anyhow, that is the only good song. The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
__label__1	"uhm, why was this popular?: Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
__label__1	Nah: Tubthumping was Rad! But the rest of the cd doesnt stand a chance of being a hit, the rest is just terrible. I didnt expect any of the other tracks to be singles, and they havent, though they do have a sophmore album.
__label__1	This knife is Safe for no one: This knife is terrible. It was cheap, so I should have been dubious about quality. Save your money for a better knife since you can easily cut yourself with this knife. It's made of cheap plastic and soft metal parts, so don't count on the blade locking properly. It's an insult to even have a fire fighter logo. Don't make the same mistake in buying this poorly constructed tool.
__label__1	Good luck trying to use these things!!: These things are just about impossible to use. They are so difficult to stretch over any size bowls. I sat around the table with four family members (including one strong man) trying to fit these over various bowls...all we accomplished was flipping these things across the room! I originally purchased them for an elderly relative, but she couldn't use them due to her arthritic hands, but I soon found out that arthritis or no arthritis...these things are too difficult to stretch over bowls! Save your money and use some cling wrap.
__label__1	"PBS caves in to RealTV: This series is a huge disappointment, in comparison with the fine nature programming I grew up with on public television. The scientific content here is low, and thus the educational value is poor. Instead, we are treated to disaster porn--stitched-together footage of calamaties and their aftermaths, plus alleged ""human interest"" stories as shameless as anything on the six o'clock news. Insultingly voyeuristic, if that's possible for Americans these days."
__label__2	Informative and entertaining!!: I used this program for my science class. My students loved it! They learned some interesting facts, saw damage from earthquakes we talked about in class and never once did I hear that it was boring! Can't beat that!
__label__1	Disappointed: I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP.
__label__2	"I'm happy with mine.: I've had no problems with it yet after about 7-8 months. It's pretty fast once it starts printing. It takes a few moments to start a print job though. I'm using the USB connection so it could be my USB controller that's slow, I don't know. I'd buy another HP printer in the future. I just hope HP can make the installation process simpler.Color prints on glossy are not bad but don't expect them to look exactly like real photographs. Either I bought the wrong model for ""film camera quality"" pictures or ink printers just aren't up to par yet. ..."
__label__1	Not recommended: We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it.
__label__1	If you value your time and money then I'd something else...: I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year, and as it's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on, the printer has given me a hardware failure.Having said that I've tried it on different computers, with different cartridges (thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not), and it's dead. Now it's 4AM and I've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP #15 cartridge which is a #45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price.. you cannot use a #45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer. Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems (a school district recalled theirs), and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure.
__label__1	Not a very good printer: Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well.
__label__1	Limited life span: My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches.
__label__1	NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!!: I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!
__label__1	Avoid this one!: After returning two malfunctioning HP960c printers due to frequent paper jams, we bought the HP940 hoping it would work better. It was worse. The paper jammed or was shredded every second page. It took a great deal of time to print even one document. We tried the more expensive HP paper and the paper jams continued at the same rate. We were unable to print any envelopes at all due to repeated jamming. It is clear that the paper feeding mechanism is defective in these HP printers.We've had HP printers for years with no problems. We were loyal HP fans; however, we've had to return THREE of their printers in the past few weeks. That's unacceptable. We just returned the HP 940 and bought a Canon S630. So far, no problems with the Canon--a relief!
__label__1	"Don't Go There: Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now."
__label__1	Buyer Beware: I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership
__label__1	"Great But?: This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production. The ""But"" in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge. I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck. The rest is wasted. The two sided printing is great ...particuclary with all these programs now having the 'manual' on the CD to print...."
__label__2	Very Good printer: I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.
__label__1	It worked fine until I bought a new computer: I owned this printer for more than a year. It worked fine until I bought a new computer, I unplugged it, moved to a new place, and replugged it. The power supply burnt out. The printer was dead. I wasted 2 packs of unused expensive ink cartridges.
__label__1	"This is progress?: Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this ""upgraded"" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one."
__label__1	"A poor use of my money: I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
__label__1	FORMER HP FAN: Recently my 2+ yr old hp printer died and I purchased the hp940c.Installing the software took approximately 1 day. After spending over 1hr (my nickel)on the phone with hp (no)support (due to system error msg's caused by the installation), I hung up and determined the cause of the error msg's. I also have a problem with paper jams due to what appears to be a design flaw. I suggest hp quit focusing on the compaq/hp merger and get back to designing reliable printers. If not, you might just call yourselves UNEMPLOYED!
__label__1	Loved it, then it left me...: This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest. My first one was around for four years of college, then it died. The second, an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months. The 940c lasted me just over a year and died. Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive (I'm stuck with 6 of them) and don't last terribly long.I'm thinking laser to replace this one, and a Canon inkjet for color printing.
__label__1	Worked fine, broke quick: My HP Deskjet 500 worked for more than seven years before I finally traded up for a color printer - the 940c. I've had the 940c for just over 1 year and it has broken. I'm buying a Canon this time and keeping my fingers crossed for better quality.
__label__1	HP 940C: After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one.
__label__1	Bad printer: Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time.
__label__1	Extremely unhappy: I hate this printer! It is nothing but problems. Every single time I go to print even a single page, there is some sort of problem! The paper jams, I get timeout errors, the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits. The thing has a mind of it's own and starts spewing out pages even when I'm not trying to print anything. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't put trash on each page wasting my paper. It's a piece of junk! 1 Star is highly overrating this product!
__label__1	"worked great until it just STOPPED working at all!: I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
__label__1	"Save your money--buy something else.: I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support ""if you are still having trouble."" I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer. HP no longer means quality!!!"
__label__2	"Good for turns in a small space: These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track (33342). The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines (like the mighty red battery-powered engine) to drive through the curves. However, if the tracks are laid without too many ""bumps"" at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well."
__label__2	"Open minded german ""metal""?: With Heiland, Schweissers fourth album, the band takes a big step outside their metal-hardcore image. Most of the tracks show a wider range of styles, taking the very intense lyrics to an even higher level. All of the songs have a very good live feeling, always with an eye on the right groove (and who wants to bang his head to the same rhytm for a two hour show?) Knowing their new work ""..bitte warten"" (please wait) this was the needed link in between. Highlights are: Heiland, Meine Liebe ist ein Monster (featuring Apocalyptica), Friss Scheisse and Nachrechnen."
__label__2	Beecham as Wagnerian: Thomas Beecham (1879-1961) is not thought of today as a major Wagner conductor, but he did conduct a number of Wagner's music dramas at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and has recorded a number of Wagner overtures and preludes, including this collection.Although the early- mid 1950s sound will be an issue for some, I urge serious collectors to consider this recording, as it shows Beecham's mastery of Wagner. A great alternative to other Wagner collections of Bohm (DG), Karajan (EMI), Furtwangler (Naxos Historical and EMI), Bernstein (Sony) and Ormandy (Sony).Highly recommended.
__label__1	"Beautiful but poorly constructed: The scene itself is beautiful, but finding the correct fit for pieces is difficult. Most pieces are of similar shape and often multiple pieces with similar colors actually fit into the same place. The lack of piece shape diversity makes this puzzle annoying to me, perhaps challenging to others. This frustration did not make this a ""fun"" puzzling experience for me."
__label__2	Wonderful 3000 piece puzzle: I worked on this puzzle on a cruise and just had to buy it when I got home. It's a hard puzzle, but a wonderful scene.

The ones vertical in the bumper don't need as much attention, as they are covered by the fascia, but a light cleaning wouldn't hurt.The supplied spacer was too thick by 2/3 on my 91 Camry, so I didn't use it.

__label__2	Zsweet: This sweetener does not seem very sweet to me, but my husband will use it and he won't touch the blue, pink or yellow artificial sweeteners. I've used it in coffee and tea and baking and had pretty good results. I've mixed it with stevia as well. I don't detect any bitterness or soapiness, but it has a somewhat minty effect that is hard to describe. The mintiness is not really a flavor so much as a minty coolness. I find the yellow sweetener's flavor to be much more sugary than zsweet, but I wanted a sweetener that does not use maltodextrin as a filler.
__label__1	"I will stick with the pink or blue packets...: Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."
__label__1	Worse than Stevia.: Mild sweeetness - though ultimately tastes like soap - or something reminiscent of soap.
__label__2	Little Critters: All of these books that I have ordered are excellant. My grandaughter has me read them at least three times a day. We are both very happy w/ them.
__label__2	Your Signature Life: Pursuing God's Best Every Day: This is a beautifully written book that helps us to understand how what we say & do affects other peoples life's both at the work place and in our daily life. Dianna uses real life examples that show just how taking the time for a kind word or deed can make a difference in showing God's love to others. I highly recommend that corporations have all of their employees read this book.
__label__2	Asimov's early work his best: The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book.
__label__1	I almost read the whole thing!!!: 50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns??? A kid in the 2nd grade has more imagination!I almost made it to the end. It had gotten so absurd that it finally just drifted off to a shelf....What I didn't like:1) Lack of imagination (see above).2) Cardboard characters. Nobody to really cheer for..either the character is a pencil necked geek or some babbling fool.3) False religion mumbo jumbo: never would of worked IF most/allthe priests new it was a farce.Avoid unless you need something to stoke the fire with next winter.
__label__1	B-O-R-I-N-G: This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!
__label__1	Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels.: This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere.
__label__1	Trite, simple, unimaginative: What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else....
__label__1	What a disappointment: As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors.
__label__1	Melodramatic pulp: Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space. The repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable - I felt like I had read the same chapter a dozen times. Read the Cliff Notes, save yourself some time. *****
__label__1	Made myself finish this one to say I'd read it: I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein.
__label__1	"Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words.: The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."
__label__2	"Classic Sci-Fi: I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's ""Foundation series"" novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but ""Foundation and Empire"" moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."
__label__2	Classic SF: The middle of a trilogy that should be read in sequence. Lots of great characters and ideas. Asimov is the best
__label__1	Disappointing: I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way.
__label__2	Seldon knows better...: I read this novel as a trilogy of Prelude to Foundation, Foundation and Second Foundation. The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader.
__label__2	Outstanding Sequel!: This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)
__label__2	This was the best book that I have ever read!: Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!
__label__2	Fantastic!: This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)
__label__2	A sci-fi classic: Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know. If you like Sci-Fi, and are willing to put up with some of it's common shortcomings, this book will appeal greatly to you, for it truly deserves its place in the Sci-Fi canon.
__label__1	zzzzzz.....: I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book.
__label__2	It's NOT the FIRST book. Prelude to the Foundation is--AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE.: The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation. It's not available on Kindle. That's why they're lying to you, so you'll buy the one they DO sell.How's this for an idea, AMAZON: Just start selling Prelude to the Foundation on Kindle! Everyone's happy!
__label__1	Epic? Not hardly. May contain spoilers.: I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats, but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read.
__label__2	Interesting storyline: I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. I agree with other reviews that environment wasn't deeply described and there weren't any sophisticated characters, but this didn't disturbed me, because the storyline was fast-paced and interesting. I couldn't put this book down before it was over.
__label__2	Odd, yet unique sci-fi storytelling ...: Despite all the hype and negativity due to popularity backlash none can honestly admit that Asimov made a mundane focus for his writing passions when he wrote and then published the stories that comprise 'Foundation'. Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers.

__label__2	Science Fiction 101: So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more.
__label__2	Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ...: I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin.
__label__2	Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written: Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them.
__label__1	Bor-ring!: I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme.
__label__1	what masterpiece?: This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now.
__label__1	This is a cult book...: ... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future.
__label__2	The grandfather of SF books: If you're only going to read one SF book, this is the one. This was my introduction to SF many years ago and it's still my all-time favorite. Asimov was the original and is still the master.
__label__2	The first book of the best series ever. Period.: This book is the perfect kickoff to the greatest and most amazing Science-Fiction series ever. Asimov and his Foundation are the foundation of all modern science fiction. This book especially is a fascinating story full of characters so real you could expect to bump into them on the street, to speak nothing of the Doctor's amazing - and totally beleivable - futuristic technology.If you want to get a transcendental, literary experience or you just want to read a damn fine story, the Foundation series - and especially this book - are what you're looking for.

__label__1	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....Is it over yet?: Count me with the minority who found this book unreadable. It was incredibly dated with imagery very thin and sparse. I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish.
__label__1	Didn't Believe a Word of It: I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation.
__label__1	Foundation: The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars.
__label__1	One of the worst things I've ever read: This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse.
__label__1	Foundation [is not good]: ...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work.
__label__2	"Give the man SOME credit: Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for ""inaccuracy"" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."
__label__2	Good Book: I really liked this book,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people's perspectives at different periods of time. [END OF SPIOLER] I would reccomend this to anyone who likes books by Isaac Asimov or a story that takes place over a long time. ****
__label__2	On with the foundation: Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended.
__label__2	Going deeper: I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later.
__label__2	"The Zenith of Asimov!: I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
__label__2	Reading can seldom be this much fun!: Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation.
__label__1	"Confused about ""classic"" status: Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. ""Nuclear"" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"
__label__1	"Piece of crap from crap seller: I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape. The front cover is ripped, the spine has old sticker residue on it, and the back looks like it's been chewed on by a small animal. So much for being ""Used- Very Good Condition"""
__label__1	A Dud: Pssst! The Emperor has no clothes. All but a few seem afraid to admit it. Thank goodness for those brave folks who panned this vaunted 'classic' here. I only wish I had heeded their warning.
__label__1	Poorly written: This novel has a lot of ideas that do not fit together. The science, characters, and society are not memorable.
__label__2	He wants more...: I have nothing bad to say about this book. My 14 year old son read it, liked it, and he wants more. I am getting another Asimov book for him today.Read On !
__label__1	Well, it's Asimov: This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book.
__label__1	Dry Sci-Fi: I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.
__label__2	Ahead Of His Time.: The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time.
__label__2	THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE: I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it.
__label__2	A very well writen, exciting book about a possible future of: This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this.
__label__2	Great Book for any Age: I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever.
__label__2	"A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed ""Foundation"" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated ""Foundation"" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."
__label__2	"Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic Story: Before ""Foundation"" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."
__label__2	Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars: This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment.
__label__2	Good novel, but the other books in the series are better.: Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever.
__label__2	Get this book: Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more.
__label__2	Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!: Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one.
__label__2	Classic: I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre.
__label__2	If you like SF this is the one book you should read: If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!
__label__2	Science Fiction Masterpiece: Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime.
__label__2	Perhaps the finest sci fi series of all time: In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written.
__label__2	Best Book by Asimov (fiction): I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher
__label__2	"One of the best ever: This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
__label__2	Just kidding around: This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay. Nevermind.
__label__1	Still hasn`t arrived after two months: The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process
__label__2	The Genius of Asimov: I had read the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20's. The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more.
__label__2	Foundation and the complete series: Couldn't put any of the books in this series down. There is a college education in those books!
__label__2	"Unique transposition of our history: It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""..."
__label__2	Psycohistory: When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating.
__label__2	"A true Science Fiction Master!: As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Childhood's End"", along with modern-day cyberpunk like ""Neuromancer"", ""Count Zero"", ""Prey"", ""Cryptonomicon"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter"", etc."
__label__2	Foundation is a good read for all readers especially scfi fans: Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you.
__label__2	Amazing Asimov read !!!!!!: I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!
__label__1	Not my style: The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious.
__label__1	"first but not the best: No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated ""encyclopedia galactica"" entries was awkward and rough."
__label__1	letdown after the first book: I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page.
__label__1	Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.: It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's
__label__1	"Misleading: The title of this item says ""(3 books boxed set..."" however, when I purchased and received this item, I was only sent one book. I was expecting three books, especially for the price that I paid, and was only sent one. Therefore, I am rating this item very poorly."
__label__1	I just cant do it.: I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.
__label__1	Why is kindle version so expensive???!: Publisher: I will NOT buy a book that has been on the market since the middle of the last century in paperless format for these kind of prices. You've got to get your head back out in the open where you can see.Amazon: Get busy leaning on the publishers to bring their prices down. Why is an ebook as much as a hardback???This has got to stop. I think I'll pitch my kindle in the trash.Disgusted in San Diego
__label__1	"A very bad book: ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
__label__1	"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi.: I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."
__label__1	Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline: This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!
__label__1	Good printer, so so on photos, crap for envelopes.: I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it. Wonderful.
__label__1	TERRIBLE PRINTER: I've had this printer for a while now, and i rarely can get it to work properly. When it is not taking 2 pieces of paper at a time, it is printing in some strange code. The quality of the picture is alright, but nothing special. I would highly recommend not to buy this printer
__label__1	Don't do it!: I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer.
__label__1	DULLSVILLE: I saw his film when it was originally released. Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release.
__label__2	The Brainwashing of the American Investor: Brainwashing of the American Investor provided invaluable insight into today's Wall Street. Steve's personal experienceon the Street provides the reader with information that one only 'wonders about', but now it's in black print for all to see!Steve also provides enormous amounts of information regarding his investing 'style'---one that appears too simplistic at first,but is based on steadfast rules and established algorithms.I have definitely benefitted from the book--for personal edification as well as financial growth! Hats off to Stevefor a treasure load of info....definitely a 'small investment'for a much bigger payout down the road!
__label__2	A realistic approach to taking profits.: Mr. Selengut presents a realistic approach to investing. He identifies how to achieve continued returns from high quality stocks and bonds. He outlines basic criteria needed to make sound investments and sets realistic targets for profit. A must read for all investors who want to take the profit.
__label__2	"A must read if you want to save your money from the "" SHARKS: Written in a conversational style with plenty of humor, this book gives you the questions and answers you need to keep and increase monies that are being put away for investing and retirement. This book lays out a program for getting the best bang for your bucks, and gives an eye opening education on how the "" Market "" really works. I have purchased three books already and am purchasing five more to give to friends and relatives who want to salvage their portfolios from the ""SHARKS"" on Wall Street."
__label__2	Excellent!: Some of the reviews I've heard and read here and elsewhere contain criticism of Mr Selengut's journalistic style, grammar, spelling and even the relatively amateur way the book appears to have been typeset. SO WHAT?! If you are prepared to follow his easy-to-follow advice; to pay attention to the detail and to do your own individual stock research, it's worthwhile. I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509. Not bad for an investment of a little time every day and under [$$$] for the book!
__label__1	"a few good ideas spun out way too long: There are a few decent things here, for example the author's idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the reader Wall Street ""secrets"", and not enough hard analysis. And even the inventory metaphor falls down: Good stock picks should increase in VALUE, not just in price. And if they do increase in value, and the price does not get too far ahead of the value, they should not be too quickly sold."
__label__1	Don't waste your time: Ridiculously hard to follow the random thoughts of Mr. Selengut. The constant questions and change of font made it even more strange. Reminded me of teachers I had that may have KNOWN the subject but couldn't TEACH it at all.
__label__2	"Right on the Money!: I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson's radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. I heard enough to prompt me to search for his book on the internet. As a securities rep. myself, Steve appears to be ""right on the money"". I didn't want to put the book down until I was through. Steve's trading strategy is refreshing information that should make a lot of people a lot of money with less risk. I have even contacted him with a couple of questions and was pleased with his prompt and courteous response. Thank you Steve for sharing your success with everyone. In your next book, please remember that all ""advisors"" are not ""sharks"", some of us do put our clients first."
__label__2	Investing Made Successful: I heard Steven Selengut on a talk-radio program and was intrigued by the premise of the book. My intrigue led me to purchase the book, which was an eye-opening experience. After reading it, I'm convinced I had been sucked in by my former financial advisors to purchase products which I didn't need and cost too much. Instead of jumping in with both feet and totally revamping my investment habits, I've followed Steve's advice and gone into it slowly. I'm migrating from mutual funds (and annuities) to individual, high quality equities. My next step is to start purchasing bonds, as soon as the rates recover. Although the information provided isn't anything new, it was a slap in the face to make me stop my destructive investing habits.
__label__2	Still swings after all these years: For an album recorded nearly 1/2 a century ago (December 1956), Swinging Kicks doesn't sound outdated. The sound quality, while not up to today's digital perfection, is still quite listenable. The playing is awesome (lotsa power!), but what do you expect from guys like Maynard, Bud Shank, Ben Webster, etc. According to the liner notes, the tunes come from a film Buddy scored called The Wild Party (unfamiliar to me). Interestingly, some charts have 2 pianos (Andre Previn and Paul Smith). Originally produced by Norman Granz, 40 minutes. By the way, Buddy has a web site up with some interesting remembrances of his Songbook recordings with Ella - check it out.
__label__2	"West Coast - Forever C-O-O-L!: OK, so this album (whoops - gave my age away there...sorry, CD) is dated. So what? Some things are forever relevant and enjoyable, whether dated or not. I bought this album back in the 50's, lost it somewhere along the line, and have just discovered it's out on CD. My advice to any jazz fan is to BUY IT! There's not a better example of original West Coast Cool out there. The arrangements are interesting and varied... the section and solo work fabulous. My only (tiny) objection is that I wish there were a few jazz Standards included. But that aside, it's still a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and a MUST HAVE if you're into WCJ. By the way, Buddy has a fairly recent CD out now called ""SWING"". And does it ever! This one is full of old standards re-done in a kickin' modern swing style. Very innovative, although it may not appeal to the more snobbish ""swing"" purist."
__label__1	"Childish and lacking creativity.: This book was an enormous disappointment. Though it states it is a book for all ages, I would like to see my 25-65 year olds on my sales staffs, playing things like ""Rabbit & the Carrot"" or""Magic Carpet Ride."" This was for very young children, at best. Most of these games were not unique, creative, or interesting. A true waste of money."
__label__2	Energizers and Icebreakers Very Good for 4-H Club: We are using the activities from this book at our 4-H Club meetings. The age range is from 9 - 18 and I have had not problems finding activites that work for everyone.
__label__1	What are these guys?: Oh man. I don't even know what these guys are. Are they dogs, cats, or 5 dollar bills? I have no idea. I wish we could take a look at this movie 80 years in the future and see what futuristic space people have to say about busting boos with a vacuum cleaner. I mean the symbolism is magnificent, the vacuum cleaner represents the struggles of mankind to end racism while the boos represent Strom Thurman. It's a beautiful masterwork that takes a certain Narron/Dorinsky-esque look at how retarded you are for reading this review.
__label__1	"Some errors in book - disappointed: The book is okay, but there are some errors. Chapter 7, page 123, says that ""Protein synthesis begins with the transcription process"". This becomes a quiz question at the end of Chapter 7, but according to the quiz key in the book, the answer ""transcription"" is incorrect. Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed. Otherwise, if it weren't for these errors, this could be a great book - a five star instead of a two star."
__label__1	"A huge disappointment: This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else."
__label__1	Could be a great book....: This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).
__label__2	Nice Shape: The book was in great shape, very minty! Demystified books really have excellent ways of relaying the message definitely a great study aide
__label__1	Microbiology Mystified: What a waste of paper. Nothing useful in here at all. This is more for a third grader than an adult taking a college course. Find a better book or you will be sorrowfully disappointed.
__label__2	A must read for parents and teachers!: I love this book!! It is an easy read and provides problem-solving approaches and communication techniques that improve the behavior of children, teens, and adults. It further identifies social issues resulting in the breakdowns of our moral intelligence with reminders on how to improve.
__label__2	Puts into words and ideas moral concepts that can be difficult to explain: I have a sixteen-year-old who is questioning all morals. I was finding it difficult to put into words the importance of morals. I bought this book for her to read. She isn't reading it, but I am and I'm finding it very helpful in facilitating discussions with her. At dinner time I bring up one of the seven moral virtues and ideas that the book presents. I've found that it leads to great conversations with her about character and moral behaviors. It has given me the words for concepts that can be difficult to convey in our current morally challenging times. I recommend buying this book when your children are young and referencing it often.
__label__2	a great guide for a christian parent, or any parent: Very well written. Practical applications for implementation in your own family. I did not know how i was going to effectively teach our values to our children outside of trying to lead by example. This spelled it out for me. I have seen it work, my children are embracing these values and are developing characters any mother would be proud of. Even when they do wrong, they are usually aware of it and do apologize sincerely.
__label__1	"Stopped Cold: I had seen this authors' works offered for free on the Kindle page and since the price was right downloaded two of them. I was happily reading ""The Lamp In The Desert"" when I got to location 2458-61, and there in the middle of the page was the ""N"" word. Now I realize these books were written in a different time, and people had different morals and people were unenlightened, my problem now is, do I want to read a book written by someone so obviously contemptuous of me, no matter what decade the writer lived and worked in? I think the answer is NO! I was truly enjoying the book up until location 2458-61, and had even gone so far as to call my sister and recommend them to her. I am truly trying to be a bigger person and but I cannot truly support people who do not respect me. I am deleting this book and the ""Rosa Mundi and Other Stories"" today. Life is hard enough and I shouldn't have to fell insulted by something I bring into my home for pleasure. Sorry Ethel, ya gotta go!"

I thought this Viking part is compatible as it clearly says HP Part# P1538A by Viking on the Amazon heading. The computer couldn't boot up on installation. A phone call to Viking tech support says it won't work on e-pc series despite it being P1538A compatible. so beware!
__label__1	Big Disappointment: This book was a major disappointment for me. Bette was a very annoying character. She reminded me to much of Chloe's mother in the first book. Also this book did not seem a little bit cheesy to me. The fact that they decided to make Bette a spy just adds to how cheesy that this book is. The beginning and end of the book were wonderful, but the middle was very disappointing.
__label__2	Great for Begginers: This book is perfect for begginers. It shows you a skill and then has you try it yourself with the .max files that come with it. It has you learn by experiance rather than reading, but it helps you through it rather than making you go off on your own. In short, if your new to max then buy this book.
__label__2	Great! Must have it!: This book is a hands on training. It covers every aspect of the software. Excelent source for those who want to learn 3D Studio Max.
__label__1	Not worth watching. Stopped after 50 minutes.: The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch.
__label__1	"passable movie yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored: This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having ""A list"" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one."
__label__1	Bad, just bad.: Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this.
__label__1	Drawn out: After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film.
__label__1	Good acting but plot is stupid and it is not in any sense likable.: I usually like Nicolas Cages' work. He's a fine actor. However, his acting just couldn't save this rather stupid 2009 film in which he is cast as a drug addicted detective in post-Katrina New Orleans. No doubt he has a complicated life. His girlfriend is a prostitute, his father is a recovering alcoholic and his father's wife likes to drink a whole lot of beer. His world is one of drug addiction and corruption and there's not a single character that is in any sense likable. To top this all off, it is so boring that I fell asleep. Definitely not recommended.
__label__1	Booooooring: Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie based on the reviews I read before watching it. Yes, Nick Cage did a good job with what he had and Eva as always is beautiful but that is pretty much the highlight of the movie.
__label__1	"It doth suck.: I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."
__label__1	trying hard but fail to impress: If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all.
__label__1	I'd give it a zero if it would let me: Total trash, not worth the dvd it's written on. Horrific acting, crazy stupid scripting and terrible camera work. It's telling me I need to write more words to make the review count so I'll reemphasize that this movie is a complete total waste of time and energy and you should stay away from it. Don't waste your time!
__label__2	love it: great movie!!! cage is a great druggie i mean for being a cop. what a way to gain trust from the bad folk's.
__label__2	A hoot: This is a highly amusing movie shot and acted superbly. It reminds me of David Cronenberg's work. That and other reasons probably explain this movie's 98 reviews and 46 Likes vs 19 reviews and 5 Likes forMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?(cf my review). It is incredibly satisfying and must have been a lot of fun to make.
__label__1	Glad I have prime and it was free: Wife is a huge cage fan...This was torcher to watch....I would have given less than 1 Star if it was possible..Wish I went to the dentist instead of watching this movie... I have seen some bad movies but this one now has the honor of been the worst...
__label__1	Just Don't: Bad. Just bad. Somebody was on drugs during the making of this movie, I suspect it may have been multiple people. lol
__label__1	Is this movie a joke?: Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The acting, the plot, everything... completely just... BAD. Why do people enjoy this movie?
__label__1	Crap: This is a crap movie. Totally unbelievable, totally depraved. A piece of Hollywood junk. Don't bother, unless my description sounds enticing to you.
__label__1	Huge Waste of Time: Clean your house instead. Glad it was free! Would have regretted spending money on it. Tried to resume watching three times - couldn't' do it.
__label__1	Terrible!: Probably a decent story line but Nicolas Cage just needs to stop doing movies. The acting was just horrible. I would like the time back I used to watch this movie.
__label__1	junk: I tried giving this movie a chance... watched it all the way thru... even though I was going to shut it off multiple times... this is probably the worst movie I've watched ever...
__label__1	bad isn't fitting: can not believe I watched the whole movie, I kept hoping it could get better. Never did get any better, only worse
__label__2	One of 2010's Best films: Get this movie!! If you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this incredible ride of a film. Cage is nothing less than brilliant.
__label__1	Worst Movie EVER!: Horrible Movie, worst I have ever seen! Nick Cage's career is definitely over if it wasn't before this piece of garbage!
__label__1	AWFUL!: I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage movie I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap movie and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that movie, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I am glad it was free thru the Prime, thank goodness!
__label__1	not good: the service was good on this movie.. came quickly and in timely mode.. but the movie sucked.. it started off good.. but in the middle.. it lost its appeal.. he was a bad lieutenant.. but it just didn't catch and keep my eye.. and towards the end.. it was like.. what is going on.. it changed completely from the beginning..N. Cage is good actor.. but Eva.. she really didn't have a plot...
__label__1	SUCKS: this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.
__label__1	"Lost: 121 minutes: Well, that's 121 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Last year, I was compelled to see an animated movie about guinea pigs saving the world. It was the worst movie I ever saw. Now, it's the second worst movie I ever saw. Do yourself a favor and give ""Bad Lieuenant"" a miss."
__label__1	Dumb, Bad, Really Bad: This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies but this is so far beneath him I can't imagine why he would even do it.
__label__2	"All Nicolas Cage: He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
__label__1	Genius? Puh-lease! It's self gratifying garbage: I generally like Nick Cage even in his bad movies. This bad movie leaves very little to like about Nick or Herzog. Poor plot development is left to be interpreted by the visual arts and the script is even worse. Say whatever the other reviewers want, but I hated this movie.
__label__2	Drowning at midnight: I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer.
__label__1	Awful: It's just an awful movie. It's not quite as bad as 'Eye of The Beholder' starring Ewan McGregor, but pretty close. Awful acting by Kilmer, Mendez, and Cage. I'm not sure how anyone can rate this more than 1 star, but if that's what floats your boat. Save yourself a couple of hours of your life and watch paint dry or something along those lines and you'll be better off for it.
__label__1	Horribly Bad: Begs comparisons to Keitel's original and fails on every level. It never creates sympathy for the gritty immoral world this cardboard cutout inhabits. It's easily Cage's worst performance and the all time worst use of music in a drama ever. Unlike man of steel Keitel, this clown would have overdosed or been shot 10 times over. Any rookie cop could point out a dozen giant plot holes.
__label__1	Bad Lieutenant: Terrible movie from beginning to end, I stuck with this to see if it would get better but no! two hours later I wished I had gone out side and washed the car
__label__1	Bad Lieutenant = Bad Movie: I gave up on this thing halfway through. I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though.
__label__1	Very Bad Movie: Till now I've never seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie, this would be the first. We kept hoping it would end and will never watch it again.
__label__1	The Worst Movie Ever: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This movie only goes to show that Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer are definitely washed up as actors. I wish I could get my money and my time back on this movie. I just want to put my eyes out with a cordless drill thinking how much I watched of this trash before turning it off.
__label__1	Horrible Lieutenant: Worst Nicholas Cage movie ever made. See the Harvey Keitel version for a great watch.
__label__1	this movie is awful: there is no words to describe this movie! all i can say this movie sucks and it was awful!
__label__1	What a complete waste of time: This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long-long time. The plot is very unimaginative, and is active is plain horrible.There isn't much more to say.
__label__1	Bad, bad movie: Even Cage, with some genius acting in parts, couldn't save this bad movie.One of the wosre movies I have ever watched.Why do they keep hiring Eva Mendes - she acts like a piece of wood.
__label__1	Horrible acting, writing, directing: All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from.
__label__1	INFORMATION NEEDED: If you are a very senior Senior, be careful of the pop-up enticements you do not understand. There is no way I can ever view the movie I have been wanting to see for a very long time. I now know that I have DVD and not Blu-Ray, whatever that is. Reaching anyone to question is a near impossibility in this sales-mad world. The saddest thing is that I have not found anyone in my area to whom I can just give this movie in exchange for an opportunity to view it. Disappointed Old Lady
__label__2	"CAUTION:Duplicate: Bought this to add to my ""British Rail Journeys"" collection only to find that it is the same program that was included in British Rail Journeys: Vol, 1. from another distributor which is cheaper and contains two programs.(See my review.) No reason not to buy this but be advised that it is something you may already have."
__label__1	"boring: How did this collection of letters make it to print...when there are scores of personalities whose letters I'd love to read in a collection that haven't? These letters are very boring and he did not write to many notable people (a few to McCartney, Lennon and Olivier). Before you read about a theater critic, read what William Goldman said in his legendary book about Broadway THE SEASON, in the chapter titled ""The Approvers."" That tells you all about theater critics you need to know. THEN you can decide whether to read this one of Tynan's letters. I don't think this book would have made it to print if Tynan's wife hadn't been shoving it down publisher's and editor's throats. Dull, dull, dull, except for about five of the letters."
__label__2	love it!: I love this watch and get compliments on it all the time. I am an RN and have looked for years for a watch that performs all that this one does. Analog face, digital 24 hr clock,and many other features that I will never use. The best feature for me is the count down timer. I knocked off points because 1. there isn't a second hand, the seconds are digital display. 2. I'm concerned about the band because it is getting dirty and reg. soap doesn't clean it. The silver ring around the face really shows it off. Sits high and is a serious sports watch but I'm wearing it at the hospital.
__label__1	Not quite the booze I expected: This is an updated publication of a c. 1980 text. It is very informative on the properties of fuel alcohol and the different raw material possibilities. It also explains in some detail how to make ethanol on the farm-scale from improvised DIY equipment.It would benefit from a more up-to-date context and a slightly more commercial orientation, in my opinion.
__label__1	Ethanol is for drinking: I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home.
__label__1	"Needs a better string quartet: As a musician and musicology student, I am very familar with both the ""classical"" world of music, and the popular world of music, and I have to say that perhaps string quartet versions of R.E.M. might be interesting, but you need a creative and enterprising quartet (such as Kronos Quartet, etc.) to do this. This CD is greatly disappointing because the transcriptions are simplistic and lacking imagination. String quartet recordings can be very exciting, but not here!"
__label__2	Regarding Tribute to REM String Quartet.: Wow, I just bought this CD and I was surprised to see how poorly reviewed it was. Actually, that is the primary reason for my participation in this review... to offer a positive and encouraging reason to purchase this compact disc. I found the music to be refreshing and beautiful and, despite what other reviews have said, found the musicians to be quite talented. It's a good CD to relax to, have a dinner party to, et cetera. It's not REM, don't expect to hear REM. It is, however, a string quartet who brings a refreshing twist to most of REM's popular songs.
__label__1	"Not a tribute -- a disgrace!: A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. The idea is enticing, but the quartet's execution is awful. Truly terrible. Dull. Choppy. Uninteresting. Same. I'd say boring, but I can't stand to listen to it long enough to get bored. It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just ""The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M."" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too. Sorry to say it, but this CD is truly awful!"
__label__1	Skip the quartet, and go for the whole orchestra.: This is one of those albums I wish I hadn't paid for. It's an interesting curiosity for the REM fan, but I find it nearly un-listenable. The arrangements simply destroy most of the REM sound. My advice: pass this one by, and pick up the disc from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
__label__2	Lock Lace Brown: Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. I use the locks on other items, works great holding my hat on in windy weather.
__label__2	Great item!: I bought these as a replacement when our new puppy chewed the end off of a similar type lace on my husband's favorite shoes. They come with easy to follow instructions and after a few minutes all was as good as new and harmony was restored! (shoes are now kept well away from puppy!)
__label__1	Difficult to attach to boots: Too difficult to attach to my shoes...I prefer to tie my laces, even though I may have to do it more than once.
__label__1	"2 Unlimited is back, but not as you'd expect them to.: They're back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song ""Wanna Get Up"" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there's no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On ""Wanna Get Up"" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the ""SASH! Extended Edit"" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings."
__label__1	Finches love it but so do squirrels: This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now.
__label__1	Missing parts: I received this bird feeder, liked it, but when I tried to assemble it someof the parts were missing. The hooded pieces were missing.
__label__2	It's finally gonna happen!!! WhooHoo!!!: I can't believe this is finally coming to DVD!Three's Company has always been my 'all time' favorite show.I never get sick of watching John Ritter's extraordinary talent.I just hope the other seasons are released quickly.There are quite a few and I want them all!
__label__2	Great service: I was very happy with my product I absolutely love it!!! And it was brand new at a very reasonable price. Gonna continue my shopping on amazon.
__label__2	2nd season: Great item. Will buy more in the future. Great gifts. Thanks for your great and quick response. Thanks again. Goodbye
__label__2	Always delivers the laughs...: It brought home an old classic - I can watch these guys over and over again.
__label__1	horrid DVD: Love the show, which for me has held up well: it's obviously dated but still makes me laugh.What didn't make me laugh, though, was the quality of this DVD. The quality of the transfer, it's as though you're still watching it on VHS! It doesn't support surround-sound, even by just repeating the two channels.There are no subtitles in any language, and no special features of any kind!Worse, mine had scratches right out of the plastic! The scene where Jack comes up to the breakfast table in his speedos is all pixelated. Was that true for anybody else?
__label__2	Clear cut disc: no problems whatsoeverI remember why I love the show so muchthis DVD is much cheaper here than at other retailersI wonder why though only 6 episodes on the 1st season...maybe they needed for it to catch onthats understandablethere's a great memorial feature for John Ritter too
__label__2	Comedy doesn't get much better!: I remember watching Three's Company on TV, and I'm so glad it's available on DVD now... I have all the seasons! Seaons One introduces the group, and the laughs don't stop! I laughed out loud at every episode in this season! I absolutely love Three's Company! It's just so funny and entertaining! John Ritter (Jack) is classic... one of the best comedians! And the interactions with Joyce (Janet) and Suzanne (Chrissy) always makes me laugh out loud. For a good laugh, and overall great entertainment, Three's Company is tops! Enjoy!
__label__2	A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1: I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing.
__label__2	Best Show Ever!!: I loved Three's Company since I was a child, John Ritter is hilarious. I was upset when the Ropers left the show at the end of the third season, it was a lost! Norman Fell is so funny...I was devistated when I heard about John Ritter's death, he won't be forgotten...We will miss you, John. Can't wait for the second season. Buy it and you won't regret it. It makes you laugh so much...
__label__1	Show=Amazing , DVD=RUSHED: One of my favorite shows ever, the DVD itself was rushed to capitalize on John Ritter's death. This is what I hate about movie studios, it's all about the money and not about quality. Thumbs down to the transfer, thumbs down to the menus, thumbs down to the speed of menu access.Remember, I'm not rating the show because it would get 10 stars. The transfer is garbage.John you are the man. Sorry about this quality!
__label__2	Can't wait no longer.: Ever since I discovered that this was being released on dvd, I have been bursting out with retarded noises of delightful joy! I am very excited about the release of my very favorite televisionsitcom,Threes Company, because of the many laughs I get from watching it mostly. You will not regret buying it, and that is a guaranteed guarantee!
__label__1	A lesson to be learned: I thought that because the DVD stated Season One that I was getting the entire season one. Much to my surprise it only included six episodes. I now know that unless it states COMPLETE season it isn't. I was quite disappointed and feel that the advertising is misleading.
__label__1	Why not Spanish ???: Alguien me puede decir porque la serie Three's Company no viene ni con audio ni con subtitulos en ESPAÑOL.Esta serie fue vista a nivel mundial, si casi todas las series que salen en dvd con varios idiomas que paso con esta si es una de las mejores de todos los tiempos.Una comedia excelente y unica deberian de haber tomado en cuenta aca en mi pais la dieron con audio en español, donde quedo eso ???.Ahora si viene en audio ESPAÑOL o por lo menos subtitulo pido mil disculpas pero no dice por ningun lado en la descripcion del producto.SALUDOS
__label__1	JACK THE IDJIT: I think Three's Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Bad writing BAD acting and JUST PLAIN BAD all the way around. The horrible thing was it was SO bad you sometimes felt compelled to watch it in spite of your better judgement. PAINFULLY stupid plots.
__label__2	Where's your underwear?!!!!!: I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. I really appreciate that the producers put on the DVD season extras, and left the shows 100% complete. No commercial interruptions is such a nice treat. I remember they used to show oodles of commercials between the segments, and cut them up, in syndication.Love it!MC White said: Check it out!
__label__2	A Legend: Three's Company will always be the best comedy show that was on TV. When I heard that John Ritter had passed I did shed tears for the man because he was the best and will always be the best comedian out there. I have been waiting for the show to come out on DVD for a very long time. When I was a kid I would beg my mom to stay up so that I could watch the show. John Ritter will be deeply missed by all his fans. Rest In Peace John, we all miss you!
__label__2	three's company: I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. This is my favorite show. You must buy this TV show this is the best ever. I have been watching this show since i was little. I just love John Ritter shows and movies he is so funny. I'm going to miss him. Rest in peace John.
__label__1	Spanish: In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.
__label__2	"Classic!: Yes, you can catch this program running in syndication frequently on many different channels, so why buy it? Well, I started thinking about a time in the future where it may cease to be aired and I feel this is a show that will continue to make me laugh way into my golden years :) . Yes, the situations they get into at times is over the top, but I know that I like watching television to ""escape"" my life and this is great entertainment. All of the actors do a great job, but John Ritter was a genius in his acting and comedic timing."
__label__2	"Excellent, albeit short, DVD presentation.: This is one of those ""it's about time"" DVD releases. The first season of ""Three's Company"" was a short one, given only six episodes. But it was wonderful to see them in their original colorful, vibrant presentations. The show stands the test of time and this is a must-own DVD for any classic TV fan.The only fault, naturally, is the lack of features and the small number of episodes. It might have worked better if they had combined this with season two and released a loaded collection next year. As it stands, season two will be released next year and I fully expect a five-star collection."
__label__2	a good deal: Alot of people have complained that this could not possibly be the entire first season of the show but it is.... Even if the show had such a short first season it was still a really good deal. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it's a pretty good aswell!
__label__2	"CLASSIC: This is the season that started it all. Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season. The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper. The only problem? The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: ""The Ropers"" and ""Three's a Crowd."" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication. Watch this set and you'll see why."
__label__2	Great 1st Season: Yeah,great start to the series.Pity there is only 6 episodes in the 1st season.Already watched it loads of times.John Ritters humor as usual stands out.No extras on this dvd.But all the episodes are good.Here are the episodes.01. A Man about the house02. And Mother makes four03. Roper's niece04. No children, no dogs05. Jack the giant killer06. It's only moneyBuy it!So we can get all the seasons released.This show rulz.
__label__2	Thank You!: I am sooooooooooo happy that this show is making its way to DVD. With so many other shows getting to DVD, its nice to see a true classic in stock. Plus, with season one being on DVD, I won't have to try to record the episodes on Nick at Nite every night (although I just might).
__label__2	A must-have: I grew up with Jack, Janet, Chrissy, etc. I watched all 6 episodes straight through one night and laughed my butt off with each episode. The only complaint I have is that there are only 6 episodes and I was left wanting more. I can't wait for season 2!!
__label__2	jack, janet, and chrissy: The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter.
__label__2	Come And Knock On Our Door.........: I was THRILLED to find this at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I LOVED this show growing up and now owning it and watching it again just makes me smile and brings back those memories. What a great show. We we always think of John Ritter fondly and miss him greatly.
__label__2	Come And Knock on Our Door: I got this for Christmas,and I haven't watched it,yet. I want seasons 2-4. We'll miss you John Ritter,Rest in Peace.I'm still waiting for 8 Simple Rules Season 1 to come out on DVD.
__label__2	=^): this is such a cute show! even after all these years im still in love with all the charactors and even the reruns are fun to watch. EVERY season of Three's company's great, definatly worth the $$
__label__2	three's company: this is one of the best comedy ever in the world tv until now i am still watching this comedy every time
__label__2	classic television: What can I say about this show except it is a good example of what a classic series is all about. Any John Ritter fan has to add this to their collection. I intend to purchase the entire series.
__label__2	Very Funny: These are just as funny now as it was when i was little. These DVD's are an excellent gift for the Three's Company lover in your family.
__label__1	"Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money: I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."
__label__1	Not of good quality!: In the picture it seems bright, cool, So I ordered! I received it few days back.. not good looking, not of good quality!!
__label__1	did not warm up to the book: the book came highly recommended, but it didnt humor me and I couldnt warm up to the authors style of writing. bored me too...sadly gave up half way into it.
__label__2	Buy Things From These People: I ordered a rare CD that I had a lot of trouble finding in other places. It was cheap and got to me over two weeks earlier than Amazon estimated. This vendor will be at the top of my list when I purchase my next CD.
__label__1	if you are buying cuz of Pearl Jam don't...: The Ramones meet AC/DC. A live record with the song covered by Pearl Jam. Not a great recording. The songs are good, would rather hear studio versions. If you are looking to buy cause of the Pearl Jam song.. don't waste your money. Otherwise they are a good band but the production is no good!
__label__1	Netherlands?: If it is called Hard Wired in Ljubljana, why was it recorded somewhere in the Netherlands? Ljubljana is in Slovenia--a country on the other side of Europe...
__label__1	Nasty book, nasty woman: From a woman who sold out her body ages ago and now attempts to be a partisan hack, and poorly at that. Why anyone would want to wipe their feet on this dirty carpet is beyond me. Not worth the time it took to phone in sex.
__label__2	Hot non-fiction: If you've ever thought about working in the porn industry, even as someone behind the video camera, photo lens or website, this book gives you a good idea of what you are in for. Take a curious, brave and intelligent woman and thow her together with a very industrious former stripper with excellent business sense and you'll see the sparks fly between this odd couple in this surprisingly suspenseful non-fiction story.
__label__2	Romero x Rambo: Curiously, the track #36 (To Canada) was used in the 1st teaser trailer of the new Rambo movie. For a film filled with so many deaths, it was quite an appropriate choice, wasn't it?
__label__1	"Buzzing renders it useless: It's light, it's convenient, it's easy to use. But what does it matter? In the end, the unit produces so much buzzing that it renders itself useless. It's just too annoying, and I would not ever want to watch the footage. I've been working with this for a year, sending it back and forth to Canon, and they tell me there is some ""allowable buzzing."" They actually replaced mine, hoping it would appease me, but the second unit was exactly the same.I've now missed filming the first 19 months of my daughter's life because of this. Canon doesn't seem to care much. Time to sell it on ...."
__label__2	great beginner cam: one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense.
__label__2	Easy to use!: -Excellent little camcorder.-Very impressed with its features.-Easy to transfer your moviesto a computer.I do not regret spending my moneyon it.
__label__2	Love it!: Well, I'm going to have to bunk on the previous reviewer. I love my ZR45MC and have for about 10 years. Have not noticed the humm mentioned, however, will admit sound pretty much stinks; internal mic picks up too much background noise. That said, picture quality is fab. I use mine mostly for scenics, not talking heads, so a music track takes care of the noise. Interface with my Mac is on a kindergarten level. Plug it into the computer, the software starts and the computer asks if you want to download clips.Today I am looking for an external mic to see if I can solve the noise issue. Otherwise, can't think of a reason to get a different camera.
__label__2	very good..& easy to use: This is my first digital camcorder. As a first timer its very easy to use which I liked most. without the tape i hooked to my Sony VIAO PC and within 10 minutes I made a small movie. the setup is so easy. to transfer the video I used IEEE port which comes in Sony VIAO and the Movie Shaker software.the quality is awesome but the quality of the digital still pictures are not excellent, but its ok. for starters and home movie makers its more than enough in a single camcorder
__label__1	Another nightmare about the remove cassette message: I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk.
__label__1	"Very annoying humming sound - be sure it doesn't bother you: Basically a nice unit. Loaded with all the features you could ever want: plenty of optical zoom, digital stabilizer, very compact size, reasonable warranty, and good looks too.BUT...this camera has a VERY annoying buzzing/humming sound to it. I called Canon and they said it's ""normal for that unit."" Excuse me?Maybe for some people, the buzz is not annoying. But compared to my cheap, old 8mm, this is much, much noisier. I would recommend you try it before you buy it. Don't get wooed by the display models."
__label__1	I liked it at first: It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam.
__label__1	BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!: I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it.
__label__2	Great Camera: This is a very easy to use camera with excellent video. Read the reviews and did not hear any humming noise when operating and the low light pictures were very good. The still pictures are good for the internet but are not good enough quality to use as a regular camera.
__label__2	Not good enough: This camcorder is good enough for me except for one thing: if you are going to need a light or external microphone you should get the ZR50MC because of its advanced accessory shoe. The lights and microphones that I can find are designed for the advanced accessory shoe. The built-in microphone is too sensitive to use in many cases because it even picks up the sound when I tap the handle of my tripod lightly.
__label__1	Remove the cassetter problem...again: As with others, this was a great camera until the remove cassette problem appeared 8 months ago. Now it barely plays or records. I'm never buying another Canon and going back to Sony. BTW, the buzzing is the automatic microphone gain. If there's not enough sound to record it cranks up the input volume so much that you hear the tape motor.
__label__1	Horrible...: I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.
__label__1	Nice camera, when it works: I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera.
__label__2	Gets the job done right!: I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers--super sticky and gets the job done in record time.
__label__2	A great CD: Yeah, yeah, we know she has a loaded last name; anyway, a CD ought to be listened to on its own merits. As far as I am concerned, this is a keeper.Charlotte Gainsbourg's soft, mellow voice perfectly fits Air's melodies.
__label__2	5:55 Charlotte Gainsbourg: What a great album!!! I never knew she sang as well. I have seen her in French movies and enjoyed greatly her acting in those movies. Now I even adore her more, because not only can she act, but she can sing as well!!!Go Charlotte Go!!!! Can't wait for her next album.
__label__1	"She can't sing!: This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."
__label__1	"hollow, lame and prescindible...: I bought this album in the hope of finding some kind of chic, interesting tunes ""a la French"", to match with her voice that I remembered from the past, but there's absolutelly nothing interesting inside: some elevator's music that won't disturb you in any given context. Utterly prescindible..."
__label__1	KAY ARE A PEE: Um, hello? Has anyone noticed that this woman doesn't know how to sing? Most songs are an over-baked litany of melodramatic metaphors that add up to ... what? Others appear to be some sort of short story told in the past tense. All are whisper-talked by the artist in her faux Gallic/Brit accent that wears poorly as the CD progresses. The few times when the producers require her to actually hit a note are cringe-inducing.I wanted to like this record and spent $15 of hard-earned cash on it. But I guess there's a good reason why she's only dragged out of storage every ten years.
__label__2	"A different Charlotte: Charlotte Gainsbourg 5:55 borrows more from ""Air"" than from her father Serge, and is a complete departure from her previous works. I had hoped that she would've stuck to French, but being the daughter of British singer/actress Jane Birkin (after whom the famous French luxury goods maker Hermès named one of its lines), her English is impeccable and sounds quite sexy. This is a good, solid performance, albeit not one that will keep you awake."
__label__2	"Red Allen's hot session: Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra (""Queer Notions"" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry ""Red"" Alllen's slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad ""I Cover the Waterfront"" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20's and 30's was a bit more advanced..."
__label__2	Reporting World War II, Part Two: My wife is the reader and she dearly loved this book. So down to earth and factual.
__label__1	korny: One of the worst compilations ever. Some of the new synth music is cheap & corny. Even the ganymede song is bad on this album. I like my synth music to have some meat to it. All these songs sond like little kids playing new wave for a day. If you want some good new synth new wave music check out de/vision and Iris and mesh.
__label__2	Excellent Ski Tours for the Western Sierra: This book has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. Describes some beautiful country. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevatnion, navigation, time, and season. The USGS topos for the tour are listed, along with excellent tour maps. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you thorough the tour.I like the book, but I would also like to see an index and more tours for the Yosemite high country.
__label__2	A Watershed Work!: This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me.
__label__2	A good review of the facts ...: It is a catechism ... what more to say? It does the job, presents the facts and gives a lot of information in concise form that can be used for further study. What it is not is a prayer book, philosophical discussion or flowery inspirational work. It is a catechism.
__label__1	Not for novices: Not very useful. Perhaps too high a level for a layman like me. Seems to be written for a serious student of Buddism.
__label__2	A Good Synopsis of Mainstream Buddhism: The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book.
__label__2	if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book: from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
__label__2	Provides a great foundation for further studies.: This is a very handy little book. It answered many fundamental questions I had about the Buddhist philosophy. The book helped me to realize that I am a Buddhist - no matter where I am in my path.
__label__2	Excellent!: I have several photography books that I have had no desire to read from cover to cover. Then I found this one! This is by far the best photography book that I have laid my eyes on. I am reading it cover to cover and plan on reading it again. John Garret has written it in such a fun, simple way that really makes you understand photography. I've even learned more from this book than I have in a photography class that I have taken.If you are just getting started in your photography adventure, I highly recommend this book!
__label__2	great book, good service: The book arrived in a little more time than I expected, but it was within the time frame indicated. However, I am happy with the book's condition. It's better that described. Great book and price.
__label__2	"Good Overall Book: I just took a photography course and this book was one of the ones recommended. It is a little shallow, but covers all the basics and all the items covered in the class. It covers all the various topis from portrait to building photog as well as types of cameras, etc. If you want a basic book, this is the one to get. However, if you are looking for a lot of depth, keep looking. Then again, it is ""Keep it Simple"" so it delivers just what it says."
__label__2	KISS Guide to Photography: While old and out of print, this book is a very good way to learn the basics of photography. You have to ignore most of the references to digital cameras as the technology has changed a lot.
__label__1	"outdated!!! although several book been out there for a long time, this book is also basic: I bought this book two months ago... It's outdated.It might include the information you are looking for, but at a very basic level. I went with the ""Undestanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson, and with ""The Digital Photography"". Both have outstanding reviews... and these will do the trick teaching you what you need to know to take great/almost pro photos..."
__label__1	Plastic pulley, not metal.: The pulley is plastic, not metal as pictured. I've added a photo to show the actual item that I received. The tensioner was made in Canada, according to the label on the box. The plastic pulley might be reliable, but I purchased this item based on the image showing a metal pulley.
__label__1	Mixed Bag: This compilation contains some of the best jazz guitar ever in songs like Scotland I, the Jam with Albert and Yin. Unfortunately it also digs up silly tripe like Eyes of Love, Planet End, Adam Smasher and Rene's Theme. The shorter compilation, the Essential Larry Coryell is less expensive, more consistent and manifestly superior to this double CD.
__label__2	"Great take on unlikely standards...: Gelfand and his acolytes make solid and original jazz out of music usually associated with children. These arrangements are simply delightful, my favorite being ""Passe-Partout"" a theme I knew by heart as a 4-year-old in '78. Gelfand not only arranges the themes well, his interpretations and solos on the piano shows that they could have a great new life as jazz!"
__label__1	Belkin poser: Ordered a Belkin, got something unknown. Part number on unit (BI13-120100-AdU) doesn't match the advertised one. What's up with that? $11 is too much for a knock off brand.
__label__1	Should be Free with purchase of Belkin OmniView. Why sell separate?: This item should come free with a Belkin OmniView. Seems amazon and sellers are deliberately selling separate to make more money by charging shipping and handling for an item that should ship with Belkin OmniView when a customer is purchasing one.
__label__1	Amigo?????: I ordered a BELKIN and received an AMIGO.Not what I ordered and when I complained...I was sent ANOTHER AMIGO.Get a clue. Don't shop Amazon!
__label__2	"Delicious Electronics...: I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection. Happy Gooves...."
__label__1	"Not As Engaging As I Had Hoped: I'm not a huge dance/techno/electronica/call-it-what-you-want fan, but I do dabble. And seeing the addition of vocals, bass and guitars to a dance outfit piqued my interest. Unfortunately, it didn't hold it. Nothing really bad here, it just didn't make much impression. ""Drop the Break"" is OK, and I liked the trance-y feel of ""Yallah Habibe"". The only other impression I got was the rather silly lyrics on ""Abduction"". Serviceable for background music, but not really an album I could get into."
__label__1	Not as good as Counterfeit CD...: To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.
__label__1	"Reaaally sucks!!!: The only song that's worth listening to on this album is ""Break in"" and it can be found on Superstar DJ Keoki's ""Transatlantic move"". Go for his album instead..."
__label__2	AWESOME: I love this book. It is some cool. I always look words up whenever I am stumped in music theory or just in my practice. It is a very good buy!! I recommend it to anybody who is into music. :)
__label__2	"Can't Get Enough of GLAD's Acapella Projects: Like most things in my life I experienced GLAD in reverse of release dates. I thought it impossible to improve upon Project III and then I experienced Project II. Their variations on Christ the Lord is Risen Today sends cold chills up and down my spine and All Glory Laud and Honor Him makes my heart swell for the praise and worship GLAD offers to millions of Christians worldwide. I'm so very glad I've added GLAD to my music repetoire. ""I say Rejoice, I say again Rejoice"" And, as is my pattern, I will now search, find and experience Project I. Happy Acapella Harmonizing!"
__label__2	Great Read: Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads.
__label__2	Loved this book: You hear about prescription drug addiction but don't really understand it. This book takes you into Barbara's life with such an addiction. The writing is excellent. There is so much detail regarding her struggle back to a normal productive life. I have a new respect for individuals and their families with this illness.
__label__2	"Still One of the Best: A number of books about substance abuse have come out since ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,"" but it still should be on the bookshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Gordon's straightforward description of the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms endured by a recovering addict has a powerful universality. It helps all of us understand the complex and excruciating process of recovery. - Ann Seymour, author of ""I've Always Loved You"""
__label__2	Very good heart wrenching story: I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.
__label__2	Now I'm confused ;-): I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about.
__label__1	Review of book: I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!
__label__2	Liked it: This was a fascinating look at mental illness. I could really feel her pain and understand how easy it would be to slip into this state.
__label__1	"Needy: She seemed to be ""ill"" when it was convenient for her. All I kept thinking about was how she should have thanked her lucky stars that she and her family could afford all that treatment.I really kind of wanted to smack her and say Snap out of it!"
__label__2	realistic: I found this book very realistic. As someone who suffers from mild mental illness, it made alot of situations real to me. I enjoy the NYC mentions as I have recently visited New York. I could visualize the book well.
__label__1	dry: This book was really dry... there were a couple interesting moments but most of the book was a lot of unnecessary words. This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!
__label__1	"great book BUT DONT BUY THIS VERSION: Not sure exactly what went wrong here - but this version of the book is RIDDLED with laughable typos. Horrible punctuation, missing words, random periods thrown in everywhere. ""ERIC"" becomes ""ERIE"" throughout. What the hell? Was this reprinted by monkeys?DONT BUY THIS VERSION."
__label__1	Out of date: fading fast: When written, this books topic was well known. Individuals and styles of communication were well understood.With time, the people and places Con Price refers to are only familiar to a few local individuals-and only important in regards to this fund of knowledge.I am currently working with Dr. William Thackery of MSU-Northern, Havre, Montana to upgrade and update the book and subscript the text for improved reading, relevance, and accuracy. Once done this text may be a leading contribution to the history of Montana and Southern Alberta.Yours,Ruth M. Burleigh P.O.Box 608 Chinook, Montana 59523 (406)357-4255
__label__2	Also useful if you live in Europe: You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe.
__label__1	"VERY limited lifespan: I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Either the keys didn't respond at all or if you pressed one key, multiple letters appeared (""a"" became ""as""; ""q"" became ""qw"") and it was impossible to return. One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month, so it wasn't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars, I would."
__label__2	Mean Guns: This movie is not for everyone. The story line is good but some parts of the movie are just to far fetched to make this a great movie. But if want something different like watching a solid 90 minutes of over a hundred people geting shot, stabbed ,and/or beaten to death. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!
__label__1	Dumb Guns...but great soundtrack: Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental.
__label__1	"Mean Guns Doesn't Mean Any Good: This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing."
__label__1	In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder: I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in.
__label__1	"A very strange and bad movie: Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for ""Omega Doom"" and ""Crazy Six"", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. ""Mean Guns"" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film."
__label__1	Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!: I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched.
__label__1	"OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream: Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the ""Dream"" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average ""Joe"" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much ""practical"" information about ""The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop"". Definately a dream."
__label__1	A lovely book, but short on specifics.: This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere.
__label__2	Excellent and informative: This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals.
__label__2	Packed with info: I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in.
__label__2	"Very useful eye candy...: Yep, there are a lot of ""dream shops"" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are ""monitarilly challenged"". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."
__label__1	Not worth it: Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well.
__label__1	weak advice: The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made.
__label__2	"Nearly Sanders Best: It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."
__label__2	"Great CD: This is a great CD. Buy It. (You know you want to) Every track is hip and contain a variety of styles and elements from great vocals to some of the more ""out side"" stuff. This CD can be enjoyed by people who are not hard core jazz fans."
__label__1	He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!: This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch.
__label__1	"Avoid: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
__label__2	Good stuff: I have always had trouble finding the perfect toner for my skin type. I have oily skin but it is also extremely sensitve to burning and tingly toners that contain alcohol in the ingredients. I have tried a lot of toners, and this is truly one of the best ones I have ever used IMO. It is very gentle and does not produce a burning or tingly sensation after application. It has a great, light, clean scent and does an effective job of wiping away any remaining oils/dirt on your face. I like to use it after cleansing and prior to any day/night moisturizers.
__label__2	Amazing: Within 24 hours of using this product there is already a huge difference in my skin. I love it! It's light, it smells great, and it really does what it claims to do.
__label__1	"Can you do basic math and science, MGM?: Mad Max and Escape From New York are two titles I would consider essential to have in my BD collection, but I will not be buying them in their present state. Why, you ask? Let us do some simple science and maths:Science in the sense of positing a fact: I watch all my discs on a 50"" plasma television, and listen to them with a receiver that decodes 7.1 channel lossless soundtracks via the HDMI ports.Hence, Blu-ray + DVD = NOT GETTING MY MONEY.It really is that simple, MGM and anyone else who is contemplating force-feeding consumers what I now refer to as a holdback format. I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD. So when the UK Amazon offers Mad Max and Escape From New York without force-fed DVDs, guess who is getting my money?DVD is dead. Face up to it. It died the day that BD spoke up and offered us the experience of progressive television."
__label__2	Is this remastered version?: What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. No computer image, no sfx, natural good old film. I love this film.
__label__2	VERRRRRYYYYYYY GOOD: This movie is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this movie hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes.but the action is the reason to watch this. The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of.
__label__2	Mad Max to the Max! Well, almost.: What can I say. This movie ROCKS BIG! It is full of fighting, bad words, threats, cool heroes, evil villains, and everything else that makes an action movie good. Like guns, bladed weapons and determination. It follows a man who means to stop criminals and terrorists in similar ways to the Punisher. It has cool quotes and good graphics for a 70's movie, and I liked it a lot so I am looking forward to the sequels, Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. If you like bang em up movies with morals, see it.
__label__1	Cult classic...: There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either.
__label__2	I LIKE TURTLES: I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape.
__label__2	Great movie: a good collection and will be a long time favorite a movie to be never forgotten. Mel is a good actor
__label__2	"Fitting beginnng of an epic: ""Mad Max,"" the first film in a much-imitated but never equalled ""action"" tragedy/trilogy, perfectly sets up the following two movies. Together, they form an epic of one man's losses of all he loves, his ruthless revenge, and his eventual redemption, beginning in ""The Road Warrior,"" when he grudgingly assists a commune whose members repay him with treachery. Despite that, his metamorphosis comes to fruition in ""Thunderdome,"" in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one, and the one to see is ""Tim,"" in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get. This man has amazing talents, to the ""Max."""
__label__2	PLEASEEEEEEE: IF WHAT YOU SAID KENNETH MARBURY IS TRUE, EVERYONE GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH THE ORIGINAL ACCENT AND THE CUT SCENES.
__label__2	Buy It!: The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge.
__label__2	CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence.
__label__1	Warning - badly dubbed dvd: Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars.
__label__2	"The Special Edition has arrived - BUY IT NOW!: This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released.Both widescreen and full screen versions are included, but more importantly, the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored. The difference between that and the clunky, awkward American-dubbed audio most of us are familiar with is like night and day (and if you want to find out for yourself, both are included on the disc, so feel free to compare).Rounding out the package is a making-of featurette, several trailers, and a ""pop-up video"" style subtitles-option which presents various minutea about the film and its locations while you watch."
__label__2	Mad Max (Special Edition): I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already. I knew the movie before buying it, liked it, which is why I bought it.This review is to let folks know about the Special Edition. For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad. I mean, he's mad, but I always thoughtmad was supposed to mean crazy. He's not all that crazy. Makes for great alliteration though.
__label__1	"Cut Version: Guess I should've known better than to buy a ""special edition"" This has scenes edited out. I'm very disappointed, what a prude sissyfied country America is these days. ZERO stars for this version. Original version gets FIVE!"
__label__2	"typical chick flick: What you're looking at here -- or at least, the product I think I'm writing this review for -- is the very first ""Mad Max,"" the one that put a young Mel Gibson on the map. The later one, though, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" is the one everybody knows.This one is low-budget filmmaking at its best.Two points:1. For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original ""Australian"" into American English. What an insult. Really, how dumb do they think we are?2. Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3. How'd they get that music? Wow. That was an impressively well-done score.4. Film was crying out for aerial shots! Too bad they apparently couldn't afford a crane or helicopter."
__label__2	"Solid Prequel to Superior ""Warrior"": Finally this thing has been enhanced for surround. It is about GD time!!! Lacks one star because Road Warrior takes it one step to the next level of high intensity. Interceptor motor kicks butt on the old surround sound rear channels too!"
__label__2	Post Apocolyptic Action At Its Best: A post-apocolyptic wasteland. Peace officers in hopped-up hotrods. Renegade bikers. What else does a film need to offer to be a five star masterpiece?! One of GIbson's earliest films, Mad Max continues to be one of his greatest achievements, both as a film and as a character. I give this film five big stars! This is a must see film.
__label__2	Great work! Fuel injected suicide DVD!!: Wish I have a MAD MAX 2 DVD like this!! This is a great DVD, with the 2 versions on it!! the American dubbed version is a great wild cartooned movie. And when I hear the true Australian version... the movie becomes more serious and real!! amazing. Some of my friends prefered the old dubbed version, but I prefered the 2 versions!! The Stereo sound of the engine of the yellow interceptor when Max is waiting for the knight Rider is superb. The image is the best, and this DVD have the choice to see the movie in 16:9 or in a 4:3, wish all DVDs have this option when movies are filmed in wide screen. If you like Muscle Cars crashing, runing, etc. you must see this...
__label__2	Mad Max (1979): A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement, this George Miller flick features a young, then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second movie role, as top-cop Max Rockatansky. After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark.
__label__1	"Dubbed into American English: This DVD is the U.S. release, in which the original Australian dialog (including Mel Gibson's) was replaced with dubbed dialog in ""American English""."
__label__1	Blah: I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters. The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson.
__label__2	"Mad Max is Cult Classic: How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under? Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang. The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence ""Mad"" Max. Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase scenes."
__label__2	"This is where ""road-rage"" originates!: If you worry about how much you pay for gas, read this book! END"
__label__1	"Nothing more than car crashes: Why on earth would anyone give this movie three and a half stars (out of the traditional four star system)? I kept watching this tedious film, hoping that perhaps the answer might be found in the next scene. This is a confused, jumbled mess. It's an unintelligible, incoherent, impenitrable story that makes absoloutley no sense and goes from nowhere to nothing. Each scene seems to have nothing to do with the one before or after it. As best as I can figure it out, it's a wierd cross between ""Duel"" and ""Death Wish"", but no where near as good as either. The action is disappointing too,unless you like seeing vehicles getting wreaked."
__label__2	Mad Rod: For a long time i've been waiting for this dvd, it becames my way of life, i bought a CB750 and a F-100 V8. These kind of vehicles really amaze me.
__label__2	"Cult Classic: In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
__label__2	Cool early effort of Mel Gibson: Mad Max is a very good movie.It's loaded with action,and it's got a good(but kind of strange)musical score that really adds to the feel of the movie.The plot is pretty good.It takes place sometime in the future(at least from when the movie was made)in Australia.The highways of Australia have become very unsafe,with biker gangs running wild.Most of the film is about a very nasty gang,led by a crazy guy called the Toecutter,that is out for revenge on a cop named Max,who they blame for the death of their friend the Nightrider.(he died in a fiery crash toward the beginning of the film,after an excellent chase)After the gang kills Max's wife and baby,he becomes the hunter,and the gang the hunted,and Max gets revenge in the end.This is a very good film,done on a very small budget.The only version I've ever seen is the American,I would love to see the Australian Sometime.This movie is followed by an excellent(and bigger budget)sequal,The Road Warrior.
__label__1	Mad Max 1: I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars.
__label__2	The best of the Mad Max triolgy: The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star.
__label__1	Mad Mel: I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in.This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!
__label__1	This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, I must say that this movie is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic movie can get. The majority of the movie is explained on the back cover- Mad Max is a cop whose family has been killed and he must seek revenge. But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!
__label__1	"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
__label__1	Don't buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market: It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version.
__label__1	Not worth buying!: I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!
__label__2	Gives you a nice urban 'western' type film - Mel , not Clint: This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call .This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it .Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras .
__label__2	Great: Bought for my BF. He really loves Mad Max. Figured I'd just go with the blueray-DVD combo since the price wasn't bad.
__label__2	not as go as the road warrior,but a very good low-budget action movie: in this first mad max movie mel gibson(looking very young) is a cop in the near future where war and crime is pushing the world into a new and deadly dark age. motercycle gangs roam the road ways and sack and pillage everything they can get their hands on! after several run ins with them,max sends his wife and child away to protect them,only to have the gang find them and kill them in a most unpleseant way. now max,half mad,sets out to kill them all,at any cost!while not as great as the road warrior,this is a dandy little revenge movie and has some great stunt driving! this sets up the reason why max is so cold and mean in the road warrior and it makes the road warrior that much better if you see this one first.the transfer is great and the use of the non dubed soundtrack helps make this one you need! check it out!!!
__label__2	"Good revenge-type movie: If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in ""Australian language"" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing."
__label__1	mad max: this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed
__label__2	"When do we go for a ride?!: Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of ""Mad Max"", but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!"
__label__2	Dubs are BAD: Do not, under any circumstances, get this movie dubbed if you have the same opportunity to get it in its original sound format, with the original voices. The original is far superior to the dubbed version, no matter how difficult the thick Australian accents of its actors may be to understand. While it is a good movie even with the dubbed voicing, it is a far better movie with all its original voices intact.
__label__2	Dubbing is bad: Good movie, bad dubbing. Please releast the origanl version. I took one star off becuse of the dubbing.
__label__2	A household name...: I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS.
__label__1	Red only when off.: I replaced the amber bulbs of the turn signals with these ones. My car has clear lenses and unfortunately these bulbs are so bright that they look reddish, like washed off, they don't have enough red coating to look RED.I was looking for something to look the same color as the stop lights, these bulbs don't do it.
__label__1	Barely red enough: Sold as red, obviously.But I find them to be more pink than dark red. I'm sure they're still legal (or hope they are), but not the look I was hoping for / expecting.Otherwise, they work fine.
__label__1	The Sword in The Stone: There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!
__label__1	The sword in the sux: Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book. Its very confusing and boring its so long I did not like it !!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2	The best fantasy I've ever read.: THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy
__label__1	The childhood of a legendary king: The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+.
__label__1	A Waste of Time: This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone.
__label__1	worst book i have ever read in my life(and i read lots!!!): i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it
__label__2	There's different versions of this story!: T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?
__label__2	Thin and bends easily, but very pretty: I really liked this ring. It is very pretty and just the right size for me.The silver is very thin, however, and bends very easily. I put it on my middle finger, and when I took it off, it was bent out of shape. The good thing is that it was bent to mold to my finger and was very comfortable, even for being so wide.
__label__2	fairies dancing on my head: I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album.
__label__2	"Worth the effort it might take: Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. ""Captain Easychord""), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found ""Margerine Eclipse"" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for ""Dots & Loops"" and ""Cobra & Phases"" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens."
__label__2	A complex, multi-layered masterpiece: Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn't reach out and grab you at first. The album takes many listens to appreciate, but once you do, you'll realize it's a masterpiece. Microbe Hunters was the same way...hard to absorb at first, but eventually rewarding. Aside from the first track (a repetitive instrumental), every song is pure quality. Buy it, listen to it several times.....you won't be disappointed!!!
__label__1	Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday
__label__1	Huh?: I loved Carabee and Moghul, and I thought Samurai would be more historical fiction, but I was sadly disappointed. I got as far as the 50% point having struggled in vain to understand all the financial concepts in which I was drowning and not giving a damn about any of the characters. And I quit!
__label__1	"disappointing: Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world. The only thing missing from this ""B"" grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys. Not at all what I had hoped for."
__label__2	Japanese high finance mystery: Interesting story about how Japanese business and government could take over American business and technologyRealistic people portrayed from both sides of the Pacific.
__label__2	Decent shoe: Good, sturdy platform for squatting under a barbell. Very firm. Laces are long enough to wrap around ankles, and back of shoe forms a fair notch to retain the laces and keep them from sliding up and off the shoes - would have been better had there been a rear loop. Shoes are better without the insoles because they put a spongy foam wedge under the heels. I replaced them with thin flat insoles from a pair of water shoes. One could cut the foam wedge and use the included insoles. There is no raised heel other than that foam wedge. They run true to size or slightly tight.
__label__2	Fun....: This is a fun project to do if you have a short amount of time. It's simple and easy for kids to do on a rainy day. Everything is included and it takes just a few minutes to set up and clean up.It's not a FANTASTIC, GOTTA HAVE IT item, but for the money, it's a good craft project. If you buy those magnets at a craft store, you can glue it on the back and use them on your fridge or give them away to relatives for Mother's Day or the like. :)
__label__2	Fun fantasy: I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept.
__label__2	Make a wish!: 'A Simple Wish' is a cute, fun family film. It's about a young girl named Annabel (Mara Wilson) who wishes for a fairy godmother. Her brother thinks there are no such things as fairygodmothers. Well, Annabel's wish comes half true. Instead of getting a fairygodmother, she gets a fairygodfather, instead! Anyway, soon they meet an evil fairygodmother who they try to destroy. It's very fun and really cute. I saw it on TV and it was very good. All the actors in this film give great performances, and the script is pretty good, too. I definitely recommend this film for families everywhere!
__label__1	Family film: I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
__label__2	GOOd: a gift for my friend he loved it is a child movie and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping
__label__2	Cute film: This is a fun film about a girl who wants a wish, and a fairy godmother (or in this case, godfather) Her wish is not even for herself, it is for her father. However, the fairy godfather is not very good at magic, so he is unable to grant her wish right away, and falls afoul of a witch who wants his magic. Overall a fun film for kids, and adults might enjoy it too.
__label__1	Mara Wilson: I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part
__label__2	"A little of everything: The plot and cinematography of this film were above average, while other aspects were a little lackluster. The storyline was well written, and the casting was on target, however the mixture of computer graphics took plenty away from the film and cheapened it quite a bit. Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical ""Evil Witch"" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in ""Matilda,"" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled ""Un Semplice Desiderio"") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it. Granted I may have never even seen this film if it werent in a lot of videos I bought from ebay.it :)"
__label__2	A must see!: This movie is very entertaining to both adults and children. It is a fun and witty movie that you can watch again and again and still have a good time with! I would highly reccomend getting the video
__label__2	Well worth seeing! Martin Short is excellent!: We rented the video and then went out and bought it. It's entertaining and fun for both kids and adults. If you like Martin Short, there are a couple of scenes that are really worth seeing.
__label__2	Happy Escapist: Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat.
__label__2	A stimulating toy but a little too heavy and hard: My daughter first started reaching for this toy at about 4 months old. However, her arm control wasn't developed enough to keep her from smacking herself in the face. Not a problem with lighter toys made from softer plastic. This one is pretty hefty and I had to keep one hand on it at all times. Now, at 6 months, she's doing better and can play with it without risking a black eye.For an older baby the toy is great. I don't think she's really into the beads yet, but that will come as she grows. For now she loves the colors and shape of the toy. It's easy to grip and makes a fun sound.
__label__2	Easy to hold rattle: This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time.
__label__2	Voltaire - Genius of Mockery: Voltaire Genius of Mockery book is about the life of Voltaire, French philosopher, poet and novelist. It covers his entire life from birth to death. Each page comes alive and one can picture his joys and his frustrations as he battles the repressive Catholic Church and the French monarchy over the publication of his books, his plays and his personal philosophy. Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution. One also gets a glimpse of the life in the 18th century through his relationships with Fredrick the Great, King of Prussia, Madame du Chatelet his lover, and Louis XV, King of France. One will understand his stories, such as Candid when one knows the man and his smile.
__label__1	Poor quality: I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well.
__label__2	Upbeat Christmas Songs That'll Get You In The Spirit: If you don't like Kenneth Copeland, then please don't write dumb, childish reviews that have nothing to do with the product. I just had to say it. The other reviews on this CD are purely based on their personal distaste for the man behind the songs, which is not how one rightly rates a product. ANYWAY, this CD is great fun to listen to imo, whether you like/know who Kenneth Copeland is or not. Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to. This CD has been a part of my family's Christmases since it was released in 2004, and will continue to be. Why? Because the music is good and it gets you in the spirit of Christmas, that's why! Highly recommend this product.
__label__1	Ask Santa for some ear plugs: Home for Christmas. Sounds innocent enough. But you would be well advised to stay away from this home. It is a horrible place. You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd. Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate. How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes. But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must. After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!
__label__2	Mini Blinds something I always put off cleaning.: With this tool you can keep your mini blinds really clean, the brush reaches into those impossible crevices. And I now dust my blinds on a regular basis to keep them looking really great. I was most pleased with this product, especially since it saves me those extra steps of cleaning!!
__label__1	Product did not work like I thought it would: Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
__label__1	Did not like: I did not like this item or how it worked. I guess it just isn't whatI wanted. It did not work like I thought it would. Attachment would notfit snuggly into vacuum hose. Was hard to insert between blinds and did notclean as well as I wanted. They were really dirty but I ended up using anotherproduct.
__label__2	A return to early Trout: Closer to the Truth is a cd that rekindles the emotional music of Trout Fishing in America that was prevelant in Truth is Stranger Than Fishing. Every song on Closer to the Truth is a powerful emotion. There is no bad song on this cd. The albulm starts off with Dreaming which sets the listener into a daydreaming mood and goes straight into a remeniscing melody (Old Things). A light-hearted skeptical shortly follows (Dangerous). You will be humming the chorus all day after that song. Alberta Postcard will paint you a picture and make you want to visit Canada while There You Go will bring you back to the mortality of life. The icing on the cake is the finale (The Sun the Moon and Stars). This is their best song on the CD and will bring you to tears. It took Trout 10 years to match the quality of Truth is Stranger Than Fishing, but Closer to the Truth matches it and then surpasses it in their best Adult albulm to date.
__label__1	Expensive: 38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull. especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store.
__label__2	Timeless and just Awesome!: I love Felt! great band and I have all of their recordings. This one is probably my favorite in their whole catalogue. Dreamy Psychedelic and heartbreakingly beautiful in places. I will never get tired of this recording. Maurice Deebank is an incredible underrated guitarist and Lawrence is perfect at what he does. A truly great recording that the average listener will never understand. Genius!
__label__2	Johnny Zoot rocks: Although this CD has been out a while, I just purchased it. WoW!I was blown away. Johnny Zoot really rocks. I especially liked the note he sang on Cobwebs. The lyrics and feel makes me sad but that is a testament to the strong emotions which Jonathan Zoot summons from the bottom of his soul.This band would have been one of the tops in the 40's and should be today with the fine musicianship and bass/vocal prowess of J. Zoot.I have a small dentist practice in my town and have made my patients listen to this when they are tied in their chairs and they almost never complain.Thanks Zoot people.
__label__2	"Swing! Swing! Swing!: I enjoyed the diverse ""moods"" of this CD! First and foremost was it's swing beat....then I liked the blues style. I would have to say my favorite was ""Kopasetic"" followed closely by ""Rat Face Rudy"" and ""G Man"". I enjoyed the humor that was cleverly added to the lyrics in the latter two. Some of these songs will certainly add some ""zing"" and ""pazazz"" to your day."
__label__2	1924-P Silver Peace Dollar: I purchased this coin for my Mother as a birthday present because it is the year she was born.It is exactly as described on the bid sheet, and I am well pleased.
__label__1	everybody BUT Hendrix: This video shows managers,roadies,and freinds, talking about THE MAN. NO complete songs even in the background (which is the only place the music is). If you want to see Hendrix play, it's not here.
__label__1	Disappointing. Too much talk...not enough music.: Only about 1 hour long, and most of this is talking. Somewhat interesting, but I wanted Dolby Digital Hendrix!
__label__2	great video: hearing about how this Musical Genius made this Landmark album is a real treat.it's a timeless video about a timeless ARTIST that Trenscended music&time.
__label__1	Lame talk, the music speaks for itself: This is a very dissapointing DVD. If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him. The music and maybe the pictures as background are enough.
__label__1	Should be called a documentary!: I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise. Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing. Disappointing...
__label__1	Who mixed this thing??: I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!
__label__2	pleased with my purchase: I bought a Suburban that the previous owner had a little too much fun with. The mirror was broken and I needed a replacement. I called the dealership and gave them my vin to get the actual part number. The Left one and Right one are one number off from each other. Make sure you check with the dealer before you buy to get the actual number for the right wire harness... They wanted $450 for the replacement. I went with this one and it works fine. It doesn't have the feel of the factory one, but all of the mechanics work perfect. I recommend buying a pair. They won't match your stock one on the other side if you buy only one. But they look good together. -J
__label__1	Highly disappointed: I bought this to be a part of my daughter's train set, and have been nothing but disappointed. For starters, the red circular center piece can easily be removed, and I anticipate the day it comes up missing permanently. The wood is slightly bowed, and though it does not impede play, I was expecting a higher quality of toy (this is Brio after all). The most disappointing thing, though, was how small the turntable is. I knew it would not support the larger engines (e.g. Gordon and Henry), but I was surprised that even mid-sized engines such as Edward and James would not fit. I wish I had kept the box because I would love to return this item.
__label__2	"Peace & Positivity: This CD is blazin'. Slim Kid of the Pharcyde is really doin' his thang. Tre is rapsanging over smooth tracks. This CD won't get you Crunked....but sometimes U need to simmer down and just chill out. And this is what this CD does. Chilled, laid back, with positivity oozing from every single tracks. MC Lyte, Charlie 2na, NDea Davenport, and the ""Slam"" artist Saul Williams add their essence, making all 17 tracks a powerful blend. My favs are Ayyomyman, Roots, Love, & Culture, & Playing House...But no doubt, all tracks are hot!!!! Don't sleep on this CD."
__label__2	Incredible album...: Tre Hardson (of the Pharcyde), is without a doubt one talented individual...this album is incredible and should be owned by everyone interested in hip-hop and quality music...The only artist I can compare him to is K-os from Vancouver, BC...flows, lyrics, some singing...this is dope...and I listen to artists like Killah Priest, Billy Woods, Mr. Lif and Reef the lost Cauze. Peace
__label__1	disappointing: I've read several Bayer novels and enjoyed them very much. After hearing that this novel won an Edgar award I was eager to read it. Well...that must have been a very thin year for Edgar nominees. This book was a severe letdown. Totally unbelievable and it got sillier and more ridiculous the more pages I read. Honestly, I can't believe Bayer would even want this one still in print. His other novels, and the ones he has written as David Hunt, are very good. But this one reads like the work of an amateur by comparison. Give it a miss.
__label__2	Innovative design, excellent execution ...: I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!
__label__1	"one of the worst books I ever read: I tried to read this book when it first came out. I couldn'tfinish it. There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient ""cities of the red night"" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it."
__label__1	wow, what a mess: If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story.
__label__2	Get Out of the Defensive Position: Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist. This novel impressed itself to the point that I met one of the characters in a dream, a truly disorienting experience. Sure, it's disjointed. Innoculation to the parasitic authority of the word virus, to see and feel in another medium, whaddaya think the poor guy's tryna say here, anyways?
__label__1	"strange incomprehensible mess: I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!"
__label__2	Bleeding Gums: Fierce symbolisms that rips out the guts of whitebread America. The most profound gem is Burrough's prediction of the AIDS crisis. He was able to capture in this book the symptoms he saw develop in the homosexual underground years before it was announced to the world at large.
__label__2	Cities Of The Red Night: Cities Of The Red Night is one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The novel has different storys that as the novel progresses intertwine. The books presents situations that are unbelievable but because of Burroughs genius you are convinced of that they are happening in a world not too far from are own. I think he was trying to show the questionableness of what is presented to us as reality. This book also has some of the most vivid pictures and unforgetable lines that I have read. It is Burroughs masterpiece.
__label__2	Need to understand German: Stephan Sulke is one of Germanys songwriters and story tellers. Unless you understand the german language you will not have the privilege to enjoy his music and lyrics to the fullest. The songs on this album are truely some of his best. Comming out of the artists heart and life the storys behind the songs have a bitter humor. i can only recomend this cd.
__label__2	Awesome!: This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
__label__1	One's own dreams are better than this!!!!!: This book is not one that you quickly get through. It is very slow and dull in both story content and happenings involved. I would not and have not recommended the book since I purchased it. Actually, I threw the copy I purchased out because I did not want to subject anyone else to the boredom! If you are one that likes slow moving and unreadable books, then this is the one for you. I did not find it the list bit funny or have any true emotion over the book at all -- except for the fact that it is a waste of money!
__label__2	The Best!!!: I agree with everyone else, Rashel Jordan(the Cat) is definately an awesome character. Off all the nightworld books, this is my second favorite. Rashel is bull-headed and will not be dominated, but it is amusing to see her get knocked off her feet by her soulmate Quinn.
__label__2	Loved It!: I really loved this book! It has my second favorite pair of soulmates in it (Ash & Mary-Lynette being my favorite). This book reminds me a lot of my favorite show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I think they even mention the movie in the book... Anyway this book up there with my top 5 favorite L. J. Smith books. They are all so good that it is hard to decide an exact order. so if you haven't read it yet then I suggest that you do.
__label__2	Wonderful and Dramatic: Basically, Rashel is searching for the vampire who killed her family when she was a child. She comes upon an enclave of vampires, and, ironically, falls in love with one. His name is Quinn. He is also the fosterling of the vampire who killed Rashel's family.Well written and suspensefu
__label__1	This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.: I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house.
__label__1	"Rashel: Ugh, I don't get it how all these people can like Rashel. To me she was an extremely annoying person because it always seemed like she was bragging about her ""amazing fighting abilities"". Also, she would always make these ""quips"" that were supposed to make her seem tough, impressive, and heroic but just made me feel like once again she was being annoying. The bad thing is that she is like this the entire book. The book has a nice plot and everything but if I can't stand the main character then that just ruins everything. Sorry."
__label__2	read mi review. sorta like ads.: this book rocks, people! however, i got reali confused withnyala's character. what's up with her aniway? split personality?aniway, i reali loved rashel and quinn though they were always at each other's throats!! enjoy this book! p.s : if u're reading these reviews to decide whether it's worth ur money, i tell ya, get it QUICK before it's all gone!
__label__2	It was the best Night World book!: Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
__label__2	Randy is a dog's best friend...: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book.
__label__2	"A Must Read!: Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. ""How can I?"" he asks. ""Each one says, `Don't leave me here.'"" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption."
__label__2	truly beautiful: Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time.
__label__2	"Marie Curie - An Inspiration for All: The book is a reprint of the biography written by Marie Curie's daughter, Eve Curie in 1937. It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said ""No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit."" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."
__label__2	Great Book for Young Women: Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective.
__label__2	pistol packin' mama: Florence King is one tough broad: a meat eating, heat packing, bisexual Republican who has NO patience for whiners, slackers,huggies, fuzzy wuzzies, or anyone even remotely PC. But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout. You go,girl!
__label__1	An odd coverage of an uninteresting event: The author points out that this series of crimes is of little importance and has largely been forgotten. It will remain so.
__label__1	Do not buy --This is just a chapter -- not the book .: This is just a chapter of the Volume 4. Do not buy it and save your money. These sellers are so clever that they give no mention of the pages -- hence fooling us into buying these thinking them to be books .Go buy the book -- The emergence of Industrial Societies.
__label__2	"Kyle ""the yellow dart"" Smith's review: A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time."
__label__1	AVOID !!!: If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!
__label__2	Great Alaska singers: JoAnn and Monte are two of the best Alaska singers I have ever heard. Back in the early 80's we purchased some tapes from their show in Juneau and are sorry to find out that we can't get CD's now. It seems that nobody carries updated versions that are truly some of the best Alaska folk songs. I was thrilled to get this CD and wish I could find more.
__label__1	"Film fails to capture the magic: The quality of filming is so poor, the beauty of the music and the singer are lost. I saw the ""30's version of this as a child, and I wish I could get that....this was a real disappointment. Munsel sings beautifully, but the film itself is boring, and the quality is poor. Unless you really, really love Munsel and the music, don't buy this film."
__label__2	Better than Therapy: Try this album after a rough day at work. Or better yet, while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear, crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically, following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence, as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic, with deceptively simple, yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s. Hard to find, but worth the effort.
__label__2	Lotus Flower Purchase: Amazon makes it easy to find obscure releases from lesser known artists. The one-click shopping is easy to use. The item was shipped and received very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.
__label__2	Great Puzzle: My 3 year old granddaughter loved this puzzle. It is very colorful I would definitely recommend this puzzle. It is very well constructed.
__label__1	Substandard Product: Here is the timeline of this product:After first two plays, little wood pieces started chipping off;In about two weeks, the pictures started peeling off;In about one month, layered wood started falling apart.Will I still buy puzzle from this company? Maybe, no one else selling small puzzle set for toddlers. What choice do I have? But I do pray to God that somebody will be making a better product soon and drive Melissa & Doug out of business.
__label__2	Love these puzzles: I have purchased several M&D puzzles for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves putting them together. Very durable and colors are so vibrant.
__label__1	Poor quality for the money: For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable.
__label__2	Melissa and Doug Playful Pets Jigsaw puzzle 12 pieces: Puzzle is big and colorful and interesting to look at. Purchased it for when my 2 year old grandson comes to visit. He loves it! I already purchased another puzzle with a different pic. he loved this so much. I recommend purchasing these puzzles they are fun for little hands and sturdy too.
__label__1	Wood chips off: The pieces of this puzzle are definitely no for kids..or even adults.Its made of poor quality wood and easily chips off.It chips off into such small pieces that can easily embed in anyone skin or even be eaten out of curiosity.Did not expect it from a M@D toy
__label__1	This product should be recalled: Please don't give this to your children.It is a nice puzzle with fun colors and pictures at first sight. But it was made of layered wood, and the edges of each piece are full of splinters. I got two splinters into my fingers by just taking the pieces apart (not to mention how tight it is). I can not imagine how the little ones play with it. It will absolutely hurt their soft hands.Sorry to give this negative review. The design of this product is good, but two things have to be done to make it acceptable: 1. polishing the edge; 2.making it less tighter.
__label__2	Very pretty and good quality: My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
__label__2	Fun Jigsaw!: I was troubled over what to get my son for Christmas this year but when I came across this jigsaw I knew my search had come to an end. This jigsaw will help him cope with the stresses of being a modern day 4 year old surrounded by electronic stimuli 24-7. You can't go wrong with Melissa & Doug!
__label__1	Not recommanded: After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time.
__label__2	"Jigsaw Fun from Amazon: I gave this puzzle to my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for Easter. She had been doing 12 piece puzzles which ""slide"" together. This was a little more of a challenge since the pieces are ""jigsaw"", but she was able to do it. The edges are a little ""rough"", but our older ones may be smoother from many years of use."

__label__1	This is high density module: This is high density module. It works only with a fewmainboards. It does not with the two I have.Amazon.com - please correct me if I am wrong.
__label__1	memory problems: This Kingston memory isn't recognized by my computer which is only about a year and a half old. I went and used SimpleTech memory instead which works just fine. I would not recommend this product.
__label__1	Use caution with your computer: The description doesn't address the compatabilty issue with your computer. In my case, I purchased two, and had to return them both, since neither was recognized by my computer. Although the seller took them back for full credit, it's still a hassle, and a disappointment that it didn't do what was hoped it would. The rating doesn't necessarly rate the product, since it couldn't be rated because it was not compatable, it's more towards the lack of documentation regarding compatability.
__label__1	Didn't Work: Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems...
__label__2	Excellent buy and compatibility: I needed to upgrade from 128 MB to 512 MB. The memory got to my home through UPS (plus a dog bone for my dog) within about 5 days. Installed easily once I figured out where HP had the memory on the motherboard (behind the drive chassis!). Everything is working like a champ. Excellent buy and compatibility for an upgrade.
__label__1	Doesn't work in anything I put it in.: I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory. I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go. Wouldn't work in two other systems I tried. The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems. Mine is going back.
__label__1	Unhelpful and rude tech support: I found that this module wouldn't work in my computer,though industry-standard low density memory workedfine. Kingston technical support confirmed that thiswas high density memory and would not work in my PC.When I asked them to swap it for standard memory, theresponse was that I bought the wrong memory, and itwasn't their problem to exchange it to make it work.I'll not buy Kingston products again.
__label__2	Over 1,000 models referenced: This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun.
__label__2	How does Hilton do it? Magic? I can't figure out why his books are so moving.: Not Hilton's best, but still somehow a gem.An aimless Englishman poses as a peasant in Revolutionary Russia, & subsequently tries to wander his way back to Western Europe, discovering on the way something more important: a reason to live--but too late?Despite these problems:1) the plot, as the travelers, wander terribly,2) the supporting characters are usually either stock or flat,3) the 'suspense' usually fails, as event turns are often predictable,4) slow start; unsatisfying ending.the story still somehow works, and works well!I just don't get it. Hilton violates cardinal rules of a good novel and still somehow turns out a work that wrenches my frozen heart.Must be something in the manner of the telling.If you like this story, you'll love Hilton'sRandom Harvest, or his more famousLost Horizon: A Novel(BTW, in both cases, avoid the movies --terrible, terrible flops!)
__label__1	"Save Your Money!: As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
__label__1	"Don't bother: A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."
__label__1	AWFUL!: Fazzari massacres these compositions. He can't sing. Plain and simple. The band should be ashamed of themselves. Listen to the samples. They'll make you angry. Total garbage.
__label__1	"Don't!: It would have been more honest if these players had just presented this disc as their own interpretations of these fine songs. These songs do NOT sound as though the Beatles were doing them. Any creditable musicians with genuine love for the early Beatles sound and atmosphere could have done a better job recreating these numbers, if that was the desire. For a good comparison, listen to ""That Means A Lot"" done by Billy Sullivan (not half so well known as Vinny Fazzari), on his ""All American Popster"" album -- exquisite!"
__label__1	IT STINKS ON ICE.: Wavery-voiced pop icon Madonna and incomprehensible non-singer Banderas absolutely destroy this wonderful score. The orchestrations are hideous. Pass this one by, and get the Broadway version (a masterpiece) with LuPone(BRILLIANT!) and Patinkin.
__label__2	GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS: I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA. I HAVE BEEN A LIFE LONG FAN AND EVEN I WAS KINDA IFEY ABOUT HER DOING THIS BUT THIS IS A LADY MADE OF SHEER DETERMINATION TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT.
__label__1	The poorest of all the versions to date.: I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.
__label__2	Stuck in my head forever...thanks a lot!: I'm not any sort of expert of musicals but all I know is I really enjoyed this when it came out and years later I still find myself whistling Evita songs every other day. It is memorable music and this movie/soundtrack is done in a very entertaining way regardless of how faithful it is to the original. The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music. Plus unlike many soundtracks that skip songs this one is literally THE sound track to the musical. I pushed play on the CD once while the DVD was playing and it was synchronized.
__label__2	You must get this soundtrack: There are two soundtracks for this movie, get this one. Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but if you want to get the full expierience of an incredible soundtrack with even more incredible talent performing it, then this is an absoute must!
__label__2	"I surprisingly enjoyed it: I normally don't like this kind of music but I really enjoyed ""Evita!"" It was surprisingly good for me and it will be ""surprisingly good for you."""
__label__2	This album has everything a person could want in a cd!!!!!: This album has everything a person could want in a cd: beautiful singing,a great music score, and (since there was no dialog in the movie) a sense of story. Antonio Banderas is a great singer. His spanish accent makes him perfect for the part. And as for Madonna, how could anyone compare her with Patti LuPone. Madonna obviously has much more delicacy and a much sweeter voice than the Broadway Evita. If it were up to me I would give this cd 500 stars. This is my favorite cd and that is saying alot since I have over 800.
__label__1	"Lush but flawed: There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."
__label__2	Evita soundtrack: I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances.
__label__1	Buy another version. Any other version.: Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead.
__label__1	The worst EVITA ever: The motion picture soundtrack, yet alone the motion picture of EVITA, is terrible. Hollywood, as usual, took a wondeful piece of work (the hit musical EVITA) and butchered it to be their way. Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead
__label__1	"HORRIBLE: This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
__label__2	Just Marvelous: Wow, Madonna did such a wonderful job with this. I haven't heard any of the other recordings, but Madonna had real EMOTION in her voice. I have the single-cd copy, and I'm thinking about going and buying the double one, just because it's that good. I definitely reccommend this if you're into musicals. Even if you aren't a Madonna fan, it's worth it.
__label__2	Magnificent!: This cd is absolutely wonderful! Madonna is the best Evita out there! Compared to Patti LuPone and Julie Covington she is the only one who can actually sing! Unlike Mandy Patinki, Antonio Banderas brings emotion and power to his singing. His voice is strong but can also be soft when it should be. After listening to this cd, I am glad they did cut out certain lyrics and replaced them. Some of the lyrics from the old Evitas are too direct. Jonathan Pryce may not be the best singer on this cd, but at least his voice doesn't make you cover your ears every time he comes on. He fits the part very well if you knew anything about the real Evita and Juan Peron. Jimmy Nail is also a good singer, although unfortunately he is only in 3 tracks. This cd is absolutely gggrrreeeaaattt!!!! They tried and they were more than 100% succesful!!!
__label__1	Blue Color: I didn't like installing this printer at all. It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy, by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark. The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem, following the directions exactly, it crashed my entire system. It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors. Maybe it's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster. I also don't like the color quality. It reads color much darker than what's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint. I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark.
__label__1	Have not received my item in a month.: My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month.
__label__2	Good Buy: This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice.
__label__1	Magenta: This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from.
__label__1	Constant paper jams: I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price, but expected something that worked. EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper. I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results. If you do decide to buy, 1) ensure the store will accept returns, and 2) be prepared to pay return shipping.
__label__1	limitations of color printing: This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed.
__label__2	This is so useful: I have had my handbook for a few years and this book has helped me with a bunch of papers for college.
__label__2	Definitely Brief: I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database.
__label__1	Not pleased with Express delivery!: My review is not about the book. This is one of my textbooks I needed for my course and I was glad that Amazon had it in stock. However I chose to pay highest shiping amount to express delivery for next day, (which happens to be Saturday) so that I have time to review chapter before school started, it did not arrive that Saturday. What is purpose was next day delivery if you don't receive the product on time? I think I paid about $25 for one book when there was an option to receive Monday delivery for much less ($10, I think). The book arrived on Monday after my school started and I did not have a book to take to school. Amazon owes me money!
__label__1	"The same bootleg nonsence: First of all, let me say that I am a huge Wes fan! Not only is he one of my favorite guitarists, but one of my favorite composers as well. Everything Wes played was genius, including all the music on this CD. However, this release is not worth buying.This CD follows in the long tradition of Wes bootlegs of the March 27, 1965 concert in Paris. The songs are mistitled, the sound quality is poor; the personal are not listed, the date is not listed, the venue is not listed, and the booklet is non-informative. To make matters worse the song order has been rearranged to an awful order!If you are interested in obtaining a good version of this concert buy ""Quintessential Wes"" by Varese Records."
__label__1	Terrible: It came eith a hole, so from day 1 i couln't use it without a patch, and i had to buy another patch because this one didn't work either
__label__1	Came with a Leak: Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn...
__label__1	Used it once before it broke: I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1	Disappointment: I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money.
__label__1	SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON: The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.
__label__2	A great buy!: I love this air mattress! Very easy to set up and put away and very comfy to sleep on. I have slept on other air mattresses before and this is by far the best one I have ever slept on. The soft top makes it so you don't feel like you're sticking to it, but I put a blanket over it anyway for extra comfort. I have been recommending this one to all of my friends, I'm very happy with it!
__label__1	Doesn't hold air: I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor. I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box.
__label__1	If you buy this, good luck.: We purchased the Intex Inflatable twin bed with built in pump. After a few uses it started leaking air. By the middle of the night, it was down to about half full. So, being we are out of the 30 day return time frame, we are just out.If you buy this, good luck.
__label__1	Horrible product: Using this air bed was a nightmare to my husband. It is not firm and loses air easily. It lost half of the air in 30 minutes. When my husband got up from this bed in the morning, he was almost on the floor. He slept as a curve during the night, which really hurt his waist, which affect his movement. Definitely will return to Amazon today.
__label__1	Did not hold air. I have to return it!: This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air. I am very upset that in returning, I will not get full refund for this defective product! There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!
__label__1	Utter Garbage: Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State
__label__1	This is a horrible bed: I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay. I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive. It sat in an unoccupied room for one night- no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air. A serious amount air leaked out- it was visibly noticeable. I cannot imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it. This is a horrible product. It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep, I gave up. You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item. It was never slept on- period- and is unusable.
__label__1	Seams Came Apart After 5th Use: I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same.
__label__1	Disposable item; will not last past 6 months.: So I've had this product since July 2011, and it is now in the trash. The seams do not hold up and 2 have released, creating giant 'bubbles' in the mattress rendering it unusable. I paid nearly $50 for this back then, and only used it 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item.
__label__1	All of mine have not lasted long.: A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model.
__label__1	Would not inflate RETURNED: I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands.
__label__1	Terrible beds: I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped. They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem. 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced. I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand. They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again. So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again. I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them. I am terribly disappointed.
__label__1	Will not completely deflate: I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors...
__label__1	Waste of Money: I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.
__label__2	convenient twin airbed: First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed.
__label__1	It could be better: Currently, there are no wholes throughout the bed. But, for some reason when I wake up. The bed is already out of air. I only weigh 120lbs. I don't understand why it does that. Please save your money, when you start to have the same problem.
__label__1	One Was Good, So I Bought Another-Big Mistake: I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted. I ordered and received a second one which I have not yet used. Meanwhile, the first one has sprung a leak and is not usable. Big disappointment. No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals.
__label__2	Well made and great value!: We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors.
__label__2	Outstanding Bed: I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!
__label__1	Worst airbed ever - Don't buy: If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing.
__label__2	inflatable airbed: very happy with this electric pump inflatable airbed - understandable directions -very easy to inflate with electric pump - confortable to lie on especially withheadrest - easy to store with its own bag - I'm entirely satisfied with thisproduct from Amazon
__label__1	RETURNED IT!: We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed.
__label__1	Lasted a month: It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only.
__label__2	Easy to setup and comfortable: I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints.
__label__2	"I love this bed! carry it anywhere!: I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."
__label__1	"Huge disappointment: I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
__label__1	Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.: Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it.
__label__1	I couldn't find the leaks.: When it started leaking I couldn't find the leaks. First the top started leaking, later the bottom so now I have totally given up on it.It was comfortable before it started leaking.
__label__2	Nice: I have not completely set this item up yet, but thus far looks like a great mattress for extra sleeping accommodations. Is for my college-age son via family visits....
__label__2	Thank you for saving my back!!!: I ordered this air mattress because I have a bad back and was getting another procedure done and needed a place to recover. We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well. I can think of many reasons why this would be a purchase that is more than worth it for people of all ages (I am in my forties).
__label__1	Comfortable, but leaked the first night: it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night.
__label__2	Great buy!: This bed worked great for when I had company over. I needed something that was easy and compact so I can store it when it's not needed. I like having the pump built in because there's no chasing the thing around when you need to use the bed again.
__label__1	Didn't Last: I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.
__label__2	Perfect for grandchildren: We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it.
__label__2	Guests love it.: Inflates fast. Nice shape when inflated stores well. Guest are getting a good nights rest. Would reorder if we need more.
__label__2	Comfortable: Is comfortable to sleep on,it fills up fast and easy. Only thing really don't like is the rubber smell it has when u first open it but little by little it goes away. I recommend it 100%.
__label__2	quality: I liked this, my guests said it was comfortable. It stayed inflated for the 7 days of guests and no one complained about it.
__label__2	Good buy: I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
__label__1	Not Happy: I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night. I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak. If it was in a seam it was under warranty. I tried to find the leak, but was unable. I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak. I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone!
__label__2	"Not all air beds are created equal: I purchased the Intex airbed to replace an Aerobed that our cats ""loved"" too much during a guest visit. Comfort wise, the Intex wins hands down-supportive yet comfortable as well. Convenience wise, it inflates a little slower than our old Aerobed (albeit, there is more to inflate) yet it takes up less room when rolled and stored in the sack that comes with it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is VERY high, so a restless sleeper can fall off pretty easily."
__label__2	air mattress: So far so good....holds the air and prefect for a sleep over at aunties's house!Easy set up,built in pupmp, easy put away....nice carrying bag also.So far worth the money, Thank you.
__label__2	Great Airbed: I looked at several airbeds before buying this one. I looked at several name brands, I was not familiar with Intex so I checked the reviews and am glad I did. Fast delivery, easy set up (a must for me) and a very sturdy product. We are completely satisfied with this bed. The built in pump is easy to use and works perfectly. We bought the twin due to space but intend to buy a larger bed to have on hand.
__label__1	huge LUMP after a few uses...: i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!
__label__2	Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I looked around before buying an airbed. Saw many options and compare. Many different comments that confused me. But decided to buy this one due to the price and the electric pump. Excellente product, inflates in just 2-3 minutes and last all night long. Easy to store in the morning. 5 star product.
__label__2	Fast, Easy, Comfortable, Great for Guest: Fast Blow-up, Easy to handle, Comfortable, Not too big & not too small - great for Guests. Only 4 out of 5 because it looses about 15% of the air originally put in within 2 days. I still recommend this product to anybody!
__label__2	Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: The Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump is a amazing purchase comparing price and quality.
__label__1	sucks: leaks after leaks after leaks. i have patched them with super glue and bike patches and they just dont seem to stop comming. i am tired of patching them. dont ever buy a air mattress. just fork out the cash for a good mattress.
__label__1	air bed: Great product for my visiting 3 1/2 year old grand daughter! Stays inflated well.Fair price! Easy to inflate and deflate!
__label__1	on website it says twin but actual size is single.: i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.
__label__1	not the one I ordered: I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product...
__label__2	Intex Airbed: These are only meant for use as temporary or guest bedding, but I've been in a situation where I am using this item daily as my bed for over a month now. I am a large person. It has held up beautifully. I add air maybe once every 7-10 days. The flocked top is great, holding sheets in place. It is so comfortable, my back and general body pain has improved dramatically since using it! I suspect that when my permanent bed arrives, this little bed will serve long and well as guest bedding.
__label__2	Great value: I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product.
__label__2	"Great Air Mattress: For the price, it can't be beat. It's very comfortable. I ordered two so I'd have one as a backup in case one sprung a leak. I had no problems with the quality of either, although it is about 6-8"" more narrow than a standard twin so twin fitted sheets are too big."
__label__2	Not good enough, 3 stars - got a good replacement, now 4 stars: Needs to be pumped up at least twice in the night. High rise makes it easy for older people to use.UPDATE:Amazon was outstanding. I wrote saying that the bed was leaking too much to be comfortable.. an immediate replacemnt was sent and i printed out a free shipping label online.The new bed is perfect.. three kids slept on it together and they were fast asleep when i checked later.I left the airbed out next two days and no air had leaked yet.I was lucky I think to have got a good piece.Thank you Amazon.
__label__1	losing air already!: We used the airbed for one guest (my very careful mother-in-law) over the holidays and it was fine. My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since. I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it.
__label__1	This thing SUCKS! I went through 3 of them!!! Waste of money. Do NOT buy this: I went through three of these, neither one of them would maintain the air pressure and would slowly deflate. This occurred within 2 uses for each of the 3 mattresses i had. I considered maybe the person sleeping on it was too heavy, but alas, the person is 210 pounds and the weight limit is 300, so that wasnt it. I thought maybe it was punctured, but if it was the person would have awoken on the floor instead of on a supper jeloutnous rubber blob, so that was not it either. What conclusion left is there- this thing sucks and doesnt maintain the air.
__label__1	Only good for a couple of use: I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there.
__label__2	Excellent bed and for the price. Sets up quickly.: I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.
__label__1	worthless: I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
__label__1	Not good: It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress.
__label__1	3 weeks and heard a big boom!: Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!
__label__2	So far so good....: My brother was coming to stay for a week in our apartment, so I needed something that would not be totally uncomfortable for him to sleep on 5 nights in a row. This air mattress did the job. It did a nice job of staying inflated throughout the week. My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely). But overall, it held air and that's what we needed it to do.
__label__2	Perfect for me: I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
__label__2	Comfortable, but a little smaller then some.: I like a firm bed and found that I needed to physically pump in the additional air pressure. There is that option along with the electric/fill, deflate which is very helpful. I took it camping for five nights and though I topped it off before bed every night, it didn't deflate enough for me to notice in the morning.
__label__2	Worth the money.: Needed place for kids to sleep while visiting grandma and now they argue over who gets to sleep on the air mattress. Both think it's more comfy than their bed at home.Would have given 5 stars, but the bag it comes with to put it in is worthless, no chance of ever getting it in there again.
__label__1	"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this: I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
__label__2	"Great convience for the price!!!!: Product arrived on time, (a little early actually---which is a good thing, :-); intact, & in excellent condition. This bed includes an ""in mattress inflation motorized pump"" that makes for ease of use, and much quieter inflation application in comparison to external pump air mattresses. It is comfortable, and an extremely good value for the price!!! Will purchase this product again!!!"
__label__2	"item mislabeled: This is a good product. I use it nightly.It is 36"" in width, not 40"" as marked onthe box. This makes it tend to roll moreeasily. I had to frame and tie it to makeit stable."
__label__1	A total dud: Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future.
__label__2	okay for the price: I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep.
__label__1	"Faulty advertising: At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back."
__label__1	Angry: I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend.
__label__1	Crappy Air bed: Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!
__label__1	Night on the Floor: The bed arrived much sooner than I expected, and I inflated it for w few minutes before I took it on my retreat. Imagine my surprize at having it deflate within an hour of getting is set up in my room. I ended up sleeping on the floor that night.We'll see how the return process goes. I'm headed out to buy an air mattress locally.
__label__1	do you hear air?: This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality.
__label__1	Comfortable... if not for the deflation.: I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money.
__label__1	Was hopeful, but . . .: I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem.
__label__1	I so wanted to love this item: Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that.
__label__2	Comfortable: We took this bed camping, and it was very comfortable to sleep on. It did lose some air overnight, so we just reinflated before going to bed. Great mattress for the price!
__label__2	Intex Twin Airbed: The two beds arrived quicker than I expected. They are very comfortable and blow up quickly. Getting all the air out to put it in its duffel bag took a little work but it fit. Easy to travel with when visiting friends.
__label__2	Nice Bed: Seems to be a nicely designed and manufactured air bed. We've used it for guests a few times, and are pleased with it.
__label__2	Very convenient and easy: I bought this to stay in my daughters dorm room where space is limited and it worked great. Don't need a pump its all built in. Stayed 5 nights and added air with the flick of a switch, I like it very firm. Would buy another if needed.
__label__1	bubble bed: This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
__label__1	Not as good as Aero Beds..... was disappointed: It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and isn't as comfortable as it could be. For the price and the function is okay, the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed.
__label__1	Low cost defective product: This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice.
__label__2	Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative!: I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers.
__label__1	bed leaked on first use: I ordered for use when company came-my niece slept on this once and ended up on the floor after one night. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
__label__1	"Doesn't Last: We received the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump on September 10th 2008. It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder. Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a ""traditional"" mattress. The first 2 months it worked great. She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain. The next few months we had to pump it up every other day, but she still was in less pain. Now today, April 11th 2009, just 7 months later she can't even sleep on it. Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat. Our daughter is now sleeping on couch cushions until we can find a new bed. Don't waste your money on this bed! Find ANY OTHER airbed, you'll be much happier."
__label__1	Leaked striaght frpm the box: I chose this twin air mattres becaue of the reviews and brand, good quality. I bought it about 2 months ago for a weekend of Holiness, it just had a hole when i aired it up. Threw it in the trash terrible product.
__label__2	"Intex air mattress: Used for a temporary bed when visiting relatives. Easy to set up and store. Inflates very quickly and is comfortable. I only used it three times and if it lasts a year, I'll be a happy ""camper""."
__label__2	Comfortable but still not perfect: I have purchased this matress 3 weeks ago. The price is pretty affordable, and it actually looks like a normal bed. At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over. But overall it is good substitution if you need a temporary bed.
__label__2	Intex Inflatable Twin Bed: I've only had it a little bit however many words have been written pro and con about this product so I to shall endeavor to provide you with some useful information.1st it is an airbed and it doesn't take kindly to claws of many kinds or sharp point objects. 2nd it is a portable airbed... the valve isn't a perfect seal as with any air mattress or bed so expect to use the built in pump every now and then as a result of seepage .. 3rd comfort just pump it up or deflate to personal comfort level. 4th the price is relatively low cost. 5th Seems to be of decent quality aired up right out of the box and has held the pressure with no major leaks.
__label__1	"Sized Incorrectly: I purchased 2 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Beds due to the size specifications of 40 X 80 X 18 1/2"". They were to be used by my >6 ft. tall family members when visiting. I was extremely disappointed when we inflated the 1st bed - which BARELY measured 32 X 70 X 16. I sent a letter to the supplier, CMS WorldWide Sales, explaining my dissatisfaction & was told to send pictures & measurements (which I did) and they would [quote]...""Once you had provided us the information we had requested, we will be glad to forward you the return shipping labels.""This was months ago, and to date I still have 2 Intex Pillow Rest Beds (the 2nd box was never even opened!) that are no where near the specs stated on the packaging.I will NEVER order anything from the CMS WorldWide Sales supplier again."
__label__1	decent for price, only one fall back so far: I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and used it for the first time last night. It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in.
__label__1	"misgivings: The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
__label__2	Great Bed @ Great Price...: I purchased this airbed because I wanted to sleep in the same room as my newborn. Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy. Great Buy!
__label__1	not 80in in length: I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back.
__label__1	Went flat in the middle of the first night.: This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day.
__label__2	A little hard to fold back up but seems great otherwise: I'm arranging a getaway weekend in hotel, so I bought a bunch of these. I tried one first and it seemed nice and working as specified. The only thing is that it's tough folding and putting it back into it's bag.
__label__1	Garbage: Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.
__label__2	Awesome Air Bed: This is used for when my older son has friends stay over night. It's easy to set up, and comfortable. Does the job flawlessly.
__label__2	Great: This really worked out well for me! It lost a little air but that is to be expected. I use this during the holidays when extra people are visiting.
__label__2	It must be good...: I tried it out and fell asleep on it. No noticeable leakage overnight. It seems to me like a good buy.
__label__1	One Strike: The product deflated during the night. We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air. I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress. I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item. Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated.
__label__1	No-Go,sorry: Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster.
__label__2	comfortable kids bed: My grandson loved sleeping on this blow up bed, he said it was so comfortable. It's a great idea if you need xtra guest beds, because it deflates and stores so easily. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes to inflate.I would recommend this product highly.
__label__1	Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months: I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with.
__label__2	Good for its value: I bought the bed with the idea of using it during one week while my father was visiting. It fulfilled its purpose perfectly. It's comfortable, it inflates and deflates very quickly and it's pretty high. There are two reasons why I am not giving it a 5-star score: a) I used sheets and still, when I woke up, my back was sweating. I guess that it is a problem with all these beds that are made of plastic, but... that is a drawback. b) I haven't been able to fold it and fit it in the bag again, it's almost impossible.Anyway, overall, it's a great deal for its price. I would absolutely recommend it and the problems I pointed out are probably a problem in all air beds.
__label__2	Very Comfortable: The bed is nice and soft and double thick. The auto pump is easy to use and works pretty well with new batteries. The vacuum drain does ok but when down to the base have to help it by rolling it at the end. Folding it isn't to hard and package size isn't to big so easy to store. Bed lines fit ok on it but get good one so they squeeze tight so they hang on. But for the money is a great buy I shopped around a lot target, walmart, dicks, Meijer, sears, kmart, ect. So very good buy if you want one for camping or a guest bed.
__label__2	Good!!: I like this product. The power code is nicely kept in the unit so I do not have to worry about losing the power code. Kids love it when their friends come for sleep over. Quick and easy to use.
__label__1	Wont hold air after 32 days since online purchase thru amazon: Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet.
__label__1	No good.: This product was received having a slow leak ..box was received damaged. .. Daughter went to bed at morning we discovered her in the middle (sinked).... I would not recommend......
__label__1	"Beware of the dimensions: I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
__label__2	INTEX air bed: The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise.
__label__2	Great: This bed is great, compact and comfortable. We've had guests who use it ask us where we got it because they want to buy it too.
__label__2	Intex Pillow Rest Airbed: This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us.
__label__1	It doesn't stay firm even overnight.: It doesn't stay firm even overnight. The motor burned out after a while. I bought a Coleman. . . .
__label__1	Short Product Life: This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer.
__label__1	"Terrible product and customer service: I purchased three of these and within 1-2 months, ALL three of them ""broke"". The seams on two of the beds broke, leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart..Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for. After contacting the company and starting the refund process, I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I wouldn't be able to receive a refund. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yes, the beds are $35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but can't believe how cheaply they are made. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck!"
__label__1	"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew: Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."
__label__1	slow leaking: Air mattress: Looks good, works but requires frequent running of pump. Appears to lose air through the built-in pump. Should have returned the mattress but need the bed for visitor. Probable would not buy with built-in pump in future.
__label__1	doesn't leak but uncomfortable to sleep on: I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!
__label__2	Very satisfied!!!!!!!!: I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased.
__label__2	Comfortable, but needs insulation from cold: We purchased 2 of these for guests' use and they are quite comfortable. The pumps work relatively quickly and quietly, and allow for good firmness in the mattress. They also held air well and needed little additions over 2 weeks' time.Our only drawback was that the air doesn't provide insulation from cooler ambient air. We keep our home cooler at night, and a guest found it necessary to cover the mattress with a heavy blanket to insulate properly from the coolness. I would recommend a mattress pad or foam topper when using this to provide some extra warmth.
__label__1	Not Durable: Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL
__label__2	This product is great.: This bed is great. I use it everyday for my little.So far its still inflated and very comfortable.Recommend it for anyone who has a guess or personal use.I especially like the pump, how its connected to the bed andcan store-it inside the bed.
__label__1	Cheap Not worth your money: I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole.
__label__2	Good Air Mattress: Very good air mattress, have had many friends come and stay on it and it hasn't lost much air. Would recommend it if you need an air mattress for visitors.
__label__1	Worst Air Bed Ever.: This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton
__label__2	Nice rest: Really nice portable bed, I don't wanna back sleeping in a regular bed!!!. I highly recommend this item for everybody who is looking for a good bed to be sleeping like a baby.
__label__2	I would definatly buy this again: The bed was comfortable and filled easily. It's only draw back was that did not fit all the way back into the carring box.
__label__1	Leaked: We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box.
__label__1	Worst purchase ever.: This was the worst product I ever bought. It held up only about 40 days and then, got more inflated on one side then the other. Of course ended in the trash. I have no car, so was very hard for me to return the item, and go to the post office. Waste of money. Do not order from this company ever. BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Bad product: This is not worth the price. Used it once and had to re-inflate it five times. Does not hold air. A piece of junk.
__label__1	Not satisfied: The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates.
__label__2	Good value, works as advertised: I bought this air bed to accommodate a 120 lb. guest who used it for five days. The initial fill took only a few minutes. It was really convenient. It needed only 5-10 seconds of re-inflation after 3 days to make up for lost air. Even so, we weren't sure if the bed had lost any air at all. This mattress has remained inflated for 3 weeks now without losing air as far as I can tell. I'm happy with my purchase -- it does its job.
__label__1	This bed will not retain air.: It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item
__label__2	Twin Airbed w/built-in electric pump: This product worked just as advertised. Inflated in less than 3 minutes, and after testing for 2 weeks, remains inflated with just minor refill of air required. Great value for the price. Highly recommended.
__label__2	TERRIFIC Air Mattress!: I inflated this air bed for a guest who reported how comfortable it was. The twin fitted sheet worked great and didn't slip around with the flannel surface. The installed inflation/deflation pump also worked great and was fast. My guest used the air bed for an entire week, and it never lost air or got soft. My only criticism is that the static on the rubber underside did pick up some loose dirt and dog hair that was on the hardwood floor where I placed the bed.
__label__1	Not available.: I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex.
__label__2	Worth the price!: I move between places a lot and hence can't afford to buy permanent bed frames and mattresses. I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!
__label__2	Very Comfortable - Convenient Build in pump: Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!
__label__1	Leaky unit: I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on. The bed was easy to fill and evacuate, but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day. I couldn't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on.
__label__1	customer service is dead: every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
__label__1	Just like all the other airbeds: I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night.
__label__1	Lasted one month of everyday use: I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that couldn't be patched due to the fabric. It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it.
__label__1	Never buy this product it's a wast of money: HI All,Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it's a wast of time.........leacking after a week. fix that than find another leaking...till u trash it..and get rid of it..i have the pic and i paid for it $60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo.
__label__2	Extra Bed: Love it! When the boys come home and bring their friends, everyone has a bed!!! They roll up small and tight for easy storage. Also, they are very comfortable. I will even inflate one so I can enjoy sleeping by the warm fire on very cold nights.
__label__1	Air Mattress works great: We loved the internal pump which also will pump the air out. It is so fast and the mattress itself gives a good night's sleep.
__label__2	Intex Pillow Rest Twin AirBed: This bed was purchased as a spare bed for short time visitors as we are limited in space in our Park Model RV. We needed someting that didn't take up much room to store and yet was comfortable enough so that as person could get a decent nights sleep on it. After reading all the reviews I could find, I deduced that some of these beds were faulty (like all things) and that they tended to deflate overnight, but, that most were fine. Our bed has met all of our expectations and is fine, comfortable and holds the air. I would highly recommend this product!!
__label__2	BEST AIR MATTRESS EVER!: This bed is awesome, perfect size, pump works great just a bit noisy like a vaccuum cleaner, ordered it on friday got monday the next week even though i used standard shipping (3-5 business days).
__label__2	Great airbed!: Really great airbed, comfortable, easy to inflate, portable. Seems to deflate rather quickly but only takes 5 seconds to refill.
__label__2	Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I received this air bed over two months ago and we love it. I bought it for my granddaughter to sleep on and it's the easiest thing to set up and take down to put away. I put a mattress pad on under the sheets and she says she would rather sleep on the air bed than her regular bed because it that comfortable. No leaks so far. I'm very happy with this purchase.
__label__1	Intext Pillow Rest Twin Airbe: I was so excited when I received this air bed, but after sleeping on it on the first night, things changed. Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm. There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump
__label__2	"GREAT BED, GREAT PRICE: THIS AIR BED IS GREAT! I HAD PREVIOUSLY PAID WAY MORE FOR THE ""A--O"" BRAND, BUT THIS ONE IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE. I AM A GAL WITH A ""MATURE"" FIGURE, AND IT (TWIN) ONLY LOST A LITTLE AIR. WITH THE ELECTRIC PUMP, NO WORRIES! JUST A HINT FOR SOME OF YOU WITH BAD KNEES LIKE I HAVE....I PLACED TWO CAMP COTS SIDE BY SIDE AND LAID THE MATTRESS ON TOP. PERFECT FOR THESE TIRED OLD KNESS AND BODY TO GET UP AND OFF OF. KUDOS ON THIS AIR BED!"
__label__1	LEAKED FIRST DAY FOR MY GUEST: IT HAD A LEAK FROM DAY ONE. RETURN AND EXCHANGE PROCESS WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH. STILL WAITING ON THE NEW ONE
__label__2	Super airbed: Ordered two and tested them out: one had a bad pump but the return was easy.These airbeds are super cheap and great. Everyone who has slept on them says they are extremely comfortable. They hold the air well. I recommend them very highly
__label__1	Low Quality: Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short.
__label__2	blow up bed: I purchased for my guest room for overnight stays for family members.this holds up very well especially for grandchildren
__label__1	not reccomended: Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months.
__label__2	Intex Pillow rest Twin: I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product
__label__2	Good price, good night.: Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me.
__label__1	"Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a ""strobe"" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck."
__label__2	Good kids book!: We just got this book and again it is great. Diane Layton does a great job speaking to little ones about something so very serious and making it understandable. I have loved everyone of her books that we have received. They are wonderful, I wish there were more books like these!
__label__2	Just listen to Julis's letters!: I had a old LP of this recording. I got this because I had been blown off by his masterpiece, Second contribution. Just try Julia's letters. You will be surprised. Strongly recommended. BTW, did he know he looked like Jesus?
__label__2	Street Index Fine Print: The street index is hard to read for the over forty crowd. If the font size was 12, it would have been much easier to read.
__label__1	Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses!: Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page.
__label__1	"Nesmith goes too far: Carrying on from the mostly instrumental albums of ""The Prison"" & ""The Garden"", we get ""Rays"".Which is nowhere as strong as these albums, with Nez laying on the Synths, giving a slight Queen from the 80's feel (which nobody wants to hear).He also creates a horn section using the synths, which just sounds cheap & tacky.With ""Prison"" & ""Garden"" you hear richly textured & ambitious soundscapes, but ""Rays"" is to low-fi (which I don't have a problem with), it just doesn't work with such a complete piece of work.This is the only weak Nesmith album, so I suggest you purchase the rest of his back catalogue before arriving at this (low) point."
__label__1	"Got ""Burnt"" By Rays: This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
__label__2	good and unique music: I heard some long-time fans of Michael Nesmith were confused. You'll listen to Michael's new sound.
__label__2	Best Lan Case for full size mobo: Excellent case! It comes in handy once a month for lan partys due to the carrying harness. Not to mention the weight will not break your back compared to other cases.I have owned SFF (Small Form Factor) machines in the past but I have to admit nothing beats the cooling and hardware upgrade potential of the Antec Super Lanboy.
__label__2	"One of the very best.....: This is one of the very best ""rockumentaries"" ever! I loved the whole thing, especially the interviews....especially the ones with the ultra-talented producer/singer/song writer/pianist John Simon-my friend. You might consider checking out John's own recordings."
__label__2	"A great documentary of one of the best albums ever: Any fan of the Band's music would get a lot out of seeing this documentary, which reveaks the creative process that went into their two masterworks, ""Music From Big Pink"" and ""The Band"". Band"" the story of Music from Big Pink is also covered here. Great interviews and stories from producer/engineer Joe Simon, and band members Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as well as a fitting obit to Richard Manuel."
__label__2	Great documentary on a great album.: I've always like VH-1's Classic Albums series and this episode doesn't disappoint. Great interviews with Robbie, Levon, and other band members (Including Rick Danko, who died last December). I love how they broke down Rag Momma Rag and Rockin' Chair into it's separate parts. A must for all Band Fans.
__label__2	"THE BAND: THE BROWN ALBUM: When the ""Classic"" series of videos came out, I could only wish for anything on The Band. The ""Brown Album"" or their 2nd album is highlighted here in story and song. The interviews are well worth the price of admission. The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top 10 favorites of many other music artists. Watching Garth Hudson at the keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon, is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music in the late 60's to mid 70's. This was probably their best effort of them all and to have it chronicled here is great. I have both the VHS & DVD versions. Since then I purchased Live at the New Orleans JazzFest."
__label__2	Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History: This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD.
__label__2	A must for fans of The Band: This is a terrific video - especially if you are a fan of The Band.I never realized how great Richard Manual was until I saw this video.
__label__1	The Band: Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. I will probably play it three or four times and then dispose of it.
__label__1	Blah Blah Blah.......: Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon.
__label__1	You're Kidding!: I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill
__label__2	The Naturalist's Guide: This book is literally a Naturalist's guide. I can't believe there are not more 5 star ratings of this book. As an arborist, birder, and wildlife biologist born in the piedmont I recommend this book.
__label__1	BROKE after a short time, not truly waterproof, way too large, and smells like rubber: This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast.
__label__1	Terrible: After repeated washings, it still smelled like a toxic plastic and who wants to put toxic plastic inside their body. Also, it didn't do the job. So I wasted my money and had to throw it away.
__label__1	"Great power, not great shape: The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the ""head"" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better. And I also think it's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes (or however you spell it)."
__label__1	way too big: This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable.
__label__1	ridiculous: I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~
__label__1	Help!: Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!
__label__1	Not waterproof!: It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it.
__label__2	Easy Climax: I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever.
__label__1	PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE: WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!
__label__1	Doesnt work: First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
__label__1	"Yuck: This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it ""air out,"" all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, ""Ewww, what's that smell."" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage."
__label__1	A Little Too Much: I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me.
__label__1	well: i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny. its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around. but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast. other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better. just goes to show bigger isnt better always. needs more power
__label__1	"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible!: First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."
__label__1	Beware-Can't return if defective as this one is!!!!!!!: This product would not even turn on once batteries were installed! It also has a terrible chemical odor which would probably cause most health conscious people not to risk actually using it anyway!Please be aware you cannot return so order at your own risk!
__label__1	Defective/No Return: When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.
__label__1	Doesn't work: I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing...
__label__1	doesnt work: Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
__label__1	So Disappointing!: I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again.
__label__1	No go: I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least.
__label__2	Excellent: First rabbit and it works amazingly. It does things that I never expected it to do. I would definitely by another one if something ever happened to this one.
__label__1	didn't even work: Out of the box it didn't even work. Whats worse there isn't an easy way to return it. I'm having to email amazon and hope for an exchange within a week.?
__label__2	Okay.....: I think the rabbit part is kind of bothersome and I thought the actual shaft would vibrate not just the rabbit. WEIRD.
__label__2	BREATH TAKING!!!: My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas, i have to say at first (without using it) i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing. my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you'll have that lol. Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol
__label__2	To Infinity and beyond!!!: This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too. Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders!!!I never climaxed so quickly.I don't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them..boy watch out ;) I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far.
__label__1	I didn't think it was that good.: Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
__label__1	broke one first use: First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy
__label__1	DISAPOINTED: I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
__label__1	"Too Noisy: Other reviews state this item is very quiet. Mine makes a very loud grinding noise. If the windows were open, I think the neighbors would hear it. The noise is totally distracting, thus I cannot use this product. If it was quiet as stated by others, I think I might be very satisfied with it. Did I get a ""lemon?"""
__label__1	Very Cheap: I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer.
__label__1	Totally Dissapointed! Like a bad Lover!: I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and haven't gotten a decent orgasm. This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell. I should saved my money! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful. The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me..
__label__1	Loved it - till we got it wet!: It is NOT NOT NOT WATERPROOF! Loved it, till we tried it in the tub. Worked for 4 seconds, then stopped. VERY DISAPPOINTED....
__label__1	Smells TOXIC and awful: This smells like paint thinner or something. It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else, and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory. Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink, I have no idea if it is save. Who knows what's in/on this thing and I certainly wouldn't want to put it in my body...it could be leaching chemicals. Cancer comes to mind. I had to throw it away. Total waste. Don't buy it, find another supplier!
__label__1	"Can't use it, can't return it.: I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says ""for novelty only"" which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people."
__label__1	Large and Hard!: Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again.
__label__2	"Great Quality Toy: This is great, wife loves it. We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and ""melt"". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever."
__label__1	Too Weak/Gentle: Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying.
__label__2	hubby vs wife: shipped fast good price good explanation of the detail and all other great aspects of this item...would tell friends about
__label__1	Not for me: It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money...
__label__1	one hit wonder: I tried this product. It broke during my first use. Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they'd send a new one. It's been a month and I haven't received anything. I'm over this company, Joy Hollywood. Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful. I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work. or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON.
__label__2	WOW!!: This product definitely does what is said to do. I haven't had any problems with it and its not too thick and the power is great.
__label__1	Horrible!: I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. I got it in the mail, put batteries in it, and... it wouldn't turn on. I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this, as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue. I really hope I can return it. Don't waste your money- if you want a rabbit, you might as well buy a real good quality one so you don't waste your money like I did.
__label__2	A quiet ride.: I was pretty surprised at how girthy it was when I opened the package. It is made with quality materials. There was the usual strong odor that tends to come along with new toys. But once soaped up nicely it seems much better. I feel lube is nessecary as a companion with this toy. Which can be a downfall at times. But the fact that it operates very smooth And quiet makes up for this. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and this brand. I love the fact that the batteries are kept in a tray that makes it super easy to keep them together and ready to go in between uses. Great price, good investment, great pleasure :)
__label__1	Great Transaction!!!: Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,
__label__1	Not a good vibrator: I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.
__label__1	NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE: This is TERRIBLE. I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken. It is absolutely NOT waterproof. Do NOT waste your money.
__label__1	Disappointed: I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else
__label__1	Awful: I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic.
__label__1	California Exotics jack rabbit: Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..
__label__1	Not waterproof: I only used it a couple of times, a tiny bit of water leaked into the battery compartment and now it is rusted and won't turn on.
__label__2	sooo biggggg: I had mixed reviews of this product. It most definitely got the job done, and fast! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes. Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times, but other than that it is a GREAT product.
__label__2	"Great after positioned right!: I got this today. As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out. I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right. Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven. I had the big ""O"" in a minute (probably under) and it was so intense I was shaking. The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right. I don't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy wouldn't work after. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy. My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is."
__label__2	Seems to be good!: This seems to be good so far only used it once. I really thought that the shaft vibrated but it does not. Love the bullet in the rabbit ears... so far so good!
__label__1	Nothing: Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money
__label__1	Disappointing: Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money.
__label__1	disappointed: I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response.
__label__2	wow: Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised, fast deliver an great service, thanks
__label__1	Ouch!: The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.
__label__1	Jack Rabbit: The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work. Also the item is non returnable so I can't even return it and get a new one. ):
__label__2	Outstanding in and out of water: My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!
__label__1	The worst ever: This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash.
__label__2	Awesome once you find your rhythym!: I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). I am pretty much a nontoy user, but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price, I was hooked! It came on time in very discreet packaging (Thank you Lord!). A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside, completely sealed. I don't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I wasn't expecting it to be so HUGE. I took it slow, and was able to use it after a little coaxing. A little painful, but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING. Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So, it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced, but it's definitely worth it!
__label__1	Reviews are so off--terrible!: I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money.
__label__2	Works like a charm: For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL.
__label__1	"False Advertising: The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has ""alternate views"" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!"
__label__1	Not waterproof!: This thing is awful! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. I've dried it, replaced the batteries and it still won't work. I only used it 2 times. This is a total waste of money!
__label__2	Holy Crap!!!: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.
__label__1	Yet another disappointed customer: Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done.
__label__1	jams: LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use.
__label__1	Ehh.: It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product.
__label__1	Pretty large: Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration. All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting. Smaller would be better.
__label__1	"Poor quality: I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough."
__label__2	SUPERB: This toy took a little getting use to. But after a few times playing with it I was amazing. I wish there were more options for the speed & vibration but It makes me quite happy & I'm not always easy to please. ;-)
__label__2	Wife loves this little guy: This is our 2nd one of these. The first one lasted about 2 yrs and my wife was very sad about its passing. But the 2nd is just as satisfying for her as the 1st. Wonderful item : )
__label__1	"Not pelased: I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."
__label__1	Broken Item: Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.
__label__1	"Looking For Similar to Better Shower Companion: Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the ""off"" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer."
__label__1	Broken: I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money.
__label__1	Breaks easily!: I have only had this product for three months, and after a month I was having problems with this product. I have given up on this vibe, and I do not recommend buying this product. Spend the extra money on something that will actually last!
__label__1	Looked good, didn't work: This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time.
__label__1	Works really well right up until it doesn't: It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator.
__label__1	Very disappointed: I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it.
__label__1	NO WAY!: This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
__label__2	Awesome Product: I bought this for my fiancé for during foreplay it was the best thing I bought her! She loves it it makes her go wild she has gets so horny while I use it on her and it makes sex a million times better! She goes crazy while I pleasure her with this vibrator! Than durig sex she is amazing! It was definatly a great added touch to our sex life! If any guys Re lookin to please there women to the max and than have crazy sex afterwords, buy this product cause you will have an expierance of a life time! Awesome product and work amazing! And this is the best price I found on the Internet! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon! Good luck
__label__1	BORING!: I have enjoyed all the Fleetwood Mac albums and thought this video would provide excellent sound tracks from their album Rumors. Unfortunately, both me and my guests were extremely disappointed by boring commentary mixed in with partial sound tracks..... A book would have been more entertaining.
__label__1	"YOU DON'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS: This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this ""Album"" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back."
__label__1	Misleading.: Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans.
__label__1	Zero Stars: Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video.
__label__1	"A ""Box of Chocolates"": I'm really upset with myself for not more closely reading the reviews that said there wasn't music, just talking about the songs. I like the Fleetwood Mac, but not personally. I thought I was buying a concert performance with commentary. If you don't get a preview, you don't know what you'll get."
__label__1	A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!: THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO.
__label__2	"Very satisfying and informative.: An honest and articulate accounting of the year that produced one of the finest pop albums ever made.As a musician, I was thrilled by the segments that take place in the studio with the original master tapes, breaking down the arrangements, revealing the extraordinary harmony singing, and exposing unused material.As a fan, I was moved by the almost incredible story of two couples breaking up but choosing to continue their work together. It seems that there could have been no ""Rumours"" without the angst that fueled the songs.Bravo to the producers of the ""Classic Albums"" series."
__label__1	Don't be fooled this is just a documental: No one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion.
__label__1	Buy something else: The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. I thought it was them in concert. Too much talking
__label__1	"eBay, here I come!: Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"
__label__1	Fleetwood Mac Rumours: If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video.
__label__1	Confused: I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music.
__label__2	Rumours DVD: The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed.
__label__1	"disapointed after watching ""The Dance"": Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."
__label__1	It's just a nice to OK documentary: It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety.
__label__2	entertaining but could have been better: If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history.
__label__2	"Absolutely wonderful!: I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn't wear out!), it should be obvious that I'm ecstatic about the music. Now, I've added this wonderful inside look to my collection. If you're a Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" fan, this is the best gift you could receive from someone! Every Fleetwood Mac fan will love this on their shelf to replay at will. Phenomenal!"
__label__1	too frustrating for the price: Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing.
__label__2	So easy: I had no problem setting times and days for the unit to run it is so easy, I have also purchased 2 of the double outlet timers of the same make so that did make easy for me to set the single timer. Fitting to the tap is easy and the unit does exactly what I wanted it for. I would recommend this make of timer to anybody for ease of setting and for how it runs.
__label__2	It's all good!: This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs
__label__2	Solid water timer: I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong.
__label__1	Not recommended: Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week.
__label__1	1. Something Good: I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon.
__label__1	uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it.
__label__2	If I was stranded on a desert island with one album...: If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions.
__label__2	Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.
__label__1	Like the sprial binding, not much else: The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on.
__label__1	"Garbage.: Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers. ""plug and play"" install did not work. downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC. attempted to contact vendor,no email was available, only a long distance phone number. Threw it in the trash."
__label__2	Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed.
__label__1	"Paper on ""hand decorated"" box looks cheap: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be ""exotic"" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper."
__label__2	Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation: Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author.
__label__1	"My First Negative Review -- Ever: Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
__label__2	One of the best: I enjoyed this book tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a story that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf.
__label__2	Good Book: I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese.
__label__1	Not what you think....: This item is not what you think it is. This video is only about the war, not on what horrors were done to the people in the camps. Except for history buffs and teachers, this would not be a good video just for viewing pleasure.
__label__2	George Elliot's Romola: In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending.
__label__2	everything you expect from George Eliot: Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites.
__label__1	Ripped Off: Not worth the money at all. None of the music is mixed togeather, like by a DJ. Most of the songs are not by the original artists! I wish I had never purchased this order, and will never again purchase such an items without being able to hear all of the songs. One last thought,,I was an 80's nightcluber,,, some of the songs I never, ever heard of and they are not good what so ever, just fill in songs.
__label__1	"Entire CS3 family crashes: Effects isn't the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes. We are having issues with all of them. Photoshop which doesn't normally import huge files is now crashing our Mac G4. I'm running Sony's Vegas Video at home which has quite a few ""effects"" add-ons available from other vendors. If Adobe doesn't straighten this out maybe Sony will take up the slack."
__label__1	Patti Page attempts to sing jazz...: Unfortionately Miss Patti Page doesn't have the talent or chops to pull off a jazz session. Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying. Stay awa yfrom this and just go out and buy any CD by Anita O'Day or June Christy, but for Heaven Sake's don't buy this.
__label__1	"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing...: Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."
__label__2	The best eye gel I've ever used!!: I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!
__label__2	"Amazing! Entertaining! I didn't want to miss a second!: I enjoyed every minute of this captivating, lively, and fun extreme sport documentary. I promise that you will be so engaged whether you plan to watch it alone or with a bunch of friends. To be honest, I am not a real sport-fan, but ""Keep Your Eyes Open"" entertained me immensely. Awesome film!"
__label__2	Their Great Recordings on Vee-Jay: This has 32 tracks from their late 50's early 60's Vee-Jay recordings, including the complete LP Will The Circle Be Unbroken, oop since 1992. Most of the other Vee-Jay stuff is now out of print on CD, so buy this instead of the over-inflated collector's prices for those discs
__label__1	I HATE IT: OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US READ IT AND WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!
__label__1	"Grainy image: I can't resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it's being returned today. I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!"
__label__1	"Uses yellow ink: I would not buy this printer again. It quickly uses up all the yellow ink. This is a common problem with this printer. See Yahoo Answers, search for ""hp photosmart yellow"". I think they should be recalled."
__label__1	dont bother with XP: I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!
__label__1	"Photosmart pretty dumb: Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad. Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge. Seems there's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge. I've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge. Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times, power cycle, and even sent new cartridges. Analyst at HP very nice, thought... still the display flashes ""Color Cartridge Failed"" and ""Replace Color Cartridge"". Won't even print B&W. Dumb thing..."
__label__1	Epson is better and bad software driver: My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!
__label__1	"Disappointed: I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. It has completely broken down, will not acknowledge that it has paper, and the ""carriage"" is broken. It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams. I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the ""carriage"" is so expensive. Though it does print beautiful photos, I am very disappointed with this product's performance over time!"
__label__2	HP workhorse: Great Printer, but does get a bit cranky at times. The 2 side print capability is a plus, saving paper & making printouts more compact. Does a 4 + job on photos, but hard to use the small photo tray. I've used this printer for approx 2 years and just now feel it may be time to upgrade. I feel I made a good choice for my photos.
__label__2	Neat book for starters into continuous-time finance: Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance. No deep background in math is required to have a good grasp of this book. I believe it is intuition rather than fancy skills that is important to build up interest and passion for studying a hard topic such as continuous-time finance.
__label__1	one elephant charm? you've got to be kidding.: when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?
__label__2	KI A Road Anyone Can walk: This is a very interesting book describing KI and how anyone can use it for various applications in life. Anyone would be happy with this book.
__label__1	"Spare us: I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
__label__1	Junk Music: Stop listening to her music years ago. How do you explain this person who only comes out to the public when she is promoting a record. Money $$$$$$$ is her only satisfaction that and puting down the United States to anyone stupid enough to listen. Barbie, go join Jane Fonda on your hate tours.
__label__1	dissapointing: dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. The duet5s in particular have beengiven inappropriate arrangements.
__label__1	Boring: Who'd Have Thought?: Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS's voice sounds worn and tired.If she really cared, she would tour with all new songs and sing like she was happy to be there and NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS. :)For those of you unsure as to whether or not to buy the CD, wait a month and it will be in the cutout bin.I give this 2 stars in honor of the late Mr. Peter Matz, thanked by BS in the liner notes in her usual pompous way.
__label__2	Has Streisand stayed too long at the fair? NO,NO,NO.......: Hello People.I had the guilty pleasure of seeing Streisand in Atlanta on Nov 2,2006.I flew form Dallas to Atlanta and i would do it again,I was part of history,some of you people just kill me with your mean sprits,Barbra is barbra none of us are the same when we were in our prime,why not be glad and happy she's out there singing,why must we a people always compare,if your a true fan you will just but the cd and support her,and Mr.Gavin j Mcleod I know your mother taught you better then that but as Barbra has she before it easier to CRITCIZE then praise.come on folk's rise above.The Cd is awesome let's enjoy her and her music ok? OK.God bless you all and remember wouldn't it be wonderful,If we could all be a little more gentle with each other,and a little more loving,have a little more empathy,and maybe,just maybe we'd like each other a little bit more..........Rock on Barbra Srteisad your the best,and Thank you for all the year's......
__label__2	Great musice but dissapointed in the actual concert: The music is ok on this, yes her voice isn't what is was in the past but everyone gets older. Still wonderful to hear.I saw Barbra on her first night in Chicago on the 2006 tour and although this fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing her in concert, I was not at all impressed with her choice of Il Divo. They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows, I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for. An entirely different experience and as she will most likely never tour again, there went my one chance to experience Barbra as she should be.
__label__2	10 Stars at Least!: Brilliant recording, great songs, just enough flavour of the concert without too much talking, not enough singing. Nice to see Herself allow the imperfections that make her human, but still so far above the most perfect of anyone else. She is a treasure of the world.
__label__2	Streisand:Live in Concert (2 CD's): This is one of the best Barbra has ever done, I have listened to it in full probably ten times since last week when I bought it. It is so incredible. I am waiting for the day that this is out in DVD to see her in action while I listen to her. God has truly blessed her with unbelievable talent.
__label__2	AMAZING: I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my CD. I was at the concert in Atlanta and was mesmerized during the entire show. It was so surreal..to be in the company of Barbra and Il Divo. I know the CD will be great. It will be the first thing loaded in my car. And, it will probably stay in there for quite a while. There is and will be no other Barbra. I only wish she would tour more often.
__label__2	Like Buttah!: Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!
__label__2	Streisand Live - Amazing: Barbra Streisand for over 46 years has been an entertainer beyond words. Her 2006 tour and subsequent 2007 European tour are sell out sensations. This CD captures part of her performance which is quite powerful. The stage presence alone is numbing, the vocals are rich, deep and so moving. The pairing with Il Divo is fantastic, they have brilliant voices, but are eclipsed by the legend. This is a must have for everyone, especially those who weren't able to see her in concert. What could you want more, how about a DVD to go along with it?
__label__2	great writing, informative: Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion. There is very little on comparative government or a blueprint for change. Lazare appears to favor a parliamentary system, but he does not spell this out in any detail, or say very much about voting reform.
__label__1	Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!!: This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. If you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. The inside area is made entirely of black plastic. However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. I returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!
__label__1	Too Small: Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
__label__1	Maybe this is only for coffee beans.: Bought this for a gift and was wondering how it would fit coffee grounds and have room for the filters. I thought maybe the filters were under the lid. Well, it must be only for coffee beans and only a small amount. The filter holder takes up one side of the container and it's not for the kind of rippled filters that we use. It holds ones that are flat. The person we bought it for ended up using it without the lid for a utensil holder.
__label__2	Filter compartment smaller than I thought: Love the look and quality. But coffee filters for a regular sized coffee maker do not fit in the filter compartment.
__label__1	Costs $10.89 at Target online: Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
__label__1	misleading cd: This is not Lighthouse. This is the ST Luke UMC Lighthouse Praise Band. I am returning it to Amazon because it looks like Chrstian filler.
__label__1	Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware: Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift.
__label__1	Great idea--terrible design!: Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!
__label__1	Big Disappointment: I purchased this for my son who is a huge Justice League fan. He gets discouraged because it is always falling apart. I hate it, because I am always putting it back together. I would not recommend anyone buying this toy unless you want to keep putting it together.
__label__1	Bad Design, just buy the figures: We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. The elevator uses a string pulley which promptly bound around the gear that connects it to the thumbwheel which raises and lowers the platform. Within 5 minutes of playing, one of the main features broke. Also, the top has a ring with 5 rockets, one of these came missing a retaining pin. Thoroughly disappoingting as he is a big Justice League fan.
__label__1	Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you.: This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices.
__label__2	A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had read the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don't want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it's own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!
__label__1	"Don't waste your money: This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
__label__1	A very bad choice: The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. Problem is this toy is nearly impossible to build and it's more than the comically unreadable directions that are at fault. I have built many a toy but never found one this resistant to having its snap on parts snap on and of course if and when they finally do, the least shake will undo your labor. Sure to end in tears and frustration for all.
__label__1	A PIECE OF JUNK!: Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash.
__label__1	Don't waste your money: This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it. The set is always falling apart. The elevator broke after the first day. My friend bought this for her son as well, and she is just as frustrated as we are. I would not recommend buying this unless you have hours to spare re-assembly it and keeping up with all the parts that contiunally fall off it. [...]
__label__1	Not for children to PLAY with!: This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!
__label__1	Garbage!: My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money.
__label__1	Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend!: I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!
__label__1	Not very durable: This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. The elevator won't work, and I had to forcefully put some of the pieces together. Most people who reviewed this toy, had the same complaints, but I bought it anyway, because my nephew really wanted it. I'm glad that I only paid $15.00 for it, because it's not worth any more than that. Some pieces came off, before my nephew even got a chance to play with it.
__label__1	A nice showpiece but falls apart with the slightest touch!: What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35.
__label__1	Son loves it, but it does fall apart: My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc.
__label__1	Another lame mattel product: Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.
__label__1	Watchtower is total crap!!: Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.
__label__2	My daughter loves this toy: I bought this for Christmas. It was somewhat challanging to put together properly, but after that it was quite fun for my five year old. I know when she plays with this due to the sound fx.
__label__1	A peice of Junk: When you put it standing up on its legs, it falls down. A friend of mine has one. He tried repeatedly to get it to stand up, but it just fell down with the slightest touch! After a while we were realy fed up. It was over $39.00!
__label__1	A toy not made to last: This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.
__label__2	Very well acted and directed: While the first half feels predictable and very TV movie, theperformances are good enough (especially Helen Mirren) to keep itgoing.And in the second half, this tale of a collage student mother's helperhired to help a woman in an angry depression after suffering a nervousbreakdown gets more complex and unpredictable.The relationship between the two women, and they way their damagedsouls play off each other is quite moving and grown up.Strong subtle direction by Kevin Bacon.Does take a hit for over the top performances from the kids, and otherkey small roles, all playing types, not human beings.
__label__2	"A World Within a World: ""A World Within a World"" says it all. This is probably the best CD I own. I absolutly LOVE silverchair, I have been a fan since they first came out with ""Tomorrow"". This CD just proves how diverse and talented they are. Daniel Johns (lead singer) has such a beautiful and magestic voice.It definitely makes all troubles go away by just listening to it. It is soooo great to hear these bright and happy lyrics. I am looking forward to hearing much more from them."
__label__1	Poor reliability: I have had several of these monitors. I use a two-monitor set-up.-The backlight on the first burned out one month out of warrantee. ViewSonic would not replace the first monitor- fair enough as it was out of warrantee. I purchased a replacement. When it came, the screen was blue, and the color could not be adjusted. ViewSonic sent a replacement which had a green screen, and again, the color could not be adjusted. They were unable to find another VA912b, so they sent a different model to replace it.-Meanwhile, my second monitor, again a VA912b burned out the backlight after less than six months of use.-Beware that the glowing reviews you see for this monitor may not take into account its poor reliability. Should you choose this monitor, be sure to get an extended warrantee! Better yet, do yourself a favor and choose another model or manufacturer.
__label__1	"I am returning it today....: I bought this from frys and am returning it today. Maybe it's only me, but mine had really bad quality and distorted images. I had 17"" LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem. Now, 19"" has same problem and I am done with viewsonic. I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again. Instead, I am going to try samsung ones."
__label__1	Dead Pixels: I've had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year. It has been good to be until now. I have been losing pixels every week for the past month. I'm out 25-30 pixels. Aren't products suppose to last longer then this?
__label__1	Not sure that this is a great product .: The thing is I like the display and everything , but the first monitor when I got had a bad pixel in the middle . So I understand it happens , return it and got another one same model . Two days later the same thing happen , and two more days I got one more bad pixel . So I am returning this one as well ,but no exchange this time . Just not worth it . Plus you can not adjust it , it stays only in one position .It may not happen anything with this bad pixels , but I don't want to take a chance . It's a hassle .
__label__2	Great book: I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers, and I was so excited when I found this book. I was not let down, It may not be something I read again like I do Kinsella books but few are. I loved it, it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care, I still fully enjoyed this.
__label__1	No Cocktails For Me, Thanks: I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books and her writing style...but this book was awful. The story line was predictable and the writing flat and unoriginal. Makes you wonder if this was truly written by Kinsella or a way for a ghost writer to get started under her 'new' pen name. I don't plan on buying anymore Madeline Wickham books--stick to the original Kinsella, where I haven't been disappointed yet.
__label__1	Where is her tell-tale wit?!: I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all.
__label__2	Keep em coming!: Classic Chick-lit. Fun, sexy, juicy, leave you wanting more book about love and all things girls. These books keep me out of therapy. ;)
__label__1	"A harlequin romance for the new age: OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting ""War and Peace"" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The ""nice girl"", the evil vengenful ""psycho-girl"", the ""I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl"", the ""torn between job vs family girl""..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word ""frission"" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's ""Elements of Style"" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's."
__label__1	Boring...: I couldn't get into this one. I felt the story was lacking and dragging on. I didn't get through half of it before I gave up.
__label__2	okay: I liked the book but it wasn't one of my favorite reads. It ended up being a good book overall.
__label__2	"Cocktail For Three: Love, love, love! Got this for a ""beach read"" & fell in love with the characters. Very well written with no slow, boring parts."
__label__2	Entertaining Book: It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good book. The portrayal of a working first time mom and the two different worlds is insightful. There were a couple surprise twists.
__label__2	A Fun Read: I didn't realize until I picked up this title at my local Borders that Sophie Kinsella wrote under another name - Madeleine Wickham. What a pleasant surprise!As a fan of the Shopaholic Series, and found this book to actually be more like Sophie's recent title - the Undomestic Goddess. The dialog was witty, yet believable. I found myself wanting to rush in and protect Candice from the evil Heather, comfort Roxanne during her loss, and tell Maggie that everything was going to be alright, and she would adjust to motherhood just fine. As a new mom, I could totally empathize with Maggie and her struggles!I can't wait to read more titles by Madeleine!
__label__2	A good summer read: This is unlike the other books that i have read so far. the plot revolves around a bar and three best friends. They are good at their jobs,articulate and know what they want from life. But a crazy flat-mate, an affair with a superior and motherhood corode their friendship and their lives-almost. This book is about true friendship and how it can get you through the day and lives problems big or small. A good read that cannot be put down.
__label__1	"hard to read--both format and content: This book is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word ""pleasure"" spelled out as one word. ""Plea sure""? Is that a British thing? Many many words where there were mysterious hyphens, words broken into syllables ""so ci a ble"" was one. Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor."
__label__2	"A Rare Find - Wonderful!: I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well, I found it! ""Cocktails for Three"" by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.""Cocktails"" goes beyond your basic ""friends forever"" novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine."
__label__1	A Little Disappointing: I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much.
__label__1	"Hated it so much I returned it: I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
__label__2	Good chick lit!: This was a very good, fun light read. Very much enjoyed it. Am looking forward to reading more of her books!
__label__1	Skip it: Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass.
__label__1	Eby dead! 12/27/02: Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime. FALSE PROPHET ALERT
__label__2	Encouraging Testimony of Life After Death Experience: This is a fantastic life after death experience written by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it encouraged me tremendously after the recent death of my son, who had also proclaimed his faith in Christ before God took him. I enjoyed the book so much, I read it twice.
__label__1	"Inspiring, but please don't defend fraudulent claims: I went to hear Dr. Eby speak thirty years ago, and at the time I was quite impressed. I bought this book and quickly read it, and was deeply inspired.HOWEVER, I DO remember Dr. Eby quite confidently claim to say that Jesus told him that he would not die before Jesus returned. I remember how it struck me just like the promise that Simeon had about not dying before seeing the Messiah (which he did, when Jesus was presented in the Temple shortly after his birth.)This was not an isolated claim; he made it several times, including shortly before his death in 2002. On the basis of this FALSE claim (unless you believe that Jesus lied to him), I cannot recommend this book, no matter how ""inspiring"" it might be. Dr. Eby was a fraud, pure and simple, and a false prophet. To say otherwise is not to respect the facts."
__label__1	Very poor condition BUT? Good read!: I saw D. Ebby 35 years ago on the 700 Club, wanted this book for all those years. It was brought to my attention by another minister of the gospel just recently. Saw it on Amazon and decided to buy it, it was inexpensive. The pages fell apart as I read the book, it was extremely frustrating but? So enjoyable and encouraging, I was glad I bought it. I am going to look for the same book in better condition, just to reread or give to another to enjoy.
__label__2	This book changed my life!: Dr. Richard Eby has experienced many miracles in his life. But his story of life after death changed my life. He falls off a balcony and splits his head open. They rush him to the hospital and thinking he is dead they sew his head up without cleaning the wound. God shows him a glimpse of heaven. Afterwards he cannot remember the the fall. Later God lets him relive the fall to be able to tell others about the experience. A few years later while visiting the Holy Land. He enters the Tomb of Lazarus and everything goes dark. God speaks to him and tells him that he showed him a glimpse of heaven, now he will show him a glimpse of hell. His story is amazing! I saw him on a television show telling his story in 1979. I then went out and bought his book. It gave me the desire to start reading my Bible. Which is the greatest book of all!
__label__2	"An absolutely uplifting book -- an incredible story: One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and ""feel good"" book. A great book to read to kids too!"
__label__2	The Greatest Play on Earth!: I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever.
__label__2	Dark Fantasy with MORALS: I loved this book, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. Judging people like saying someone is a dork, jock, etc. could be murderous like in the book they killed themselves. It is realistic but fiction.
__label__2	My Favorite Shakespeare: The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic.
__label__2	as advertised: It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.
__label__2	It was better in the movie: Well, it was very romantic and very imaginative, totally complicated and fantastic to analyze, very emotional. I'm touched deeply with Shakespeare.
__label__2	Feedback: I ordered textbooks for my child's high school classes. I was pleased to receive the books within a short period of time. Also, the books were all in great shape upon arrival! I felt each book that I received was accurately described.
__label__2	Excellent!: My 15 year old daughter is using this for her English/Drama studies. The side-by-side text is a huge help. The information preceding each act is very helpful and interesting as are the comprehension questions at the end of each section.
__label__1	Disappointed: I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. I am very disappointed because that is the only reason I purchased this book. They should not use printed version reviews for Kindle books.
__label__2	Great Book!: Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!
__label__1	Wow.. can't believe i paid money for this: This book's got coffee stain all over and in the poorest condition. Can't believe i paid 5 dollars for this crap
__label__1	Don't watch this book.: This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir! The remix WAS better.
__label__1	Never got here.: I can't review this item because it never made it to me. I received an email a few days later saying the money would be credited back to me (which it was). However, I have never had a problem with receiving shipments at my address. The seller claimed that my address was not found. I received something from a different seller just 2 days before though. I am not sure what address they tried to send it to, but it was not the one I gave. Unfortunately I had to find this book somewhere else. The book is a great find, however, and I am very pleased with it.
__label__2	Great for mature Sixth Graders!: I use Romeo and Juliet as a unit in my literature class, but only when I have a mature class of Sixth Graders. Therefore, I do not use it every year. After a lesson on pronouncing some of the English and what it means, I pick the best readers to do the reading, and switch off daily. We also study the conflicts and do quite an indepth study of the play. They love it!! I end with the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet on Video. The Dover Press edition makes it affordable to buy every student a copy for them to make notes in and keep when we are done!!!
__label__2	Good, but footnotes are too much.: This version uses footnotes too much. Every little unclear word is attached to a footnote. It's very distracting when reading and takes you away from this book. A lot of the words don't need to be footnoted, I guess the editor thought that the people who would read this would be idiots.
__label__1	I hate it.: Terrible book. I'm not into classics, so if you're like me, don't buy it. If you like them, buy it.
__label__2	Great book and all but....: The book unfortunately doesn't have line numbers next to them. Now I'm not sure if this is a bug on my kindle, or if it goes for everybody who has this book, but line numbers aren't there. I need to read this book for school and it would help if there are line numbers for reference. Other than that it is a pretty good book!
__label__2	Amazing for struggling readers: I ordered this book for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet. It has the Shakespeare version on one side and the plain English translation on the other. It really helped some of my lower level students get involved in learning the play instead of getting discourage because they didn't understand the language. I highly recommend this product, especially for struggling readers.
__label__1	Shakespeare: As we all have one time or another, had to read shakespeare in school for English class. That was my reason for this, my son needed it for school. I'm just glad it was available. He needed to Kill a Mokingbird, it wasn't available for Kindle.
__label__2	this book makes it very easy to understand the writing in this book.: this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
__label__1	wrong cover: I guess maybe it said they have the right to change the cover, but the one we received was completely different! Looked like an old Harlequin romance novel.... also the book had people reviewing it along with the text and my daughter didnt like that format.
__label__1	Not new as stated: This product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the book. I was disappointed with this since I wanted a new version of this book.
__label__1	"notes are not on the left page - get the other version: There are 2 versions of this book available on Amazon. The other version looks identical in the picture but if you look inside, it isn't. This one does not have the ""translation"" of Shakespeare on the left page, which is what most high school students need. If you want the notes, get the other book."
__label__2	Romeo & Juliet: Experienced no problems with the order. The book came within the estimated delivery date. The book matched the description given.
__label__2	Complex Love: I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!
__label__1	Very Disappointed: I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold.
__label__1	Not Impressed: This book does not have line numbers. In addition, the pages don't have the scene or act number on them. So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there. This book makes it difficult to follow with others in class and I would not recommend it to anyone.
__label__1	Very difficult to hear: If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. I have been using it as a tool to get the students to hear professional actors and to then ask them to use the same skills those professional actors use (inflection, emphasis, etc.) The problem is it is VERY difficult to hear...to the point that you have to sit 3 feet away to hear it at times. This simply does not work for a classroom.
__label__1	"Literary junk food for the masses: Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out.*R&J* is simply sensationalist trash. It contains a good portion of Shakespeares worst verse and insipid characterizations. It's unchallenging, crude, and simply melodrama for the most part. It's the Shakespearean equivalent of ""Party of Five"" and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this ""play"" (why not call it a ""B-play?"") is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. ""Hamlet,"" although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is ""Caesar.""And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the ""Bard's"" shadow. Had Marlowe lived, we wouldn't have even known about Shakespeare. And Donne finally been recognized for the genius that he is."
__label__1	Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story review: As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story
__label__1	stupid student review by gabriel c: Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
__label__1	the movie was better: i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg.
__label__1	Signet Shakespeare Kindle verions: To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. It was a very unhelpful sample, giving a selection of the introductory essay about Shakespeare's life and times.So I scoured the review page. None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page? Are there additional annotations beyond the essay about Shakespeare's life and times? Are there links to acts or scenes? Are there line numbers?
__label__1	Does not match picture.: The picture for this item showed the lines to be numbered. When we received it, it was not numbered. This is needed for a class assignment and we had to go elsewhere to purchase what Amazon did not provide.
__label__1	Warnings for teachers trying to use this in your classrooms: Here are the problems with using this in the classroom:1. The lines are not numbered, so students will have to number the lines as homework for every scene, or else you'll waste a lot of class time doing this.2. The paper quality is terrible for annotating: Mechanical pencil lead gets caught on the fibers, and any ink but ballpoint pens spreads out.3. Very few terms are annotated in the book, so you'll need to keep your own glossary inside the front cover because there's very little space to annotate.4. Prestwick House has an annotated copy with line numbers, plenty of space in the margins, high-quality paper, scene-by-scene glossary in the back, reader's tips for reading Shakespeare, and extra textbook-type help. Guess how much: 99 cents!
__label__1	Basic Romeo and Juliet: I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions.
__label__2	book review: Shipped promptly! Just what dauther needed and in time for her to read for her English class! I would recommend!
__label__2	R&J-Summary By EricaH: Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. It's a story that will make your heart sink. This magnificent couple had such a strong love for each other. It was so strong that they died together. In the beginning it was crazy how they are enemies and they want to be together but it's hard to because what they are doing is wrong to their families. At the ending they died together with their love stronger than ever, it's a heartbreaking story, wishing that they would live happily ever after.I really enjoyed this story, although I do wish that they could have lived to be together and in love.
__label__2	I don't know: I don't know want the book is about yet Hahaha so can I read now? Thank you ? This is I don't know
__label__2	Love Unrealized: This play taught: That love cannot survive prejudice, young love is powerful because it is raw, no one can control nature, and more.
__label__2	A great edition!: I love the Cambridge School series of Shakespeare's plays because of the way it helps you along as you read. Not only does it explain the language, but it explains the Elizabethan puns and points out things that you would have never noticed. I recommend this book to everyone, especially teachers for their classes.
__label__2	The Best Review Ever Seen: Alejandro and Martin.After reading `Romeo and Juliet', we noticed the difficult vocabulary that Shakespeare used. It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising.
__label__2	"A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future."
__label__2	...MaGicaL...: Books by Shakespere is something you just don't read for fun, you read it slowly by savoring the moments of every word spoken by each character. By reading Romeo and Juliet, you would understand the tragidy because of love...and how they both would risk their lives for each other. Shakespere is the man who can really define true love.
__label__2	"Shakespeare's best!: I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don't say ""wherefore"" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read."
__label__1	Cliche, lacks literary value: This is probably the most cliche novel ever written. It's boring as well and isn't even in English. Fail!
__label__1	"Gimmie A Break!: Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__1	Getting old: This may be one of the great works of humanity, but it just doesn't cut it for me. The gender sterotypes are nauseating, to say the least. Though required in schools, this book is nnot one of the bests to read on your own time. Or maybe I am just disillussioned.
__label__1	i didnt understand: I bought this book hoping it could help me understand shakespeare's words better, but it didnt. Instead I had to look up every other word in a dictionary or sometimes even online. Soon it just got so hectic that i just threw the book out and bought a better more reliable source.
__label__2	The Best of Shakespeare: This is the best tragedy ever written. I wish this had professional audio! I recommend this book to any, and everyone.
__label__1	Very mediocre, middle of the road collection: That sums up this collection well. It's put out by Club Med and, perhaps that says something is some people's minds. What it amounts to is a fairly non-offensive collection of big-name artists (Kool and The Gang, Wes Montgomery, Roy Ayers, Sweetback - of Sade fame) doing downtempo. Think of it as muzak that is likely played at Club Med resorts or Sandals resorts to vacationers who find Club Med still suitable (as if it somehow ever was). South Beach, Monaco, Cannes sur Mer or St. Tropez discrimnating tastes this is not.I will say that it does have packaging and style over substance, but beyond that, there are far superior products out there, literally for a fraction of the cost. Avoid this unless you have absolutely everything else in your collection and far nothing better to listen to (which I doubt).
__label__2	A must have: If you're a Dolly Parton fan (even somewhat of a fan), this is a must have for your collection. It will NOT disappoint!!
__label__2	A Really good Overview: I have always dug Dolly Parton&this Double Disc Set is a must have for any Newbie getting into Dolly's Work. She is a Good Songwriter&Vocalist who has always had Her own Distinctive style. yes she is long overdue for a Strong Box set,but this Collection covers many of Her Hits&also Pre Cross-Over Run.
__label__2	"Moxy Unleashed: This is a live cd(2002), with all of their great hits from all the albums combined. Hard driving rock and roll, like always the great bands come from Canada. Over the years Moxy has not given up, they keep pressing on. This has their all time master piece"" Sail on, Sail away"". Plus 16 other great songs. Very strong singing from Brian and backed up by the best. Do yourself a great justice and get this cd."
__label__1	Very Thorough, yet Tough to Read: Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance.
__label__1	"copy shop edition: The stars are for the edition, not the book.The April 30, 2011 edition from CreateSpace (which probably actually is a copy shop) does not look like a book. It looks like a leaflet from Jehova's witnesses. It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning ""not a real book"" or not be sold on amazon at all."
__label__1	Binge: British Light Music: Never ordered it, it was sent by mistake and I returned it upon receipt without even opening it so I don't know.
__label__1	Really, how is a movie like this sold to anyone?: It's a blatant ripoff of Predators and not even a good one at that. It has the feel of a movie made in someone's backyard. I feel bad for Sorbo and Woodbine. They once had careers, but now they're doing homemade movies for some Garcia kid down the street.
__label__1	massivie waste of time: this by far the most ,waste time i have ever spent on a movie let a lone money.a horrible try at predator and an complete failure. they did not even put letters on the dog tags,how pitaful.do not waste your money as i did.Sorbo is out of shape ,compltey,show's the same senre mutible times,who ever has been in a jungle with no incests ,sorbo was.
__label__1	Would rather watch grass grow: I have seen many many movies in my life and this one takes the cake as being the biggest waste of time, terrible film I have EVER seen. Honestly, to think someone actually made this movie makes me believe anyone can make a movie. Everything about this movie is just so bad it makes me want to vomit.
__label__2	KEVIN SORBO: This is a good movie. Made with low budget and yet great locations, the story just flows easily. We've seen movies like this before, and still it's a pleasure to watch the talented and handsome and strong actor Kevin Sorbo as a military leader searching for a scary soldier...Indeed, a fun movie!
__label__1	"A very, very cheap rip off of predators. Only missing a few things. I say D: ""If these guys can't fix it, Hell no one can."" After a group of scientists goes missing, the army hires an elite covert team led by Tyler (Sorbo) to go and investigate and rescue them. When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of ""Predators"". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like ""Predators"". If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.Would I watch again? - No way! I will not be getting this for my store.*Also try - Predators"
__label__1	A curmudgeon review: Ok, military soldiers have short hair cuts, but not Sorbo. The first air-boat scene, the air boat was so overloaded, it could barely move. The script was so poor, that I wanted to vomit. A soldier takes a look at a corpse from 2 feet and says that the head has been drilled into and the brains sucked out, making him better than Kay Scarpatta. Really!
__label__1	"pound the booty for 20 min.....: it was a predator remake... a terrible one! the movie sucked. pay close attention to what they say, and there weapons (which change constintantly in there hands).. just bad, when one male soldier asks another male soldier if they have postpartum depression (depression that can happen to women after they have a baby) you start to question things. at one point, a soldier with a complete serious face, trying to act cool. said this ""I really need to stop smoking these things, i used to punish the booty for 2 hrs. now i can only last 20 min"". he was completely serious! just terrible... the blood was so bad that when someone got shot in the head, it looked like a spray can of red paint was shot from the back of his head.I tried to rate this as 0 stars, but this site did not allow me."
__label__1	15 Minutes of Cable Access Style Bio: If you want a low-tech, outdated, poorly produced micro-biography of Ralph Ellison that runs about 15 minutes (that's right--ignore the time posted above because it certainly isn't 30), then this may be what you are looking for.
__label__1	Protect a bed mattress cover: I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing.
__label__2	Fabulous: I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
__label__1	"Bad cutting and way too big: It's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. I ordered size M as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. It's way too big. I exchanged it for size S. I have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well. It's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. Thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. Very ill fitting."
__label__1	"Doesn't fit well/hard to take off: I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model's costume. The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy. The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4"", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top. The cut of the top made me look flat (34B). I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing. Overall it was cute--but it just looks so much better on the model."
__label__1	Not cut well: This costume is poorly cut. Areas through the bust/underarms bunch up and won't lay flat. I have an average build -- not flat, and not busty (35 B/C). I ordered an XS. But while the waist fit, the bust area was tight and dug into the underarms.
__label__1	hmm...: I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it.
__label__1	Cheap: This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night.
__label__1	Cheap Quality: Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging.
__label__1	Earring case: Unable to use. Compartments too tiny and too deep to reach in to get earrings - and I don't have unusually large fingers.
__label__1	Wish I could Order this Item: I could really use this Item but I won't order it if I cannot order the color that I want; guess I'll have to look elsewhere.....sorry, this company seems to be losing a lot of sales with the 'let us choose for you' policy.
__label__1	No Choice of color???: It's simple. If I don't get to choose the color I want, I don't buy it. Is this company run by idiots??
__label__1	Another Lost Sale: I too was ready to buy this product, but will not do it if I can't get the color I choose. I guess this company doesn't want to put their customers first!
__label__1	Color does matter: Like the others, I will not buy this item unless I can chose the color. Of course the color matters. The company must not understand that customers like choices.
__label__1	no color choice, no buy: I want a specific color, not a random one. Thanks to the reviews, I won't be buying this one either !
__label__1	Color selection.: I find it very frustrating not to be able to choose my own color! If this practice was changed, I might order this product!
__label__1	Locking Earring Case: I want to buy this product, but I want it in Black.....Why should I allow you to choose the color when I'm paying.
__label__1	Folks...if you offer various color pictures for item, then offer the color choice for sale!: Ok...ditto to all the other comments. I have searched all over for days for a blue jewelry earring / ring box for my 87 yr. old mom for Christmas. I am set to order it, then see you can't choose a color. What a big waste of my time and effort. This was just what I was looking for and no color choice. How dumb is that!
__label__1	Poor option: Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
__label__1	NOT WATER PROOF: Don't waste your money buying this tent. I went on a week-long camping trip, and the second night, we had a rain storm. It rained IN THE TENT. The rain fly did nothing, water was dripping from the ceiling, and all down the sides. I was so dissapointed, not to mention soaking wet. I plan on returning it asap.
__label__2	"Hands-Down Yello's Finest Album: I've been a Yello fan since Solid Pleasure's release and I've experience the best (One Second, Claro Que Si) and worst (Zebra) of what this group has to offer. One Second is the pinnacle of their work and is one of my all-time favorite albums ever.Even though this album is getting on in years, the sounds and rhythyms remains timeless...both dark and tenebrous as well as hypnotic and majestic. ""Santiago"" finds (and keeps) the groove of all grooves, ""Moon On Ice"" drips with atmosphere, and ""Call It Love"" sports an excellent guitar hook. Even the repeat track ""Oh Yeah"" (previously on Stella), fits in with the entire composition.This album is sheer genius and belongs in any music lover's collection."
__label__2	The album divine: This album is the best of Yello's earliest albums. My favourite song is Si Senor The Hairy Grill, but Call It Love is also good as well as Goldrush, Dr Van Steiner, The Rythm Divine and L'Hotel. I havn't quite get used to the other songs (as you often have to do with Yello's songs). Buy this album!
__label__2	Unevenly Fantastic: This album has some of the most fascinating,bizarre sound at some points and other songs are flat out boring. Si Senor The Hairy Grill being the masterpiece of the bunch with an organ biuldup to an amazing crescendo of screaming guitars (or is it just screaming?). Dr. Van Steiner, Goldrush, the latin~tinged La Habanera, and to a lesser extent, Oh Yeah, are all fine, and incredibly inventive tunes. Shirley Bassey is great in the Rhythm Devine, but the rest is a tad blah. Still worth it for all the greatness, and was a must buy for me as I used to have it in the 80's and really missed it. Jamming out to Si Senor was worth it all.
__label__2	"One second, Forever: Great tunes dripping with latin up beat melodies and smooth syncopation. One track could have easily appeared in a 007 flick.Slick production and sound makes for great party music ; dancing or sitting ! ""Oh yeah"" will always turn an ear with or without the accompaning movie......."
__label__2	One of the most innovative Cd's of all time.: Take time to listen to the samples [....] If you do not own this album, then get it. Get it any way you can. The music is beyond innovative. The sounds remain timeles. If you are going to have a party get this CD. Your friends will love it. I personaly have thousands of Cd's and this is by far one of the most important ones. Just listen to it. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.
__label__2	Hypnotic sounds abound on this great Yello CD: This is one of my favourite Yello albums. It is inventive, amusing, creative and fun to listen to. Some of the songs are very moody and atmospheric, others are upbeat. It's better than older Yello in my opinion and a good place to start if you are new to their sound.
__label__2	book review: This book does not have the most up-to-date photography but they are good enough and the general sentiment and prose are very nice. It gracefully combines science with the wonder of it all which makes a lovely combination. I had it 26 years ago when I was pregant and still recommend it.
__label__2	Know what is happening inside you: Pregnancy can be a very long wait. This book helps a lot by giving you a month by month accounting of what is happening in the development of the baby, both in words and with awesome photos.Highly recommend for any new mom-to-be.
__label__1	1962 version bothered me: I have several fetal development books now, but this one is the only one I couldn't stand to keep. I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me. That sort of thing is not what I want to see when I'm expecting! The authors other book, Beginning Life is much, much better. It has better pictures and is more sensitive to the well-being of the pictured fetuses.
__label__2	Great Book - A must for every pregnant woman!: This is the same book I looked at every week when I was pregnant, and now my granddaughter is using it! Awesome!
__label__1	I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back.: I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it.
__label__1	A bit disappointed: While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the book in general. It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother. The book was first published in 1962 with an update in 1982 and I'm sure there have been quite a few new discoveries that would be quite informative for a first time mother since then. I felt like I was reading a high school biology book. OK for what it was but I'd not recommend it.
__label__2	Another masterwork: Jerry Goldsmith created soundscapes that sometimes surpassed the films they were written for in evoking emotions and revealing character. For Logan's Run, Goldsmith came up with one of his most brilliant creations. It opens with stark, electronic sounds, effectively mirroring the cold future society depicted in the film. Only when Logan breaks out of the domed city and into the natural world does Goldsmith allow the full orchestra to come in, warming up the music just as Logan's worldview expands. This release finally captures the full range and power of the score in pristine sound. And, heck, I even like the Love Theme tacked on at the end...
__label__2	Logan's Run-Limited Edition: I've always been a fan of film scores, and I've wanted this one on CD for a long time. I got the LP version when the film was first released & still have it. What makes this CD special is the fact that there are alternate selections included that were not part of the original CD release, and that this release was limited to 3,000 copies. I've been enjoying it very much!
__label__2	Wonderful soundtrack: This soundtrack is amazing. Nice music from Jerry Goldsmith. Very hard to find CD. One of his best soundtracks ever made. When you find it buy it.
__label__2	Informative and entertaining to read: For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it.
__label__1	Lacking: This book lacks the depth it seems to promise. Some of the illustrations are lacking. There is not enough meat to help anyone with special needs learners. I would suggest you look elsewhere. I was greatly disappointed since the majority of work by Jensen is wonderful.
__label__1	Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative: The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know.
__label__1	too old: Written in 1970's it's really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Glad I bought it used-but shipping was more than the price!
__label__2	"Invaluable: The chapters on ""Genuine Encounter"" and ""I-Messages"" are worth reading again and again. Although this book is old, the messages are fresh today. I see parents every day who do not enjoy their children; this book encourages you to appreciate your children every day - a great gift."
__label__1	"Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population: Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."
__label__2	"FORGET PAGE 144: I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors ""outdated"" views on homosexuality - this is their opinion. Homosexuality is definitely an identity crisis and professional help should most definitely be sought immediately. There should be no doubt that individuals with a gay or bisexual agenda wrote the careless and irresponsible comments above. On the whole, the book is excellent. If you don't agree with page 144 just tear it out and your done."
__label__2	Good: It was a good book with a good lesson. I just prefer 1,2,3 Magic (Effective Discipline for Children 2-12) by Thomas W. Phelan, PhD.
__label__1	Bone chilling outdated views: I was just about to buy this book for my child bearing friend when I saw the outdated view to homosexuality. Pitty. This book is very good in many espects; but in the event of the child or anyone close to the family being homosexual, this will probably result in parent's mishandling of the situation which will perhaps do a good deal of damage to the child's self esteem.
__label__1	VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality: While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!
__label__2	[...]: As the author of [...] I recommend Your Child's Self-Esteem with all my heart.Until my book was out I told my clients, readers and workshop participants to read Briggs book. Although I treat tantrums differently, I find most of what Briggs said over 30 years agostill in line with my own guidance. She was way ahead of her timeand for the most part the book will give you everything you needto know about your child's self-esteem and more.
__label__2	best parenting book: This was the best parenting book we ever read. It teaches you how to tune in and listen to your child and really hear what they say and don't say. I now give this to everyone I know who has a child.
__label__2	Awesome Kids Drum Set!!!: We bought this drum set for our 4yr old son & he loves it! It was easy to assemble & it is very stable. It produces great sound & it will last for years!
__label__2	Two sides to every coin: 'The most dangerous man alive'? Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson.
__label__1	"Manson -Not in his own words by a long shot: Nuel Emmons, ex-con, aspiring journalist and two-faced acquaintance of Charlie, covers no new ground in this book.Emmons states himself in the preface that he wasn't allowed to take notes or record Charlie during his interviews with the famous prisoner. Therefore, the title is misleading. It should read ""Manson, in Emmons' words"". More of the same rhetoric espoused by Bugliosi and the establishment.For a better, fresher look at Manson- check out ""Charles Manson Superstar"" on VHS."
__label__1	I don't believe Manson had anything to do with this.: Ok, if your a Manson collector of course you have to have this, but otherwise it is not even a good read, let alone Manson's words.Buy it if you are collecting, but read Helter Skelter or the Family for a better read.
__label__1	"totally untrue: ""Charles Manson in Nuell Emmons's Words"" anyone who's seen or heard Manson interviewed, knows his lingo and knows those aren't his words."
__label__1	"Most Dangerous Man Alive...Yeah right!: To label Charles Manson ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"" is a farce. He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer. This book well written, therefore it could not have come from his words or hands. Then again, he has always used others to do his bidding via murder or writing. Believe what you want but I believe it is pure horse manure, although entertaining."
__label__1	Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC...: I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd
__label__2	FICTION? I THINK NOT: I HAVE READ ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE STORY OF MANSON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY.I JUDGE ALL AS HUMAN FIRST AND ALL OTHER THINGS ON CHARACTER.I NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A HIPPIE CULT LEADER,NOT THAT HE FORMED THIS FAMILY, AND BELIEVE HE KILLED NO ONE.THIS WAS JEERED BY MANSON HIMSELF BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CLOSEST REVELATION TO EXPOSE THE WAY IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF THE MEDIA.1967, MANSON ASKED NOT TO GO TO SOCIETY.HE MET FEW INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE HE HUNG OUT WITH. HE WAS SHY OF SEX. HE WAS IGNORANT AS TO HOW THINGS WERE. HE WAS INTO BING CROSBY, NOT BEATLES AND HELTER SKELTER.ONE OF THE GIRLS CREATED THAT BY HERSELF.IF IT HAD STAYED IN WHAT WAS HIS RELEASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN O.K. BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE JOINED THEM AND THE LOVE AND PEACE ERA, REVOLVED TO BIKERS, WEAPONS ,THEFTS. THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN. TRYING TO KEEP UP EXSISTANCE, SOME PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY. THEY BRANCHED OUT, BROUGHT OTHERS IN AND CHAOS EVOLVED.
__label__1	WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!: Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!
__label__1	"Manson... in someone else's words: While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'."
__label__2	excellent find: very interesting book. was one of those you do not want to put down. it gave a different perspective of the happenings of the manson family. however, one must keep in mind it was recorded from what charles manson believed happened. great book.
__label__2	a greater understanding of a sick mind: Nuel Emmons is the author, so these are his words. He only translates into readable print what Charles Manson is trying to relate to us. I have no sympathy for Manson, being where he is, as he is a grown man and is responsible for his own actions. He cannot blame his childhood for the mistakes he made as an adult.However, I do feel sorry for Charles Manson, the child. Growing up, he was totally confused, and I do have sympathy for him at that stage of his life. However, anyone with even a SHRED of common sense, knows you cannot think like the adult Manson and get away with it for long.
__label__2	"Manson Shows True Power Over His ""Family"": Manson shows it power and raps about his feelings over what really happend in 1969. In my opionion this book was chilling and addicting. If you want to witness the true power of manson and is words, read this book"
__label__2	A story with a nice twist that will leave you thinking: Mike Connors was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he is talking to Blue. Blue has something special to share with Mike, Blue is a serial kiler who is stalking the people of the small town where Mike lives. Blue wants to shre his thoughts and feelings with Mike, but Mike doesn't want to know. Mike is also making Blue angry - something that he really doesn't want to do. This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book.
__label__2	What's New Pussycat?: I first heard Miss Kittin (or Caroline Herve) on Felix Da Housecat's album `Kittenz and Thee Glitz' where her deadpan vocals dominated `Silver Screen Shower Scene', the best song on that album. She is also from that same electroclash scene as Chicks on Speed and Tiga.`I Com' is her second album and is more club-friendly then her previous outing. The beats are more in your face and her sense of irony is stronger, with track 2 `Requiem for a Hit' in particular standing out. First half of the album is excellent, it does takes some more listens to get into the second half. Another good reason for owning this album is the inclusion of the video for `Professional Distortion'. An album for the suicidegirls.com generation.
__label__1	Pretentious Drivel: People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this.
__label__1	so many good music out there, why wasting our time and money: As somebody else wrote earlier, it is so much great music out there that these I.Com tracks sound awfully poor and dry to me; maybe if that album would have appeared in the 90s it'd have sounded slightly more surprising, but just a few weeks before Björk releases Medulla, and definitely late after the Chicks on Speed albums (and without even 10% of their musical imagination) Miss Kittin with her new release is making electronic music sound like a joke, and conceived for people who never heard about Warp, Rephlex and the intelligent vast worlds of true electronica. To avoid.
__label__2	"Don't listen to that bad review!!: I thought twice about buying this because of that horrible review... SOOOO GLAD i got this cd now! Way better music and more singing less ""talking"" (talk/singing-samples). Miss kitten shows us that she can make more than electroclash and techno beats. Other than #2 (dance) and #4 (rock)this cd is more TRIP HOP than anything. While i would never compare it to baxter or dot allison I WOULD say many of those fans might like this. Much more intelligent and sad feeling than album 1, not as dancy."
__label__2	Ms Kittin, always on the cutting edge.: I have been waiting a long time for this record and although I love Miss Kittin, I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Radio Caroline 1. Although the beats and transitions are not as smooth(as in the former), the cd is good, and its apparent that Miss kittin is exploring her german side.This album's nature as cutting edge electronic music emerges after a couple of listens.
__label__1	anthology: This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read. I do not knowingly purchase anthol;ogies. O would not recomend this book unless yoy want all 3 books in one.
__label__1	Beware, this isn't a new book.: I was pretty disappointed when I purchased this book because I thought it was the next book in the series. Instead it is just a compilation of the previous 3 books one after another.
__label__1	"Cheating: David Weber uses a trick in this book that I think is cheating at writing, and not in a good way. One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle ""fantastic""."
__label__2	Three Great Books in One!: Empire From the Ashes tells a great story. This reprint worth buying if you don't already own the three paperback versions. Where's the fourth book? I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for.
__label__2	the nay-sayers are nuts: I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy.
__label__2	Talk about Twists and turns...: It was a pretty good Sci Fi book. When taken as a series, there are some great twists and turns. I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about. There is a theory on how the human race came to earth, as well as a war going on in space unknown to those on earth. I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story.
__label__2	What an enjoyable read.: One of the Best Books for an introduction to Sci/fi writing. When I first read this book years ago I said that to a friend of mine, and it still holds true today. One of the very few books i will read over again every year or two. Thankfully its just as good then as well. If you want an enjoyable read, that leaves you smiling at the end this is it.
__label__2	How many times have I read this?: I really don't know.Just finished re-reading it again, and still cried in parts, and was still left with a broad smile at the very end. (Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it. (I'm paraphasing).That is truly disappointing, because although I love most of his other books (I stopped reading Honor at about 12), this is his best work.Oh well...I only have to wait 5 more months for the next Merlin book.
__label__2	"Fun but feels like an outline: While I couldn't put it down - I feel like I just finished a LONG outline. Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say ""what if"".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds. But I certainly appreciate the classic scifi visions."
__label__2	Good stoner blues: It's about time that stoner rock acknowledged it's british blues/blues-rock/psychedelic/acid rock/hard rock roots. Good riffs, nice bluesey vocals, that's all I gotta say.
__label__2	Great Ep: this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide
__label__1	huh?: Why would I choose to listen to this when I already own every Black Sabbath album, and every Blue Chear album? I mean-it sounds like a cover band pretty much. But they will fare well in a music industry that does not favor creativity over a fashionable rehash. Such is life.
__label__1	"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT: I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED! I emailed Farm & Home Supply Center for a ""RGA Number"" to return these clippers and never got one. I'll keep them but I'm not happy.If you want a straight cutting blade toenail clipper, these are not the ones. Get the Tweeezerman ones."
__label__2	"One of the Top Ten for any Gnostic Library: THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from ""New Age"" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism. This book is a MUST READ for any serious student of the origins and practices of Gnostic Philosophy.Gospel of Judas and Other Gnostic Secrets Revealed"
__label__1	FRUSTRATED!: I had TWO of these products sent to me and BOTH of them were inoperatable and the packaging on one of them was open...ughhhh...VERY disappointed not to mention frustrated!
__label__1	Great For First Timers: While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers.
__label__2	"THE book on this unique style: If you are researching illumination of Spanish Codex and manuscripts this is the book to have. There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in ""The Illuminated Manuscripts..."" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form."
__label__1	Thoughts on A Modern Magician: Sadly both A Modern Magician & it's sequel A Calculated Magic have not aged well. They both feel very 80's
__label__1	Amerock BP26127-2-ORB Oversized Manor Knob 2-Inch ...: I had an unusual time trying to get this product. Recieved wrong item. Never did get what I wanted.
__label__2	An extremely good picture book.: The photos of the book are breathtaking and the book gives a good overview of Celtic art spanning the Celtic period. However the reader should bear in mind that the book is not comprehensive. Books available in German such as the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series give one a glimpse as to how wildly creative the Celts were especially in all of the art in general of Hallstatt period and of the variety of of styles found on fibula in the La Tene period. I highly recommend one with a serious interest in Celtic art to continue to search for more source material in addition to this book. However if one were to own one book as an overview of Celtic art I would recommend this book as one of the books to have.
__label__1	Pet Groomer: I believe the pet groomer would be better if it were smaller as it is difficult to hold. The pin brush head bristles are too hard. The large head makes the suction too strong for my dogs comfort. (I have 8 dogs from 10# to 90#)
__label__1	nothing new and not a lot of meat: There isn't anything new to be found in this text that hasn't been covered more thoroughly in other texts. The topics covered seemed glossed over without any meat or substance. Skip this one for more up to date books.
__label__1	Book to basic: This book was very disapointing, and misleading. Like for example wing chun has no high kicks but you will see one in this book. enough said
__label__2	Another fun Rudy Maxa DVD: We have enjoyed all of the Rudy Maxa DVD travel series, especially in BluRay. The programs help when viewed prior to travel and are most enjoyable post-travel. Rudy captures and best of every location. He also enjoys food and beverage, which we appreciate in our household.
__label__1	very poor: would not buy it.Not worth the money.Did not tell me all the things that I could see in the cities.Would not recommend to anyone.
__label__2	Best of Travel: San Francisco Seattle Vancouver: The video quality is outstanding. Watching this video gives the viewer a glimpse of 3 very interesting cities as seen by Rudy Maxa. The video definitely entices the viewer to want to visit these cities. It is a great travel video.
__label__2	Excellent novel with a different focus: Venus Johnson seems to have is going on. SHe has a good career, a doctor for a boyfriend and long pretty hair. But she is not happy. Venus decides to make some changes and the first thing to go is the boyfriend, then the hair. Cutting off the hair is not easy. As any black woman can tell you, its hard being a slave to the hair. You know the horror stories, of the pressing comb, perms, and hours at the hair salon, but it seems your hair can dictate your self worth. This was happening with Venus. It was fun to read the reactions of others to her new look, new attitude. I found this book to be very interesting. THe characters were funny, interesting and someone you know you already know. It was also encouraging to watch Venus come to terms with herself, her life and her relationships. This was a very interesting read. One I highly recommend
__label__2	"More than just hair: The author is smart. If you name a book, ""Nappily Ever After"" you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean."
__label__2	"Kept my interest: ""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"
__label__2	Entertaining and informative: Venus is a sista that has it going on in every way. She has a good job, live in boyfriend and long pretty hair. Out the blue one day, Venus goes to the beauty salon and instructs her stylist to cut her hair off then she sends her boyfriend on his way. Wonder what cause this? Venus is in search of her independence. This is an outstanding debut. God's Blessing's to the author.
__label__1	"Uneven: While the author does a good job of illustrating the personal ""good hair vs. bad hair"" trauma of black girls everywhere (myself included), too much of this novel is bogged down in romance novel cliches to make the overall plot resonate."
__label__1	Disappointed: I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters.
__label__1	a very poor attempt!!: This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards. Those who said it was great, I don't suppose you read much or you only read these types of books. This book is very sad and doesn't deserve the praise it gets.
__label__1	"... Ever After: C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about ""cutting off"" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."
__label__2	Not exactly what I expected........: but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair.
__label__2	thought provoking: I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction.
__label__2	Well written and kinda true!!!: This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.
__label__2	Very good book!: This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf.
__label__2	NItty Gritty-This book gets to it...: Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one.
__label__2	Cute! Light reading but a lot of fun.: For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun.
__label__2	Kept me glued.: Nappily Ever Afer was an outstanding book. I couldn't put the book down for two day's straight. Khandi reminded me of a lot of black women I know, beatiful but very insecure about them selves. I was very glad to see Venius found herself at the end. I couldn't understand for the love of me why a woman would want to force a man to marry her the way she did. I guess I learned a thing a two about the way women think when reading Venus' thoughts. This was a very intresting book, I'll be looking forward to reading the author's next novel.
__label__2	It's the message: This is all about the message. The madman, The lighthouse keeper. I know it all sounds strange and all that, but listen to the words. It may just give you hope!
__label__1	Very, very cute.: If you like cute. It's okay, but you have to waid througha lot of syrupy, cloying, well, Canadianess. This stuffwould be great on Sesame Street.
__label__1	Bad Muslim: There are many good Muslims. Unfortunately, the author, Mr. Mamdani is not one of them. He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich
__label__1	Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: This book was a very poorly written effort in my opinion. Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University. Instead of wasting his time here, he needs to return to his own country for the purpose of educating his own people.
__label__1	Good idea, bad execution: This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others.
__label__2	"Absolutely AWESOME!: Usually I write a review only if I dislike something about a book. I rarely bother to write good reviews, because every book gets so many of them. In this case, however, I have to make an exception. For any fan of hard science fiction, ""Pushing Ice"" is AWESOME! It's got everything: realistic characters, solid physics and astronomy, believable near-future society (circa 2050), glimpses of far future society (circa 20,000 A.D.), some REALLY far future, aliens which are somewhat comprehensible, aliens which are completely beyond comprehension, rivalry, broken friendships, betrayal, marooning in space (on multiple levels), struggle for survival, etc. Even asteroid mining and that perennial ""stranded in space"" trick - using electric motors as generators :)"
__label__1	Boring Characters: I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?
__label__1	Boring Ice: I usually enjoy the thrill of grand space operas. No suspense in this one though. Everything was totally predictable. The conflict between Svetlana and Bella was tedious; the aliens were somehow uninspired. I enjoyed a couple of his other books, but this one was far too long and uneventful.
__label__1	"Confusing: Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."
__label__2	Enjoyable and mind-expanding: Enjoyable ride through time from modern ages to the far far future of the universe. The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies.
__label__2	Very impressive: This is the best scifi novel I have read for a while, goes above and beyond the author's revelation space series. It has real characters, good description of spaceflight in the next few decades, a mystery which really shocked me when revealed (didn't see that coming), plus big ideas and revalations about intelligent life in the universe. Everything fits together perfectly, highly recommended.
__label__2	"Space Opera it isn't...it's better than that: I've read Century Rain before this and thought that it was a rather average experience.Pushing Ice however had me absolutely hooked. Like other reviewers, I'll grant to have seen better character interaction elsewhere, but as alvays with good SF, it's really all about the setting and the plotline, and as a first encounter novel this ranks among the best.If you've enjoyed Peter Hamilton - the current master of Space Opera - but found him a bit long-winded and liked Arthur C. Clarke, but found him a bit too nerdy, you might give this one a try.It's been a while since I've had a reading experience that really made me loose myself to the story, but ""Pushing Ice"" did the trick. And then in one volume....IMO, there's too much crap in the space opera genre. Insofar this can be considered space opera - which I really don't think it is - this is definately a gold nugget."
__label__2	By a true scientist!: An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad
__label__2	Enjoyable Read: Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle.
__label__2	Turn on to this radio book.: A wonderful pictorial book about transistor radios, 175 of them, not only photographed but put in the context of fifties and sixties design. The spread on 60-61 shows six radios mixed with close-up photos of chrome styling from fifties cars. I loved the chapter on design with its photos of grills and lettering, even a spread on 9-volt batteries.This is the kind of book that Chronicle do so well, interesting subjct, well designed and printed all for the general reader. If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide. For that have a look at 'Collector's Guide to Transistor Radios' by Marty and Sue Bunis, plenty of text about seven hundred models, some photos and that all-important identification and price information.
__label__1	"The Album Cover Picture is incorrect: The album cover picture for this page is incorrect. See other offerings of ""Spanish Eyes"" by Paul McDermand for the correct image.The music is wonderful, however!!!!"
__label__2	Amazing book on Life!: When Reich wrote this book in the early 50's He was supposed to have gone mad. After a first read of the book, you will find He was unusually lucid, much more than Nietzsche himself in the account of a Life ruling principle.Do not be afraid of any comment. Just enjoy reading it!
__label__2	a must read book!!!: heavy to read!! still worth it to get to understand how institutions and the masses function over individual persons willing to change our paradigms!!
__label__1	translation: Even thou I enjoyed the art, the book wasn't in english. I wanted to read and understand about the art, to bad.
__label__1	Beware of the size of this book!: Beware of the size of this book!If you are expecting to receive a regular size art book, you will be extremely disappointed. The book measures 7.5 x 9 inch and is thinner than my pinky finger.However, if you are just interested in the content, there is a lot to look at and to read.
__label__2	My Dali Introduction: Dali is a great beginner's book to him. I love his art, but am not really a huge or knowledgeable art fan.Chock full of pictures and a little history it was a great buy. No I know what the names of his art is and can start looking for his prints.
__label__2	Dali is DA MAN: This book is awesome! Dali is no doubt one of the greatest artists of the 20th century! Smoked some bud too no doubt!! hehe
__label__1	Art of Dali: I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.
__label__2	Everything You Want From Dali and More: This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time.
__label__2	excellent: in addition to providing many details about Dali's life, his relationship with Breton and the surrealists, his friendship with Picasso and so on, the book provides the reader with an excellent discussion/analysis/explanation of Dali's artistic/aesthetic choices and of his 'paranoiac-critical method'.This seems to be the definitive book on Dli's paintings.
__label__2	So far So good!: I have an office that is a decent size, on the smaller size- but has a very large window and thin walls so it is arctic cold at times. I purchased this heater based on the reviews and the remote control...the remote is great, as is the safety feature. I have only had it a couple of days, but so far I am very happy. I have the thermostat cranked up as high as it will go and the heater on the highest setting and its so quiet I can barely tell its running. My office heats up so quickly my coworkers have been stopping by to warm up!FYI: if the safety button on the back is not pushed in, your heater won't operate. I thought mine was broken until I found this out...
__label__2	This is a nice portable heater,for the office,or den..Is quiet,and good for spot heating.: This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated...
__label__2	Fantastic thermostatic operation!: This is a fantastic seemingly small heater. But it is a mighty one!!!This heater comfortably warms my main basement room which is approx. 25 feet x 25 feet. I leave it on the medium setting and the thermostat works excellent: the heater does not stay on constantly. The heat temp rises to a nice warm, toasty level; shuts off and when it gets a little chilled, goes right back on. The best heater I have bought! I went thru 4 heaters last winter till I finally found this one that is still functioning!!!
__label__1	Jerry Bernstein..DeLonghi Safe Heat heater #DFH550R: ON/OFF button extremely hard to work, maybe broke. Numbers on temp dial very hard to read. Once you get it going, it works OK.
__label__1	"extremely poor product / non-existent customer service: this DeLonghi DFH550R heater is an extremely poor product and the customer service is non-existent,doesn't have a physical address or phone number and never gives their names...buyer beware...read their absolutely ridiculous return policy before buying...if you open any package they won't take it back...if you write a truthful negative feedback, they'll be after you like "" ticks on a hound "" !!!"
__label__2	Beautiful Hair: This makes dull hair look fresh. It's not too much- it's perfect. I highly recommend it for those days when your hair can look somewhat dull- like in between coloring.
__label__1	Poor sound quality: The transfer to digital format from the analog source includes all of the tape hiss on this disc. The content is great, but the background noise is too much on my system. I'd look for another title from OP and pass on this one.
__label__1	Complex controls don't come on after power outage: I bought this to keep the inside of my RV from freezing up during the week (we use it on weekends). After a power-outage of about 30 minutes, the unit failed to come back on so everything froze up. Since we are prone to brief outages, this was not acceptable. I replaced the Delonghi with a $20 space-heater and have not had another problem.
__label__1	Yes, just ok: I bought these at Target too. Yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. The handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. Yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. But if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, I have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. And if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. My other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so I can use the hand mixer. There's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them.
__label__2	White Plastic Kitchen Bowl Set is amazing!: I truly love cooking with these bowls. The surface makes clean-up easy and the depth allows for me to throw an unlimited amount of concoctions into it. These bowls and strong and sturdy so that they will last forever and take all the wear and tear of cooking and the dishwasher. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product.
__label__1	Stained after two uses: I bought these. After two uses (the first being a french vanilla cake, and the second fudge brownies), they stained from the brownie batter and will not come clean. I figured these would be better quality, since they ARE kitchen aid.
__label__1	TERRIBLE!!!!: I had these bowls on my wedding registry and my sister in law ordered them for me. The first time they came, they were all broken and cracked. We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!
__label__1	Just ok...: I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better.
__label__2	"Compilation of ballads (with a great late night feel): This volume is a compilation of ballads taken from albums Joe Henderson recorded in the period 1992 to 1997. The music is supurb - Henderson almost whispers through his saxophone - and provides the perfect setting for a pleasant evening. Those who seek a late night CD look no further! Those who wish to explore Henderson's work of the nineties in more detail should consider buying (one of) the albums used for this compilation: ""Lush Life"", ""So Near, So Far"", ""Double Rainbow"", or ""Porgy & Bess""."
__label__1	Poor Quality: Just bought this toy for my son's birthday. The tower is very top heavy and won't stand up. They give you adhesive strips to stick to your wall/window. If the box wasn't torn by my son this would definetly be returned.
__label__1	Cool, but not durable: My little brother just got this for his birthday. It's cool, but will probably be broken in a few days. The pieces that stick to the wall fall off alot. No action figures come with it either. And the bottom half is made of cardboard too--not cool.
__label__1	Frustrating: My son received this for his birthday and my normally laid back and quite handy husband was never so frustrated in his life putting a toy together. After the 3 or 4 hour labor of putting the thing together the toy would not work properly and my 3 year old son kept crying because he couldn't get the doors or elevators to work. Overall it was a terrible experience and we can't even get the thing back in the box to return it.
__label__1	Falls apart very easily: I bought this for my 6 year old son and it is very unstable. It falls apart way to easily. We have to lean it up against the wall so he can play with it and it still falls down.
__label__1	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.
__label__1	Don't waste your money!: This was a real disappointment. It is incredibly flimsy and poorly made. Will never hold up to its intended play.
__label__1	Please Don't Buy this Toy: My son loves Batman and was looking forward to playing with this toy. My son is very bright and we could not figure out how to put this toy together properly. It kept falling apart and the directions were very confusing. Please do not waste your money. I wasted 45 dollars on a toy that I couldn't even put together!
__label__1	Might be OK if your child is older: My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. We got it for him and it was pretty frustrating. The parts kept falling off and the elevator has NEVER worked. For 2 days straight he played with it, broke every piece off practically, and came crying to mommy to every few minutes. That was 6 months ago. He pretty much hasn't played with it since. Too bad because he's such a batman freak.Maybe he was just too young for it. If you're buying it for a younger child...beware!
__label__1	"I've been had!: This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
__label__1	What a waste!: This toy is a disaster. Who ever heard of a toy that you had to tape to the wall to balance. Every time it moves, it falls over or falls apart. This is the last time I will ever buy this type of toy. The worst part is the look of disappointment on my son's face the first time he tried to play with this. You people should be ashamed, it's like stealing our money at our children's expense!!!
__label__1	worst toy ever: I bought this toy for my 4 year old for Christmas and all you have to do is touch it and the pieces fall off. Durability is not even a consideration for this toy. I have never wasted my money on a worse toy than this. I really wanted the other bat cave listed but it is out of production...scary thing is that this is what they replaced it with. Do yourself a favor, don't waste the money I did!!!!
__label__1	This toy is not worth the money: I sure wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn't believe how flimsy this toy is. There is no way he could even play with it. Everytime we tried to move it, it fell apart! I am very disappointed and do not recommend.
__label__1	"Fun if you can get it to stand up for any lenght of time: This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH"""
__label__2	Batcave a good buy!: My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money.
__label__1	Catastrophe Cave!: The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy.
__label__1	Great idea, poorly engineered: Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!
__label__1	DO NOT BOTHER: This is toy so frustrating. Very hard to put together and even harder to get the working parts to work without the entire thing falling apart! My son loves batman and this was a gift from his Grammy so he is using it but I had to mount is to a special board to keep from falling into pieces and then tape it together! By next week it will find the dumpster. Waste of time and money and worse yet truly frustrating for my 5 year old..
__label__2	Imagination at its BEST!: Yes, this item may be a little tippy. But find a way to attach it temporarily to a wall and it stays just fine. My son plays with this all the time! It is great! He pretends with his Batman, Superman, Spiderman toys and uses his imagination to capture the bad guys! It is a very cool toy and well worth the money.
__label__1	WORST TOY EVER!: After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!
__label__1	Fun, But Falls Apart: I bought this toy for my son's fourth birthday in September. I did not have problems putting the toy together and initially my son loved it. He and his friends played for hours and hours. The arms and ropes, etc. led to a lot of imaginative play. However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck. Also, the elevator was not big enough or offitted to hold the Batman figures, so when my son would put a figure in the elevator, it inevitably would fall over and jam the elevator. We've already thrown the toy out, a few months later.
__label__1	Batcave - get in touch with mattel: Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster. I paid around 39 for it and see it's now retailing for 9. It just doesn't work. It's a pathetic toy. However I got in touch with Mattel and on the second attempt (they didn't respond first time or didn't get my e-mail) they phoned to offer me a choice of replacement toys. Hope everyone here has done this or will do it - complaining is the only way toy manufacturers will learn.
__label__1	BATMAN TOYS NEEDS BETTER QUALITY: I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. This one of many Batman toys my 6 year old son has, every 5 minutes he comes to me to put the toy back together agian. (I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away! Plus there are three pices to this toy that would fall off as soon as I put on that we didn't need anyway.
__label__1	Very Disappointed ...: Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise.
__label__1	Waste of money: Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic... flimsy and not durable. Can not get the elevator to work properly always jams up. This toy won't last to long.
__label__1	"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave: Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
__label__1	JUNK: MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
__label__1	Batcave Warning!!! Caution!!!: WARNING!!! CAUTION!!! Parents do not waste your hard earned money or valuable time with this toy. I am the proud father of two boys who were so excited to receive this batcave from Santa. Boy were they disappointed with the substandard quality. This has to be the worst display of a children's toy that I have seen in awhile. I feel that Mattel has stolen from me by misrepresenting this gypsy junk as an actual toy. Please do not purchase!
__label__1	BAT GUANA!: This thing is a major piece of junk. It doesn't stick to the wall like it claims. You have to stand to play with it (cause all the cool stuff is at the top), and the extension pieces constantly fall off. I actually screwed it to the wall, but that lasted a whole 10 minutes as it wouldn't stay screwed into the wall. Then the scenery kept falling. Save your money and buy the cool batmobile or something.
__label__1	Wrong Bruce, you idiots!: Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!
__label__1	"Mattel + Batman = JUNK TOYS!: Just ""assembled"" the bat cave for my 5 year old. Pathetic construction and workmanship -- half of the gimmics don't work. Another pile of injection-molded plastic parts and stickers that I get to assemble -- what is this thing -- $4 of raw materials + $2 of shipping + $10 of marketing? Garbage. Shame on you Mattel, the only thing worse is the batman figures with the batarangs that take 30 minutes and a blowtorch to get out of the packaging. This batcave will collapse and die within hours of play, I'm sure of it. GARBAGE!"
__label__1	Fun For a Few Minutes, Until it needs fixing AGAIN!!: My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money.
__label__1	a monumental waste of money: I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!
__label__1	Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing: We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!
__label__1	Good Concept. VERY VERY Flimsy: I got this for my 5 year old. I loved the concept, unfortunatley I never seen such a flimsy toy. We had to super glue everything together because pieces would fall off, this is because there are no snaps to keep levels in place but rather just fits together. Would not buy this toy!!!!!!!!!!! Would not recommend this toy unless your willing to super glue all parts!
__label__1	POOR QUALITY: I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!
__label__1	Don't Buy The Batcave: My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
__label__1	Flimsy...not worth the effort!: Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly.
__label__1	"Save Your Money: I have previously purchased a Ross Berstein book (""Gopher Hockey by the Hockey Gopher"") and found that to be an entertaining read. Not so with this offeringAll Berstein seems to have done is find some of Herb's friends, turned on his tape recorder and then transcibe their comments, verbatim. The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same. There were a few pictures of young Herbie the player. Those are fairly interesting, but I found myself a little disappointed with this offering."
__label__1	I wish it were a better book: In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight.
__label__2	Thrilled! And Warm!: I bought this to help heat a bath off my master bedroom. It works like a charm I run it for twenty minutes prior to hopping into the shower and no more shivering!
__label__1	Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate: My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!
__label__1	"Unacceptable: The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"
__label__1	Keep looking if you want a portable mixer: I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. It fails miserably as it produces so much hiss it is unusable. I mean it is poor with a captital P.The phantom power does not work when in battery mode, nor does the clipping LED's. Keep on looking if you want portability.
__label__2	10 Channel Mixer: I bought this mixer for my husband off his wish list. He was very excited and loves it!!!!!
__label__2	What's not to like?: Easy to read yet scholarly. Great illustrations. Space in the margins for notes. Good chapter overviews and summaries. Nice T/F questions to prime the reader. Sources used appropriately. It is truly the ideal textbook.The format, layout, and writing style make this the text that other writers should follow.
__label__1	take a different class: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous.
__label__1	Attempts at Classification: I'm not sold on social psychology. Part of my issue with this discipline is my personal fight to never let people pigeon-hole me and this seems to want to it on a grand scale. Some of the text does not help one see how issues of individual psychological development tie in to the study of social psychology. This is a great failing because many people no very little about this topic.
__label__1	waste of money: the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price.
__label__2	Outstanding Book: From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric

__label__1	might be a good scanner: my scanner hasn't worked since the day i took it out of the box, installed the software, and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing! looks like it's a dud. lol.
__label__1	"Crap, Crap, Crap!!!: There is no other way to put it. All Visioneers are garbage. Purchased my 2nd one (after first one died for no reason after a year) and have experienced many problems. Lately it won't let me scan anything because of an error saying to ""unlock your scanner"". There is no Freakin lock on the darn thing!!! After contacting the company many many times (btw - there customer service sucks! - No telephone number, unless u pay $2 per minute, just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA). I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau, there response was that they couldn't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase, but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25% off of their price (which was probably an elevated price). I told them to kiss off! Anyway - please don't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck!"
__label__1	Don't buy this scanner: I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook's USB port. The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I've owned over the years, which is easy to use. However after only a few hundred scans, there's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened, resulting in a very poor scan. I'm throwing it away. Buy something else.
__label__1	Do Not Buy This Scanner: Absolutely the worst software for flatbed scanner I have ever encountered. Scan is slow and softcover lousy. Don't buy
__label__1	Intentional Obsolescence -- 2011 and it still no drivers!: Vista has been out for 4 years, I'm up to Windows 7, and they still haven't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what's called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?
__label__1	It doesnt work with Vista: The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality.
__label__1	Save yourself the trouble: I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk.
__label__1	Don't buy this scanner: I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product. If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!
__label__2	Forget The Hype! This is a Great Record!: Forget that Capitol records killed this band's career by letting the public believe that Klaatu was the Beatles secretly reunited (shame on them)! Forget that the name of this band was taken from a Sci-Fi movie (Like Duran Duran didn't do the same?)! Forget that The Carpenters covered thier best known song! Just forget all that junk, and LISTEN TO THE RECORD! YES! LISTEN! This band should have been BIG! It's sad that they only gained a cult following. There are so many fine elements on this record. Who cares about ths stinking singles charts? Who said good music had to be POPULAR? This is just a great LP. It has stood the test of time, and made it to CD. Thank god somebody in the industry recognizes a classic LP when they hear one. So, they weren't the Beatles...they never claimed to be. And Who Cares? Just Listen to the record. It speaks for itself.
__label__2	real life hero: just as good now as when i bought the album when it first came out. good diversity in the music. This album was originally thought to be the Beatles reformed.
__label__2	"Klaatu: It was a replacement for the one that was ""stolen"" by my now ""ex"" about ten years ago...The replacememt was in excellent condition and it was just as good (or even better) than the one that was taken...Klaatu was a innnovative band...It's a shamethey didn't catch on well here.."
__label__2	"Beatle mutation music at it's pop cosmic best!: ""Subrosa Subway"" hooked me right in. ""Calling Occupants"" a masterpiece. No one thought it could be done...the Beatles sound in an experimental way, but my goodness, an attention and care to arranging was astounding. No mop top hype to hide behind.The fact that they wanted it released with no individual song credits made it feel like a group effort. As they wanted no one to look at the album in none other way than an experience. And they the achieved with flying colours. This album is the reason I even got into songwriting or noticed songwriting as an art form.Indeed a special album for me all time."
__label__2	HELL'S Yeah!: This live recording of Incantation IS a must own. Very few copies were put into circulation and I picked up my copy via amazon's used marketplace a few weeks ago. I love their studio albums and this live album is outstanding. The drums sound great as well as the production values. A must own.
__label__2	Small and mighty.: Not since Johnathan Livingston Seagull have we had a book that speaks to the power and beauty of a small bird. Iridescent Soul's main character is the hummingbird, but its message is for the human soul.It is beautiful, light, transcendent, and hopeful. A great gift!
__label__1	Terrible Picture Quality: Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage.
__label__2	"Growing Up Elsewhere: A former ""diplobrat"" who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden's description of a child's first encounter with France. The effect of their foreign adventure on each family member develops along with an excellent plot (not usually Godden's strong point). Even better than the character descriptions is the evocation of French country life at its most seductive -- ""next best to being there."""
__label__1	Did not like: Just not my type of book. Very boring but I got through it. Hard to stick with it until the end.
__label__2	Just what I wanted: Thanks for providing me with an oldie but goodie. The Greengage Summer came to me in great condition for an older book.
__label__1	Fine for children, boring for adults: One has to be a young adult to enjoy this book. If you want to read about children in a foreign country without adult supervision, well, there you have it. I'm surprised it wasn't turned into a Disney movie.Definitely a children's book.
__label__1	"Does not work for Ipod connectivity on PC's: Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed. Installed the card in a snap without incident. Tried connecting my Ipod and it immediately started charging so I thought I was good. However, I opened itunes and nothing. Went to the iogear website thinking i needed to update the driver when I stumbled across the statement on the Tech Support Library, document #10162:""Why won't my IPod work with the GUF320?Both the IPod and mini-IPod require a Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) certified card to connect to the computer. At this time, the GUF320 is not WHQL certified.We apologize for any inconvenience.""Well that would have been nice to know before I ordered the card and wasted my time and effort."
__label__1	USB ports won't work with iPod: Bought this card to use with an iPod, and was greatly disappointed. My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports, and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods. I had to go buy an additional cable (iPod to Firewire) in order to get my iPod working. The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod, but you'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you.
__label__2	Plug and Go Go Go!!: No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me....
__label__1	Not G5 Compatible: Though the description states this card will work with G3 and above it wont even fit in the PCI slot for a G5 1.8 Single or a1.8 Dual I belive its because those slots are PCI-X. I am going to try the Sonnet alegro which says it will work with a G5 also. We'll see.The Sonnet alegro works!
__label__1	Bad quality: Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.
__label__2	good value, works like a charm!: This card installed without a hitch on my Dell Dimension with Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2). It wasn't even necessary to install any drivers; Windows simply detected the new FireWire and USB devices and installed them without prompting.The device works great. I noticed a huge increase in transfer speeds coming off my USB 2.0 capable digital camera (my Dell came stocked with USB 1.1 only).I would definitely recommend this PCI card!
__label__1	Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair: I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars.
__label__1	Does not work with PowerMac G5: Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher, this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5.(...)
__label__2	Rockin' In Rhythm...: I listened to the first track, Rockin' In Rhythm five or six times before going onto the second track; and experienced the delight of discovering something truly good and remarkable from two artists, about whom I thought I knew everything good and remarkable. Back in the 1970's I collected Ella songbooks on vinyl (Gershwin, Porter, Rogers & Hart), but never got around to the Ellington collection. How fortunate that I inadvertently saved this little gem for a rainy day. Listening to it is like discovering Ellington and Ella anew. Except with the added appreciation of a fan. I would never tire of Rockin' In Rhythm, so reliable a source of joy it is...my soul smiles for the privilege to witness this collaboration.
__label__1	Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.
__label__2	not immoral: this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid.
__label__2	Truly and excellent book.: Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia.
__label__2	A wonderful tale!: This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time.
__label__2	Not for those looking for an uplifting read.: I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it.
__label__2	Much more action oriented than other Clavell work.: Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving.
__label__2	Clavell has done it again. His style expands into the 1900s: This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable.
__label__2	"A significant change from Noble House Saga: A very good read, this novel is more ""complex"" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering ""what the point was the novel trying to get across?"" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."
__label__1	"Not all that profound after all: I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."
__label__1	Disapointing: After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )
__label__1	"Reads like a book for 8 to 12 year olds: I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"
__label__1	Couldn't get into it.: I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment.
__label__1	king rat: the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl
__label__2	A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along.
__label__2	An unforgettable journey!: In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart.
__label__2	"Great Book and Series: Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series. Just wish they had the Last and Final book in the Series which was ""Whirlwind"" when I was ready for it."
__label__2	Great book if you are into WWII history of the Pacific: After living in Singapore for seven years, I read a lot on the war in the pacific.This is one of my favorites. Though fictional, it captured what I saw and read about the Japanese occupation.Clavel is the one of the best.
__label__2	Outstanding!: If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House.
__label__2	Really liked the book: When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much
__label__1	Disappointing: This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people.
__label__1	below par: after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it.
__label__2	"Quick, interesting, and accurate: This is different from the ""Asian Saga"" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way."
__label__1	Numbers Peg puzzle: This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background.
__label__2	My son loves it!: My son learned his numbers so quickly with the help of this puzzle. He loves all of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and I figured this would be great to help him learn his numbers. I was right! Great present! Highly recommended!
__label__2	Great buy!: You cant go wrong with these puzzles! My son loves to play with them and discover whats under the puzzle pieces. It helps a child develop number recognition which is so important. Very well made and durable! SOmething I will surely save for the next generation.
__label__2	Colorful, durable AND educational!: I bought this for my great nephew - 18 months old who is already learning to count and learn his colors. I also got him a dino puzzle by Melissa & Doug. Both items are really great. They are very durable and colorful so he likes playing with them and putting the shapes back in their places. The number puzzle is fun because when you take the number out, there are pictures under each number for example - take out the three - there are three turtles (I may have the wrong animal but you get the gist!!). His 3 year old cousin that visits often also loves playing with them so they have a good age range.
__label__2	cute: My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this puzzle. Perfect for learning numbers and counting. I would recommend for anyone with a toddler. Not so much for babies as I have found they end up chewing a ruining the pieces...
__label__2	"Best ""Toy"" Ever!: My 16 month old has been playing with this off and on for about a month, and she can now put every single number in the correct place every time without a second of hesitation! Because the numbers are written below each space, she now even recognizes the WORD for each number! Am I ordering the alphabet puzzle immediately."
__label__2	Numbers Puzzle: I bought this puzzle for my son because we can't afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC's, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I have nearly every educational puzzle that Melissa and Doug have put out and I love them all.
__label__2	I love these puzzles.: My almost 2yr old learned her numbers with this puzzle. It's wonderful and easy for little fingers. This is definately not a cheaply made puzzle.
__label__2	Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . .
__label__2	GREAT NUMBER BOARD: Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him. He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him. It's well built. Arrived in only a couple days. Our son loves it!!
__label__1	Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look: 1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect
__label__2	Excellent for my students: I teach mentally handicapped adults at a local community college, and if you want durable puzzles that your students can use over and over again, I strongly recommend getting puzzles like this. It's durable and can get students to focus their attention. Worth getting.
__label__2	Great Teaching Tool: This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers
__label__2	purchased for 2 yr. old: I purchased several puzzles from Melissa & Doug. They are beautifully made. I would recommend them. These will last a good, long time.
__label__2	"5 FOR ESTATE, 3 FOR THE REST: IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEW, I AM THE ONE THAT LEFT A COMMENT IN FAVOR, BUT WONDERING WHY THEY LEFT ONLY ONE STAR. IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE SHE GAVE IT A ""HAUNTING"" REVIEW, IF NOT TOO SHORT. THE TUNE: 'ESTATE' IS WITH OUT A DOUBT A FIVE STAR TUNE. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JAZZ VOCAL NUMBERS I CAN REMEMBER HEARING. HOWEVER, THE REST OF THE CD, I FEEL FALLS FAR SHORT OF ESTATE. ALL OF THE MUSIC IS SOFT AND NICE, BUT JUST DIDN'T GRAB ME PERSONALLY. REGARDLESS, YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE NICE QUIET BACKGROUND FOR DINNER OR SLOW AND ALONE DANCING WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE."
__label__1	Summer-Estate: Anyone who hears this song and isn't mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. I heard it in my car and almost wrecked. The most beautiful!
__label__1	Question: Why does it look as though the same person wrote all seven of the reviews above? Kind of odd, huh?
__label__1	"A waste of time: This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."
__label__1	"Amazon needs to sort out Weinstock and Huneker: This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called ""Chopin: The Man And His Music"". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."
__label__1	Not what expected: As a Noni user for many years, when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni. When it arrived was disappointed to see not PURE Noni juice, but rather adulterated Noni with fruit juice. I use NONI not for the taste, but the health benefits, yes NONI tastes bad, but I want the benefit of the NONI not additives to make it taste better. Can't recommend this product.
__label__2	Simple, clear and solidly dogmatic: This is a traditional Catholic study guide book of the Mass of the Angels.The book, though primarily for teachers and suchlike, might very well today do as a text book. Because so much has been lost or is just not taught anymore. It is so well written, and so full of quiet inspiration that a good deal of it could be used for reading aloud in church on suitable occasions.Altogether - quite a find!
__label__2	"Pure genius!: This is the one of the few books of poetry I've read that actually means something! Discovering this has really changed the way I think about verse and books in general. The best thing about it? NOT boring. I'm so sick of the innocuous, adjectival, over-written, meaningless poems in so many journals and ""literary"" magazines of our time. David Trinidad is smart--read for pure pleasure, and then read again and look for the subtle tricks and talent he employs to make these poems truly great art! Truly fresh, too. No one else is writing about our tarnished culture like Trinidad. He is truly unique, and like I said, the best compliment I can give is that this book is not a bore--something that 98% of all books of poetry these days are! Thank you Mr. Trinidad! You've got me reading and enjoying poetry again!"
__label__2	"If you like Douglass, you'll like this: Good stuff from the great freedom fighter. Rarely known texts are included with the famous ""Narrative."" ""The Condition of the Freedmen"", a look at African-Americans 20 years after the end of slavery, provide some sobering thoughts for American Blacks today. ""The Heroic Slave"" tells the little-known true story of Madison Washington, who led a slave ship called ""The Creole"" into freedom in 1841. I would also recommend ""The frederick Doulgass Reader"" and ""The Life and Times of Frederick Doulgass"" to make your ""Dougology"" complete!"
__label__1	Frontin': Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. Plus the guy can't sing he sounds like he is whining. Stay away from this song!!
__label__2	"MAD HOT FRIED BLOCK PARTY-TYPE MUSIC: THIS BE HOT! NOBODY CAN TOUCH PHARRELL! THIS BE HOT! I'VE ONLY HEARD ""FRONTIN'"" THOW. AIN'T NO THING! WHOOP WHOOP!"
__label__1	It's not the greatest song: I love the neptunes and almost everything done by them has struck me as gold, but this song is not that great. Pharrell can sing ok, but the beats is their forte. And this beat is nothing special at all. Just didn't do it for me. Also, they added the radio edit of Hott (cot) damn. The clean version of that track is stupid. Better off just listen to the real version on Lord Willin'. Not the best cd single compilation.
__label__1	"The Return of Randy Watson:""Sexual Chocolate"": I'll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now.but as far as Pharell thinking He is the 2nd-Coming of Curtis Mayfield? NAW!Double NAW!!!! Pharell has Radny Watson written all over Him Vocally to me.whenever I watch Pharell up there singing I have a ""Coming to America"" Flashback.but the scary part is that alot of folks are taking His Singing Career as legit."
__label__2	great insights into a world that few ever see: fantastic investigative reporting with compelling analysis. as easy to read as a good spy thriller and as informative as a good textbook. valuable reading for anyone interested in Japanese finance and the relationship between bureaucrats, politicians, and business.read the first chapter on amazon.com and you'll be hooked.
__label__1	no product: I am unable to review this product as the item NEVER arrived and I ended up with a refund.Will be looking for another source, and trying to order it again.If and when I finally do get the item I will let you know what I think about it then.
__label__2	Best introduction to its subject that I know of: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary.
__label__2	A great book~: This book has great myths. At first, it seems boring, but soon your eyes will be glued onto the pages. It is a wonderful book to share around to your classmates and teachers. Each story has a morel that teaches you well on a situation. I recommend this to people around the teens.
__label__2	"Informational: This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."
__label__2	Great book - a good introduction to Greek mythology: I purchased this book for my 9 year old son as a companion book to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. He completely devoured it in three days - the illustrations are bold and the stories are dramatic/gruesome enough to capture his interest (without being too horrible or nightmare-inducing). We are finding that knowing a bit about the legends behind the constellations makes stargazing that much more enjoyable. I would recommend this book for boys and girls 8-10 years old, although I admit I enjoyed reading it, too!
__label__2	"Children like this book: My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
__label__2	A early favorite: Greek Gods and Heroes is one of the better books on mythology for children out thare, with great pictures and easy to understand stories that people of all ages can enjoy. As a child it was my favorite book in the school library and I checked it out over and over again. It is a must have for any fan of the greek gods and the myths about them.
__label__1	"Incorrect and Misleading: Attention! Sheldon's views of Jefferson's thought to not reflect on Jefferson's! I could not believe what I was reading when I opened up this book. I hought that Sheldon had at least a relatively firm grasp on Jefferson's thought after reading his book ""The Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson,"" I was sorely disappointed. It appears that Sheldon may understand what he thought, but is not able to translate it to the events of today. It is a shame that Sheldon failed in his effort, because such a work as this, properly done, would be wonderful to see. If you truly interested in what Jefferson would think about current events today, let me sum it up for you. He would be outraged and saddened to see what happened to the once great nation that he helped to found. He would be enraged at the tyrannical activities of our government. As for his political leanings, he would most certainly be a radical libertarian."
__label__1	POOR QUALITY: THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS.I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH POORLY MADE CLIPPERS.DO NOT BUY.THE PART HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER FELL OUT WHILE USEING IT.
__label__1	Disappointed !: As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged.
__label__2	"Second 510 purchased in two years; both are excellent: I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
__label__1	Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment: I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
__label__1	"ripped-off by seller: American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
__label__1	DocuMate 510 is Horrible: This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning.
__label__1	ALL images are titled left: I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price.
__label__1	JUNK - don't waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!
__label__1	worked well, but now driver issues: This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here.
__label__1	Not great, but not bad: Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level.
__label__1	"Good scanner - poor software: Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
__label__1	Stinks jams all the time: Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner. Returning it as we speak.
__label__1	Compatible ONLY with their software: Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!
__label__1	worst scanner ever: I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible. I returned it after a few weeks and got the fujitsu scansnap scanner. The fujitsu scansnap is simply the best non-commercial adf scanner on the planet, and I recommend you take a look at it (search for scansnap at amazon).
__label__2	Love Die Happy!: Just to beware, this single does not have a B side to it. Just a remix of the Big Boy song, but still, I love Die Happy, so.
__label__2	intersting: This book has opend up my eyes. Robert Frost is in my mind one of the best potes in the world.
__label__2	Educational toy: This is a very effective toy. After rolling a few 7's or 11's it becomes obvious that even a cursory examination will expose cheating methodology.
__label__2	Get This Player!: Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!
__label__1	Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No.
__label__1	"Good for a little while, but....: Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out."
__label__2	**Great player, but but for newbies**: I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!
__label__2	Zen: I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money.
__label__2	Good Unit: I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
__label__1	First and Last: This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk
__label__1	lacking file format support is not for me: this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me
__label__1	What's with the low sound?: I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it.
__label__1	BASIC DESIGN FLAW: Forget how this unit works because it has a basic design flaw that will drive users crazy! The front cover has a release button that allows removal of the front cover to access the removable battery. Forget about the release button. You don't need it. just tap the lower left hand corner of the case and the cover pops open! Convenient, huh? No way! This design flaw is a total pain in the ass! And it's not just my unit. I tested two other new, out of the box units and both did the same thing. Simply bad design and no quality testing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this unit at all costs unless you don't mind continually closing the case after it has popped open on it's own.
__label__1	Headphone Jack Problems: The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven't they recalled all Zen's?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB, but it's screen stopped working. Creative refused to repair unless I paid $105, so (silly me) I bought a new unit instead.Never again, Creative!
__label__1	"A Possible Discontinued Item?: What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
__label__2	Great MP3 player: Where to start I have had this for 10 years and it is still ticking that alone is a tesament to how well the thing works. Over that ten years It has traveled with me to over a third of the world. This is to include half a tour in Iraq. It has been dropped and has been trough airport security more times than most people. Because of this I have never had a reason to buy an Ipod. And to be honest for music I would rather use this. Only reason that I own anything like an Ipod is that its my Iphone. So I think that the Xtra is by far the one of the best mp3 player made.
__label__1	Headphone jack: I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?
__label__1	Steer clear of all Creative MP3 players: I love my Zen Xtra 40GB - well at least I loved my Xtra. The player is great, except for one major detail - the shoddy quality of the headphone jack. IT WILL FAIL! If you get lucky it will still be under warranty. If you aren't expect to pay at least $40 for the clowns at Creative to fix it. If you think I am just flaming them, check out their forums.
__label__2	"Solid Player without the ""iPod Mystique"": I purchased this player over 4 months ago. I read all of the reviews and I was aware of the pros and cons going in. This player is slightly thicker than the same capacity ipod. On the upside, the battery is user upgradeable, which iPod users can't do. The main downside to this player is the software. I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software. The upsides are great sound quality, great capacity, decent battery life and a good price. If you don't care about looking trendy carrying an iPod, take a good hard look at the Creative Nomad Zen players."
__label__2	Doing the job for less money!!!!: If you want space to carry your music everywhere...this is your device. For all those reviews about the cover, now the cover included with the player has window to the screen, no need to take the player out of the case, unless you are changing the battery. A USB cable is included...no extra purchase. And the fact that you can copy the music back to your computer is a plus for me. The buttons takes a little getting use to it, but for almost $200 less, I can deal with it. The software is easy to learn, and the fact that you can replace the battery with ease...big plus...
__label__1	Not a fan: I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all.
__label__1	THIS PLAYER IS TRASH !: The price looks good do not be fooled.Mine also worked ok for the first 6 months reguardless that the software would not transfer a portion of my music. The death of this unit was when I had fixed the ID3 tages to get all my music to be able to be tranfered to the player , I removed the music library and then reloaded the repaired lib at this point the player will not play anything corectly. parts of tracks play and parts are garbled.This is true when playing over headphone jack usb to pc will still play normal. This is not the same problem as the phone jack breaking like happens to 2/3 of the players.
__label__1	Phone Jack Faulty: I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase... The phone jack is not working properly. Now I am very disappointed. Glad I got a 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy. Recommend you protect yourself if you buy this product. I don't think the phone jack problem is a rare one from what I have read here.
__label__2	Good for the price: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day.
__label__2	"What a great toy!: I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
__label__1	breaks easily and has bad warrenty: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out
__label__1	What a junk: What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
__label__1	Why can't it be rated ZERO stars?: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb.
__label__2	Nice portable, small GPS receiver!: I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. the reason that I bought it was its portability and I could use it both in the car or have it with me when I am walking. So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country. I found another navigation SW for it that I think is nicer and performs better than the one that came with it from HP. (...) mine is an MMCX.
__label__1	Junk!! Yosemite is not POI according Navteq: Can you imagine.?? when I tried to find points of Interest near Yosemite. It said No POI found ..Garmin has Mapsource that is far better than Navteq.It has the options to create automatic, point-to-point routes on your PC without need of a GPS so that you can create multiple waypoints, routes before your transfer it to your device.
__label__1	Angel Baby: I ordered this video and it took nearly a month to arrive because it was being shipped from England. Once I received it, it wouldn't play - at all. I have had two friends try it on their DVD just to make sure mine wasn't the problem and it didn't work on theirs either. Because it was shipped from Europe, do you think it could only be compatible with European DVD's? I got it for my elderly uncle who plays a cameo role in the film and we were so disappointed that it didn't work.Is there a way to get my money back, or get an exchange?
__label__2	Perfect for Every Fisherman: Beautiful and very helpful book for both the experienced and novice fishermen. Great pictures really make the book user friendly. Would make a great gift.
__label__1	"disappointed: I can't share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers.In my opinion, this is a book for advanced fishermen, who already know about fisheries ethics, or don't care about it. The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved."
__label__1	This is rubbish: If you're a Heaven 17 fan, you're gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you're gonna be disappointed. It's just plain rubbish. There are one or two tracks that *might* warrant a second listening, but overall, the CD is annoying and a waste of money. Most of tracks have very little unity between H17 and the dance track, sounding like two songs mistakenly played together.
__label__2	"Detox pretty damn good...: I'd agreed with my fellow reviewer on ""Retox"" (CD #1), but ""Detox"" makes up for it -- it's a totally different sound."
__label__1	"Many Flaws in Mellor's 'Nursery Knits': This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"
__label__2	fun, funky patterns: I bought this book after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that book. From this one I have made the teddy, the cloud pillow and am about 70% of the way through the kaleidoscope blanket (I decided that knitting 49 squares was too much like hard work and so adapted the pattern to be knit all in one go on a circular needle- its going well but maybe the squares would have been easier!). My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows. I plan to knit the star and moon blanket and the kitty cat jumper next. This is a lovely book with plenty of fabulous patterns.
__label__2	Bought 4 of these.: When somthing is worthy of remembering bought and shared with my kids. These kind of books will always be a gift for all their lives.
__label__2	"THE classic jazz Christmas 'album': This is the classic jazz Christmas Album--from before there were dozens of copy-cat collections. I nearly wore out the vinyl, and its yet to be CD'd companion, ""More Sounds of Christmas"". 'Merry Chirstmas Baby' is sooo cool jazz. If you love jazz and dig the Christmas sounds, then this is a MUST."
__label__2	Tired of the same ole at Christmas? This classic will inspire you!: Of course, I grew up listening to this Ramsey Lewis collection through my open bedroom door as my parents decorated the house to make way for the magic of Christmas that was to come~so these Sounds of Christmas are intimately woven into those fondest memories of childhood. But don't take my word for it! Have a listen, and experience how in each piece Lewis wasn't just recreating old stand-bys, he was striving to make them an expression of his own experience of Christmas, and that's the thrill. I can listen to this over and over, long after the season has past, and still get excited.
__label__2	Nice Jazz Xmas.: We purchase this today and have been playing it all afternoon along with Jazz Piano Chrristmas by Boegie Adair and Diana Krall's Christmas album.We made a playlist - Jazz Christmas - which is a great alternative to traditional or Celtic Xmas music.Nice.
__label__2	Ramsey's Best: I remember this recording from my teen years. It was so good that I played it when Christmas was over. Great CD.
__label__1	Ericsson Vehicle Hands-Free Solution HF 7600: I have bought 2 of these items for my 2 cars, but it burns the batteries every time! It even burns the phone, sometimes.Ranieri
__label__1	"Have not read, but know for fact....: This book is falsified and exaggerated. The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published. The Voodoo's also were trying to scare ""outsiders"" who criticized them away with wild, false stories. Don't believe everything you read in this book. It's a hoax."
__label__1	"Tallant's ""creative"" talent: Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either ""Voodoo"" or New Orleans, you probably should read. However, you can ignore the old adage of taking what Robert Tallant had to say with a grain of salt; you will need an entire salt lick to handle this slim volume. It is colorful, exciting, and alas, mostly the product of Robert Tallant's fevered imagination. What facts he didn't get wrong, he completely fabricated.Plenty of scholars have already weighed in on the problems presented and alas, also created by this small piece of creative fiction. It's very entertaining, although occasionally offensive. Mostly, it should not be taken seriously.Eoghan Ballard (Ph.D. Folklore. University of Pennsylvania 2005)"
__label__1	Lousy Book!: I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years old! Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read. Maybe will write it myself!
__label__1	Old and Silly: This is strictly a tourist rag. Don't waste your time. If your looking for a basic introduction to Voodoo, try Laennec Hurbon's Voodoo: Search for the Spirit; Voodoo & Hoodoo by Jim Haskins; Sallie Anne Glassman's Vodou Visions; Leah Gordon's Book of Vodou or even the Complete Idiots Guide to Voodoo.
__label__1	If you want to know about New Orleans Voodoo, avoid this rag: If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward.
__label__2	"Very technical and complex: This book is very detailed, technical and complex. If you're seriously considering exploring the photogravure technique on copper, this book is a must. It tells you everything you will ever need and all the complicated steps in the process. However, there are few historical or contemporary photogravure reproductions which is why this book gets only a four star rating from this reviewer. If you are seriously considering the photogravure process as one you would like to explore, I recommend starting with solar plates rather than copper. It is much less complicated and toxic. A very good resource is ""Printmaking in the Sun"" (2001) by Dan Welden, inventor of this method."
__label__2	M. Mead: Everyons should read M. Mead's research. Her research explains many issues that remain current topics of contention.
__label__2	"Fascinating look into economics, still seen as legendary: This fascinating look into the world of developing and growing economies emphasises the LCD's inverted ""u"" shaped curve of Economic growth. Although written in 1954 this work is seen as the seminal study in the field of developmental economics and was the key factor in securing W. Arthur Lewis's Knighthood in 1963, and Nobel Prize for Economics in 1979."
__label__2	pretty good: The set-up was a little weird and random but the writing was excellent. It was fun to read.
__label__1	What happens when squares come to the Quarter?: Wow! It's like they transplanted someone from Kansas to the epitone of hip cities. There is no sweat, no sips on a hurricane. There is no funk! This is not a city that can be described from the passerby. You might know the names, know the places, but you ain't experienced a thang. You gotta step on a Coke cap and do a little soft shoe. You gotta bar hop, swipe your brow with a hanky in a smoky club where the jazz is the only thing hotter than the weather. You gotta suck a neck of a crawldaddy, eat rice and beans on laundry day. This is a city of great storytellers, and this ain't one of them!
__label__2	A very important book: This is a powerful book. It is written in a clear and engaging style. It is important that people know about the human rights abuses going on in Sudan. Mr. Bok's story does this in a meaningful and moving way.
__label__2	must read for anyone interested in sudan: I found this book enlightening not knowing anything about the current sitaution in sudan other than bits and pieces in the news. I finished this book in almost one sitting i couldn't out it down. I knew of slavery in sudan ,but had no human face or story to put with it.
__label__2	Great Read!!!!: Shows how the story of one man can make a difference. Such a good read about the life of a slave. Something alien to a lot of people. The book draws you in from the start you wont want to put it down.
__label__2	Slavery Still Exists: Excellent book. I've read all but a few pages. I was very touched by Mr Bok's description of his childhood as a slave. A few years ago I'd heard that the Sudan had some problems; after reading this book I have a little idea of those problems in general and of slavery in particular. I strongly recommend this book.
__label__2	"Great stuff behind a ridiculous title.: If you make it past the ridiculous first minute or so of opening title screen and ""spooky"" after effects fan footage, this documentary is chock full of great stuff. As a Brian Wilson fan, I highly recommend it. Although it appears they were trying to tie something together with Dennis Wilson and Manson, it doesn't work and doesn't go anywhere. This should be re cut into two shorts. The Wilson/Beach Boys aspects and interviews with Brian are great, however. And I do recommend it for that reason only."
__label__2	pretty good documentary: overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too.
__label__2	beach boys and the satan: a totally off and enjoyable movie. All Brian Wilson fans should see this movie.
__label__2	Great Group: This is one dvd that any beach boys fan should have in their dvd collection.And if you ever wonder how such an clean cut band got ever involed in the likes of Charles Manson again this the dvd for you or if you like the beach boys music again get this dvd cause it everything that you want to know.So buy your copy now and enjoy.Rondall Banks
__label__1	What a piece of junk!: Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!
__label__1	DON'T BUY THIS ONE!: I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone.
__label__2	Okay: This is an okay player. I never had skipping problems. The music played pretty good. I rate it okay.
__label__1	Not so great: This is NOT Koss at its best. I recently bought its newest model and trashed this one. Don't bother buying it, a good price-bad deal! Buy the new one!Recommended Manufactors: Koss Aiwa Sony
__label__1	DON'T BUY THIS: OK, people, all I have to say is this thing sux. The price may be low, but the thing is just plain crappy. And I though CD players were supposed to play music...
__label__1	somewhat crappy: of course you can't expect the ps2 experience to translate to the psp. gameplay is entirely different, even with gamebreakers and such. would make a great way to pass time on long flights or rides if there were mini-games.
__label__2	this game has it all: though the series nba street never seems to change, the game it self is real fun. it comes packed with features such as just a regular game of street ball. There is also a story mode which you also unlock stages for the regular game of street ball. you can create your own character and choose his stats too. something strange, not in a bad way, but you can do tricks like handstands and more. there are many teams and players to choose from such as kobe bryant. this includes mini-games such as arcade shootout and shot blocker. It also has a really cool music track variety and a sports announcer too. It really is a good game and it will keep you entertained for hours. Its an A++++++++++++ i RECOMMEND THIS!
__label__1	"Great Graphics But NO GAMEPLAY and BAD CONTROLING: When I read these review I thought this game was going to be amazing but no one mentioned that this game has very bad Controling. Here is some on the problems. When you go up for a shot and press the ""o"" button the player goes up and once you let go it takes about half a second for the player to let go of the ball so you really have no SHOT CONTROL. This game is not like many other basketball games where once your let go of the button it shoots. This game has been with me for about 2 weeks and I stopped playing this game on the first day because it got very lame and boaring because you dont have alot of control over your players.There are a few other problems in this game. The players really dont look like the actuall players and do not play like them eather. I would highely reccomend you not to get this game and would suggest ""NBA"" or another great sports game like ""FIFA""."
__label__1	Not worth your money: They should have called this product lemon vaseline. The scent is nice, but it almost isn't a scrub at all; it's got some granulated sugar among a sea of greasy pommade. It leaves skin sticky and does not wash off. Do not buy this product if you're expecting an actual exfoliator!
__label__1	Greasy Grapefruit!: A sugar and oil mix with an explosive citrus fragrance. Yes, your skin will feel softer, but it's not worth it. I had to wash it off with soap and water, then clean the tub before I got out so I wouldn't fall. Take a shower and spray yourself with oil spray - it's not messy or stinky, and certainly not as slippery!
__label__1	Not very good quality, hard-to-see markings: This fan heater can oscillate, which is controlled by the foot switch (i.e., the foot switch doesn't turn the heater on or off). You can tilt the heater, too, but not by much. Overall, the heater feels cheaply made and soemtimes it doesn't work; I have to unplug and replug it to make it go again.The markings for the two knobs (left for power/fan level, right for thermostat) are *very* hard to see; they are almost non-existent. This is a very stupid design decision.I wouldn't buy this heater again despite its low price and good safety features.
__label__2	Value is the issue here: Yes, this isn't the best space heater I have ever owned, but it has a unique shape where it doesn't gather a bunch of dust, like past heaters have, and you can't beat the price for its performance.
__label__1	THIS THING SUCKS: Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.. furthermore.. i will never purchace a heater made of plastic.. think about it.. plastic melts and metal doesnt (at the advertised tempurature) the fan speed i would equate to a gentle breeze if that. the heat output is far, far, below what i would have expected based on the advertisement.. basically in my oppinion this product is worthless to purchase unless you are trying to heat a refrogerator box sized space 5 degrese in a 70 degree enviroment.. look elsewhere for your heating needs.
__label__2	"Telemann: Sinfonia spirituosa; String Concertos: Telemann: Sinfonia spirituosa; String Concertos is a recording under the direction Reinhard Geoebel leading the Musica Antiqua Köln on this Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording from 2002. It contains a well-written essay entitled ""Georg Phillip Tellemann: A Musician Abreast Of The Times"" written by Richard Goebel and translated into English by Richard Evidon. The performance by Musica Antiqua Köln is nothing short of splendid and I thorougly enjoy this recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."
__label__2	better than expected: I read some of the unfavorable reviews, saw the low price and figured it was a dog. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although the cover is totaly misleading. Keeps you guessing to the end.
__label__2	A Hospital Stay can be Stressful...: A hospital stay can be stressful, specifically for toddlers. My grand-daughter was having major surgery and this book aided in comforting her. It eliminated the unknown factors of a 1st time hospital stay.
__label__1	A very simple view of a complex subject: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.
__label__1	"The Facts/The Fiction: I'm sorry, but I have seen such overwhelming evidence to support the fact that almost all ""ritual abuse"" cases WERE indeed caused by mass hysteria and community pressure. So many individuals in these communities were forced not to appear ""weak,"" and jumped on the neighborhood bandwagon to accuse, accuse, accuse.Nothing is more horrifying than the thought of our children being in peril...but that fear sadly caused a lot of irreversible damage to many innocent people's lives in these cases.From the Salem Witch trials to the Senator McCarthy insanity to this mess, it seems that every so often the civilized world goes mad. We can learn from it...but not by reading this wrongheaded book."
__label__1	"I'm sorry, but...: ...I've seen too much damage come out of the trumped-up ritual abuse hysteria of the '80s/'90s. Thank God (yes, I'm a Christian), that this mostly-imagined phenomenon is no longer ""happening."" This book, while well-intentioned, is not based in reality."
__label__1	"A work of fiction: It is extremely important to realize that essentially all evidence of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) comes from memories created during Recovered Memory Therapy (RMT). RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K. Letcham & E. Loftus, ""The Myth of Repressed Memory.""R. Ofshe & E. Watters, ""Making Monsters.""M. Pendergrast, ""Victims of Memory."""
__label__2	"Welcome to da marketplace!: This 1985 album by Bunny Wailer is by no means, his best work. That honor goes to ""Blackheart Man"". But ""Marketplace"" does contain some fine pop-reggae tunes such as Stay With The Reggae, Electric City, and Jump Jump. Plus the album cover is great! I recommened picking this up if you can find a copy."
__label__2	Lost innocense, found hope and heartbreak: This is a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work.
__label__2	La mejor película de Moore: A mi juicio, esta es la mejor comedia de Dudley Moore.El reparto es excelente.Realmente la recomiendo.
__label__1	Software doesn't work!: I am very computer literate. The software provided is not for use with the product. I tried to download drivers so my computer could recognize the camera but had no luck. There are other identical mini cameras like this one packaged under different names. Don't buy this one.
__label__1	Ida B. Wells: Woman of Courage: I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money.
__label__2	THE BEST SALSA: THE BEST SAUCE YOU COULD EVER PUT ON YOUR TABLE AND USE ON YOUR COOKING ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, BRINGS THE COSTARICAN SPIRIT ON YOUR MEALS!
__label__1	OUTDATED: 1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!
__label__2	"Good examples and helpful hints: I bought this book after i failed to get the score i needed in the TOEFL exam, and it helped me a lot at the second time I did the test. The best part about it is the CD-ROM that has 4 complete tests so you can practice just like if you were doing the real Computer Based TOEFL Test. It helps you to get in the mood of the test so you are prepared when you take the real test. There is only one thing that should be enhanced in this book. The review and hints at the ""writing test part"" are not enough. There should be more essay examples. Over all, this is the book you have to buy if you are planning to pay just for one book to prepare for the TOEFL"
__label__1	CDs DO NOT HAVE SOFTWARE!!!!!: It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form
__label__2	This is a perfect review book, but it is not a textbook.: If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit.
__label__1	Wrong CD-ROM: When you buy this book (10th edition), do not buy the one with the CD-ROM. It is not the right one (it is the 9th). All the books with CD-ROM have the wrong one. The correct one comes out in October. So if you want to buy this book do NOT take the one with the CR-ROM, because you're going to waste money!!
__label__2	Second-best resource: This book is the second-best book on TOEFL after Educational Testing Services' (ETS) TOEFL book.
__label__1	CD Was missing: I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing
__label__2	In general, a good book: I took the Toefl test this morning and I have to say that this book was very useful. I haven't received the official grades yet but my note should be between 215 and 265, and given the fact that I've just studied two hours a day for one month...Definitely this book helped me a lot to improve my grammar, but I also believe that the examples were organized in a boring fashion. The practice tests for the listening section are really good, about the reading section... my advice to you: READ! READ! READ! No matter how much time you spend on vocabulary, they will find a word you don't know.
__label__1	Humor about males being incompetent in the birth process: In general, I have little appreciation for humor based on male parental incompetence. Furthermore, ... I have just as little time for humor based on female mechanical incompetence. The theme of this book is male incompetence when it comes to pregnancy and birth. Many of the cartoons are about men being nincompoops in the delivery room, doing such helpful things as fainting, getting sick when looking at the placenta and so forth. ...Some of the cartoons about the baby in the womb are a bit humorous, but overall I did not find this collection of jokes very funny.
__label__1	"Terrible: I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
__label__2	My favorite book - ever!: Vindication is really a treasure - a big red ruby of a novel that penetrates such important history witha raw heart and fierce intelligence. Wow.
__label__1	Horrible: I'd have given this book Zero stars, if that had been an option. Sherwood's writing style is crude at best, with some of her sentences making little to no sense at all. There writing flows very poorly (if at all), and the metaphors are some of the worst I've seen. The dialogue is boring and simplistic. I also agree with the reviewers that said this book is unnecessarily vulgar in many places. One of the worst books I've read in a long while.
__label__2	I loved this book: I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner.
__label__2	Amazing Results: This was recommended to a friend of mine by his doctor. I'm usually very skeptical of herbal treatments, but since the recommendation came from a regular medical doctor, I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by the results. I have been on this product for about 18 months, and my cholesterol has dropped from 252 to 192. I made no other significant changes in my diet. What's more, I am only taking two capsules a day instead of the recommended dosage of four per day. I've read that the big pharmaceuticals are campaigning to require this product to be sold only by prescription. I pray this never happens.
__label__2	Better than pharmaceutical statins: I cannot tolerate pharmaceutical statins and this product gives me excellent results without side effects, been using it for many years.
__label__1	"What a laugh: This junk really stinks (literally, it smells horrible)!! I've used better products and those other attractants did trigger responses in females. I've been INSULTED by the females at my job after using alter ego and been told things like ""what in the world is that new cologne you're wearing, it doesn't smell good"". I told my wife I was wearing a new type of ""after shave"" and she hates it so much I had to promise NOT to wear it to bed. Don't believe the hype of Alter Ego, there are far far far better Pheromones. It's apparent they tried to give it a MASCULINE tone, but they went too far."
__label__1	Got the wrong product and no answer on my mail: I ordered Alter Ego for men but got Alter Ego for woman. I followed the procedure given on the the web to complain and ask how to do the return, but did not get any answer.
__label__2	Simply The Best!: This book dates back to the civil war era. It was the fashion source that women turned to for the most current information on what to wear. If you have ever wondered what they really wore, and why they wore it then I would suggest that you look to these books for the answers. Typically these books have a full year bound together. Each month should have a color fashion plate featuring the current wardrobe fashions. They also have music, poems, short stories, knitting and crochet patterns, health tips and cooking hints. They provide a valuable insight into the era. If you are a civil war reenactor there is no better source for accurate information, and if you are just a fan of American history, these books are an outstanding source.
__label__1	Case doesn't fit phone properly: The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back. I don't know if they are all that way (maybe I got a bad one?), but I didn't want to buy another one to find out.
__label__1	Can you hear me now...Can you hear me now?: The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good.
__label__2	Good Fit & Function: The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall.
__label__2	"Helpful Advice for LDS Authors!: I highly recommend this book and would have given it five stars except for the fact that there was a small typo or two in it--not the fault of the authors, who are all excellent writers.Although the book states it's for LDS writers who want to break into the LDS market, the advice given applies to national market publishing in many cases.I purchased this book at the beginning of my writing career, when I knew nothing about how to get my work published, and learned extensively from it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in having his or her work published. The information runs the gamut from how to write query letters to handling rejections. Thanks in part to ""Publising Secrets,"" my co-author, Nichole Giles, and I now have a book of LDS humor that will be released in the fall of 2009. [....]"
__label__2	Miracle: Okay, this was the last album I purchased after listening to all 4 albums of Evergrey. I have to say this record has something to it, it has a completely different atmosphere. So many songs on this record are so powerful in meaning and in music, listening to them atleast 20 times is not enough at all. Having the preachers voices in the background in a couple of songs defenitely touches souls in some way or other.5 Thumps Up!!!
__label__2	Great book, but get the paper version if you can wait: This book looks like such a great resource into veganized 'authentic' italian. Very excited to try some recipes. However, the kindle version is strange and often slightly out of order.
__label__2	the best cookery book I own!: This is the book to buy for all your vegan and vegetarian friends and family members. It is easy to read and to use... has great recipes and handy hints in a novel layout - and the best part of all is that everything tastes delicious! Some vegan recipes might be healthy but they are not always as tasty as the 'original' Not so with this book! Bryanna's book is filled with recipes ranging from basic cooking instructions to exotic desserts... all yummy and all relatively easy to make.As an added bonus, Bryanna gives lists of mail order resources for sometimes hard to find items - this is especially valuable if you are like me and live in a rural area without easy access to health stores.If you buy just one recipe book this Christmas season, this is the one to get! If I could give it six stars I would!
__label__2	My favorite vegan cookbook!: I've been vegan for about 4 years now, and I've been cooking all of my meals for 2 or 3. I've spent over $100 on a shelf full of vegan cookbooks. This one is the best I own. It's the only cookbook I have that has recipes that make food that's outright better than anything I ate before I went vegan! Ever since I started making my own vegan pizzas, I absolutely stopped missing the greasy things that I'd been getting delivered, and the pasta recipes here are the best I've ever had.The only problem with this book is that the recipes can take a while to prepare. If you're not a big fan of cooking, this probably isn't the book for you. But if you're glad to spend an hour in the kitchen making a meal and want to have some great vegan food, this book is a must!
__label__2	"Best of the series: A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."
__label__1	Horrible.: I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product.
__label__1	Cheap!: I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both.
__label__2	Good instruction: As mentioned in other reviews the actual quality of the video's visuals is not so great but I didn't find that in any way a problem as the content was great. All the basic moves are covered and broken down in a helpful way and each includes several tips for why you may not be getting a specific move and what to try to correct it.I got the video for the trick instruction but also really enjoyed the work out section. Will definitely be trying some of the higher level videos next.
__label__2	A book about finding yourself: Wonderful book that I discovered in junior high. Several years later I bought a copy and this novel has become one of a treasured few I read again every year. The central character (indeed, practically the only character for most of the book) grows so much during her experience that you remember her life changes long after you put down the book. As always, great fast-moving, realistic storytelling from Harry Mazer.
__label__1	An enormous disappointment: As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record.
__label__1	all-round disappointment: I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really.
__label__1	"Is it just me....or....: Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."
__label__1	only 1 in the bag: >:I assumed that the 3 items in the picture was what I was buying, not 1, what am gonna do with one?
__label__2	My wife loves it: My wife thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, saved me from the fact I did not get her tickets to the concert!
__label__1	"Extermely dissapointed: I like Tina very much. I was extrememly dissapointed in this DTS version of the DVD. To my ears, the sound quality was plain at best. When I see DTS, I expect something special. I want to be able to say, WOW! It let me down tremendously. Compared to ""Hell Freezes Over"" it ranks about a 2 and that's being generous. It is WAY over priced!I played it once and never had the urge to play it again!"
__label__1	This Is Not a Live Concert: Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals. What was one of the best concert videos that I had ever seen and heard was ruined by someone who thought he could improve on perfection. Don't waste your money if you've seen the original.
__label__1	What a Cryin' Shame ....: I love Tina. Her music is the epitome of energizing soul-rock. We looked forward to this DTS version of her concert. We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better. I hope we can find another Tina concert worth buying but the Amsterdam concert was a waste of our money. What a cryin' shame.
__label__2	A great performance: This was a a great performance. Tina is superb as are all her back up musicians. The production is great and the DTS sound is outstanding. You won't go wrong with this one.
__label__2	"Simply The Best Concert!: I wish I could give this more then 5 stars. This concert tour was Tina's best concert. I almost did not buy this because I own this on video. When I recevied it, to my surprise, the DVD has four extra songs on it then the video. The songs are ""Wildest Dreams"" ""Let's Stay Together"" ""Something Beautiful Remains"" and ""Better Be Good To Me"" If anyone caught Tina on this tour, here is your chance to own the ""complete"" concert for ever!"
__label__2	The best concert video !!!!!: This is the best concert video ever. Great show and great music ! Tina Turner's show still gets better every time she tours ! Now we have it in perfect DVD picture and DTS sound.
__label__2	Tina Turner concert: LOVE IT , LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I exercise to this DVD, 30-35 minutes at a time. The music is great, Tina of course is great. BEST exercise workout I have ever had and the scenery is FINE, FINE, FINE. Thanks to all who make this DVD possible !!!
__label__2	Flawed but interesting fiction on Russian America: I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless.
__label__2	A Page Turner: Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel.
__label__2	Indelible impact: Sea Runners will etch the coastline of British Columbia in your mind. An awesome tale.
__label__1	big words used for big words sake: I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others.
__label__1	this book is SO BORING: sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars.
__label__2	Rough Hewn Poetry: Descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are accurate and beautiful. The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever. What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort? What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted against great odds? Doig helps to answer these questions. This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest.
__label__2	Wild Alaskan adventure: Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!
__label__1	Pile of Junk - Save your money!: The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work.
__label__2	Advice to potential buyers: Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room.
__label__1	SanDisk Sansa View Player MP3 Player - plays less than two hours: While advertised as eight hours of play time, the player didn't make a two hour trip once in the three or four weeks we had it.Now just waiting to get the refund we've been notified we will receive so we can try something else, hopefully something that will live up to its advertisement this time.
__label__1	cheap: After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking.
__label__1	Overall problematic MP3 player: I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines. The rewind bar doesn't work either! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.
__label__1	not a good experience: I bought a sansa view 8gb from Sold by: txxhenk, and i am not at all satisfied with this product. I just got the player, without a charger, how on the world should i charge this player without a charger. I also didn't receive the USB cable or the head phones or the user manual. I know that this is used-good condition but i didn't expect this.
__label__1	Wow the battery life is bad!: If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!
__label__1	Think twice about buying this player !: I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !
__label__1	Sansa View 8 GB: This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!
__label__1	This Item is a Piece of Junk!: I am thourghly disappointed in this Sansas View. It deleted songs all the time wont keep them on wont connect to computer, if it keeps them it puts them on 3 or 4 times and when you detelted the dups.it deletes them all.
__label__1	sent two back: IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW. THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON. THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE!!
__label__1	"Malfunction and battery doesn't last long: Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
__label__1	Not good: Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music.
__label__1	"SanDisk MP3 Player: Player was defective. After charging battery, I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book, the unit ""locked up"", All functions ceased, and I couldn't turn it off: back of player became very warm. Battery finally lost life and the unit shut down. One unsuccessful attempt was was made to recharge it. It was returned for refund.."
__label__1	"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
__label__1	Hate this thing: I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed.
__label__1	"Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.: Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview. Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the ""Previous"" button pressed in ""hold"" mode while connecting the cable to laptop."
__label__2	"Great MP3 player!: This is a great MP3 player, and costs a lot less than an Apple equivalent. Shipping was fast. In case you want to sync some tracks from your computer to the Sansa View, connect it to your computer and call SanDisk support and they will ""activate"" the player remotely and you will be able to sync ever after. I downloaded to user manual. It is much more detailed than the skippy little guide that comes with the player. All in all I am very happy with this player."
__label__1	Its a Cheap MP3 Player thats it: Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap.
__label__1	Good Product-when it lasted.: This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best.
__label__2	"Sansa GP3 Player is good for the value: My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!"
__label__2	Excelent product!: I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended.
__label__1	Horrible for long audio files: The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for.
__label__1	Sandisk 8 gig black: Bought two units and after a few months one stopped working. Could get no info from the unit it was dead. Contacted Sandisk and ask for quick replacement. Offered to prepay to secure item would be shipped quick. Was told I did not need this. Item was bad and would be replaced with in a few days. After waiting a full month, I had to phone the Co on Ca. Manager told me the order had not been shipped and this some times happens. Had phoned the supply house in another state and player would be shipped.Worse customer support I have seen. Would not buy another unit from this Co. Manager I talked with sounded like a brain dead stoner. Might be why orders get lost.Order with caution and if you require replacement, prepare to follow up daily.
__label__1	"Did not work out of the box: I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!"
__label__1	Bad Luck?: The Sansa View 8GB I received was faulty. The battery would not hold a charge and/or the player would not turn on. This happened within hours of opening the player packaging and attempting an initial full-charge of the player's battery. The battery is only chargeable via USB and I tried using a PC and an AC to USB adapter to charge it. There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players (namely Cowon brand players) so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new (or repaired) player. I was not very impressed with the build quality of the player. It felt and looked very prone to scratching or other damage if not treated with extreme care. Furthermore, I found another player that suited my personal needs and desires better than the Sansa View.
__label__2	Good Player - Bad Tech Support: I had no end of trouble getting it installed on my Vista computer. Tech Support was useless, apparently not admitting to the problem. I finally tried the forums and found a workaround. Finally working, the player is great for music and my Audiobooks, small, easy to use, generally just what I wanted.
__label__1	Not Happy: I recently purchased a used 8 GB View. It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card. The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card.
__label__1	ejects micro SD chip!: I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!
__label__2	One major criticism: Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!
__label__2	Decent: Well, on the plus side it has great sound and good picture the ability to expand the memory and an FM radio(iPods don't have this feature). The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly. Overall this is a good product.
__label__2	He likes it!: I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight.
__label__2	"Better than expected: THE SANSA VIEW IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT LACKS BASS POWER. THE VIDEO PLAYER WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU FIND AN EASIER WAY THAN PROVIDED BY SANDISK. USING THEIR PROVIDED ""SANSA MEDIA CONVERTER"" WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THEIR WEBSITE TAKES HOURS TO CONVERT A MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW, BUT USING THE ""PSP MOVIE CONVERTER"" DOES THE JOB IN COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW USING RHAPSODY MEDIA PLAYER. ONCE I LEARNED TO DO THAT I BEGAN ENJOYING THE PLAYER. THE PICTURE VIEWER IS GREAT AS WELL. I ALSO OFFER THE FM RADIO FOR WHEN U WANNA HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DSEPERATE FOLDER FOR AUDIOBOOKS AND PODCAST, EXPANSION SLOT. A BANG FOR THE BUCK."
__label__2	Love My MP3: I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price.
__label__2	SANSA Sandisk 8 gb: I've had this product about 3 years now and use it everyday. I'm amazed at the quantity of music that I can put on it. I haven't used the video part of it, but, in a pinch have used it while DJing when my other equipment failed. I totally recommend this.
__label__1	Nice player except.....: Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen.
__label__1	if only it could last: This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics.
__label__1	This device is the worst ever: if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last
__label__1	a Mac user: NOT at all friendly for a Mac user. The instructions are not at all helpful and tech services are not available on weekends.
__label__1	Save up and get a nano instead.: Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!
__label__1	De la poudre aux yeux: J'ai acheté un Sansa View 16gB pour $200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie à peine, et la batterie vient de mourrir. L'estimation pour la réparation et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgré son excellente sonorité, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile à comprendre, parfois il gèle... à éviter!
__label__1	Frustrating: Any problem listed in previous reviews, I encountered with mine. At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer.
__label__1	Bad battery - not replaceable - throw away unit: I recently received a refurbished View as a birthday gift, charged it up, set it down a couple of days. When I picked it up I found it was dead. I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries.
__label__1	Great player, bad job with the refurbish: We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players.
__label__2	go with the view: I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit. This unit does a better job playing everything (audio and videos) and with a larger screen and longer battery life, I was sold. I think this unit is a great option if you want to avoid ipod and itunes.
__label__1	OK but lots of bugs which never get fixed!: I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers.
__label__2	Great little mp3: I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there.
__label__1	Battery problems: Worked fine... until the battery died after one year. You can't replace it so essentially the player is useless. Would not recommend.
__label__1	Poor Qiality Control: Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers.
__label__1	Less then one year, Issues already: I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player.
__label__1	"I think I hate it: I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with ""Y"" and don't what to start from ""A"" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to ""Y"" but want to scroll up from ""Z"" to ""Y"", you can't."
__label__2	Good value for the money: I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it. She experienced some difficulty at first downloading her music, but this problem has been resolved.The player is very easy to use - she did not even need to read the manual.
__label__1	You get what you pay for: I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!
__label__1	disappointed with this MP3: I purchased this MP3 player as a Christmas gift for our daughter only to find out on Christmas Day that is not compatible without our computer despite every update available. While we could see the preloaded video and it is very clear and bright, we were never able to upload any music. My husband (who is computer wizard) spent 12 hours trying to get this thing to work, but without any success. Next time we'll buy an IPod.
__label__2	Good Value for the Money: Pretty good value for the money. Prefer Zune's tactile interface. Not much information on how to install Videos, photos or Album Art. But should be able to figure it out from the internet. Try to keep it away from Cell phone, when I put my View in the same pocket as my cell phone it caused the View to lock up or shut down. Like the fact you can add memory with SD cards. Overall more positives than negatives.
__label__1	Has one important major flaw: Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time.
__label__1	Be nice if it worked.: Apart from arriving in nearly 2 pieces ( apart ) it did not work and the software did not work either. Going away in a week, so I cannot use it. Pissed off.
__label__2	A few kinks, but overall it works well: Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out.
__label__2	as good as an i-pod: well i had an rca 4108 was ok, but the headphone input circuit broke. so i went on a hunt looking for another. So i started to read reviews. this sansa was the best i've read and so far held up to it's reviews. I like it and would recomend it.
__label__2	Sansa e280: Can not beat this item for the price, hands down!Excellent product with all the features you could want, period.
__label__2	Wonderful device: I purchased this for my husband to load a recertification course on and study. He also has music on it and is enjoying it very much. It was a great price, especially for this much memory. And Amazon's service was great as usual.
__label__2	Sansa View ROCKS!!!!: I have had this Model Sansa View MP3 since it first came out in 2005-2006. It remains durable & in perfect working condition. I store music and pics on it and have never had any issues. I was my first and only MP3 player until I bought an iPhone this year (2011). However, I still use the Sansa View for the gym because it's light weight ( I also have the arm case that goes with it for working out). I highly recommend it if your are looking for a quality MP3 player. I purchase and download music from the web-sit it gives you at purchase and i also transfer music from my Windows Media Player on my PC. Too Cool!!!
__label__1	"Wow...: Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it. ""WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS"" This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it. It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing. Basically, you can't skip the song if you wanted. Nice going Sansa, you made a piece of crap."
__label__1	Not What I Had Expected: I had hoped for a more from Sandisk. After about 10 very frustrating days of trying to get it to work properly, the unit stopped altogether. The expansion memory never did work. It would only duplicate what was on the internal memory. Sandisk support was polite and tried to be helpful. Unfortunately, we were not in any way successful in getting the unit to work. After I got the error message on my computer that the unit has malfunctioned and should be replaced, I sent it back.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)
__label__1	Plzz don't buy it: Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :[
__label__2	flowerpots and spanish guitar: This is really a beautiful album. Micus plays all of the tracks by himself, on spanish guitar, zither, nay and flowerpots. The flowerpots are particularly interesting. They sound sort of like a marimba. The compositions are very interesting, and not at all sappy. I am sure micus cringes to see his music thrown in bins with world music and new age. It is not at all trite or commercialized. Some of the pieces include solo guitar, then some vibrant otherworldy rythmic flowerpot playing, back into solo guitar, generally quiet.
__label__2	The best book I've read on public speaking: As a member of Toastmasters I have access to a wide variety of materials and seminars on public speaking. However, this one book covered more material in less space and in easier terms than all the seminars I've attended. His style is not that of a college textbook - if it were I wouldn't have read it. His style is straight from the hip. I consider this book to be my textbook, with Toastmasters providing the chance to practice what I've read. This book has done more to improve my speeches than the formal Toastmaster's evaluations.
__label__2	"Myth: Great speakers are born: Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's ""The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more. This book has stood the test of time and helped thousands of people, I'm glad to say that I'm one of them."
__label__1	public speaking book: I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt. Although it was somewhat interesting it wasn't doing what I needed it to and that was to teach me not to want to disappear before I got up in front of a group of people.
__label__1	good examples - no index: Public speaking in narrative form. Lots of stories and examples from Lincoln to businessmen in 1969. Interesting to read. No index, not user-friendly as a resource.
__label__1	Carnegie Aint what he used to be...: Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead.
__label__2	Book by Dale Carnegie: I read book Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking. It gave me practical skills to do my presentation in the right way. I defended my thesis on 29th of December 2010. Some professors said me, that it was interesting speech. The principle of effective learning is read and do as written. Moreover it allow me to raise my language skills in English, because this book is written in understandable way and I am Russian. Many thanks to author and people who produced this book. Danil from Tomsk, Siberia
__label__1	Huh?: I get the idea to be clear and to the point. But this was outdated before it was written, a real basic book,kids should read it once
__label__1	Returned it: This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
__label__2	Quick review on public speaking: If you can get past the setting of the book, it provides lots of helpful hints on presenting various subject. A very good read. I am planning on purchasing other books by this author.
__label__2	A must read for public speaking: Excellent book. This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend.
__label__1	Not what you're thinking: I've read this book as well as Carnegie's 2 other books, How to Win Friends & Influence People as well as How to Stop Worrying & Start Living. This one was a let down after those two, which i highly recommend (even with the old school references).This book stated a lot of common sense but nothing that I found I could use in off-the-cuff talks. In fact it, discourages that. It's also a bit of a dry read.While I admire his other books, I did not like this one.
__label__2	Another Great Book by Dale Carnegie: I loved reading Dale Carnegie's books since I picked up How to Win Friends and Influence People. His writing style is very easy to read and he is always giving examples to make the content as clear as possible. That being said, The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking is a great book. I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first. However, if you are specifically looking for a book on Public Speaking, Dale Carnegie is a great author and he has several books about this topic. This one is great and I recommend it.

__label__2	"Great Player/Radio/USB drive, but...: I ordered this great little player as a birthday gift to myself. It's outstanding except for one problem - The firmware is the unit as shipped was buggy! In version 1.04.3, any interrupted transfer to the device causes it to malfunction!I looked up the Creative support forum and dozens of people reported the same problem, namely a complete lockup of the unit and subsequent inability to ""boot"" it...My first unit failed after about fifteen minutes of playing with it, loading files, etc. Needless to say, I was distressed. Turns out YOU MUST UPDATE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it recharged. Another point I must strongly emphasize is that YOU MUST ""EJECT"" THE DEVICE under Windows BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT.I'm happy to report that firmware version 1.05.1 is much better and that I have not ""crashed"" since updating to it. I'm really enjoying it!I love this product and would give it 5 stars were it not for the buggy firmware that shipped with it. Cheers!"
__label__1	"Great at First, but......: My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift. About a month ago it just stopped working. We have had several emails and phone calls back and forth to the company, ""Creative"" is an accurate name for them...they are creative about honoring the 90 day warranty by putting you off until you are out of warranty. They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced...and nothing yet. I emailed the company again today. They do not have a customer service number that is toll free, and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so, but now, I will never buy another ""Creative"" product again, based on their customer service."
__label__1	"Crashed within 3 hours of first use - needs new firmware !!: This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."
__label__1	Watch Out!!!: I received my new Rhomba, and was all excited to open it and try it out. I open it and go through the quick setup guide and plug it into a USB port on my pc so it can charge up. As I am waiting for the unit to charge I start reading through the manual and come across the following message... The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them....Say What???!!!! I fired off an email to Creative asking them to provide a little more clarity on this statement with no response. Needless to say I am returning the unit.
__label__2	SD: just for the record: last day off my vacation in mexico and i dived into the Carraibean with my digital camera into my pocket :) (don't ask why) and althogh the camera is now mearly scrap (pentax optio s) the memory card works fine and i didn't lost any of my vacation photos with would have been a lot worse - so SD cards are water proof and salt water proof :)
__label__1	Fragile: This is a cute little gadget, but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket. Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player.
__label__1	Cheaply made, NOT reliable: The Rhomba is cheaply made. Mine stopped working completely after about two months. Piece of garbage.
__label__1	Creative could be creative: I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER
__label__1	"Don't buy this Product !!!!: I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet."
__label__1	A product with error.: The first day I bought this, it didn't work. But then the next day, it worked a gain. I continued to use it for 1 month, and it didn't work completely. Many people used it and said that it is a bad product with errors.
__label__1	Creative Rhomba = Big Headache: After carefully opening the player, reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter, the player froze up. I can not accurately describe my anger. I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly. If it didn't cost me $125, I would have run it over with my car. Do yourself a favor, avoid the Rhomba at all costs.
__label__1	"Don't buy this Product !!!!,: read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet. Dealing with their customer support is hell. remember I warned you ""Dont buy this product"""
__label__1	One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read, Don't Waste Your Time: I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash.
__label__1	Big Dropoff: There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it.
__label__1	Not a good followup...: The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers.
__label__2	bargain blues, McShann style: What a deal. A nice collection of 40's small band blues and swing by McShann and friends. A great introduction to the world of McShann.
__label__2	EXCELLANT SHADE: Highly recommended, I find this canopy durable, an ease to install, and made of high quality construction. For the past 3 years, I have rented similar type canopies for my summer B.B.Q.'s. These rentals exceeded over $300.00 per occasion. Now, I can enjoy this canopy and at the same time save hundreds of dollars on the rental fee's.
__label__2	Great results. I'm going to start up again: Over the winter, i seem to gain alot of weight. As a high school quarterback, that is not acceptable. Last summer, i think i went from 160 to 150. That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing.
__label__1	Disappointed that I wasted my money: After reading all the great reviews on this product on Amazon, I decided to go for this. I don't typically have good results from diet products, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I've been taking these for 3 weeks, as directed, and I might as well have been taking sugar pills for all the more this is doing for me. I felt like my appetite increased, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I've been fluctuating up and down 3 pounds for the past couple of weeks. I gave this two stars because I didn't feel the anxiety or sleeplessness that some people complained about, but I'm still disappointed. I was hoping I'd find something that actually worked!
__label__1	Green Tea: Well, it arrived on time and in OK condition, but after almost a month of taking it, I haven't noticed any change, except now I have stomach cramps.
__label__2	This is Great! Get Real...: Okay, let's face it, it's all about time and there's just too little of it. With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks. I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch? Statistics prove that fewer people cook from scratch and get bland, pedestrian fast food, with Semi Homemade Cooking anyone can be a ten minute maestro of the kitchen.
__label__1	Not at all good: This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley....
__label__1	"Rip OFF!: Sandra Lee is a rip-off! I really like to cook - I read lots of cooking magazines and watch lots of cooking shows and Sandra Lee is so lame. Her recipes are not recipes at all, she just tells you to buy things and heat them up! One of her ""creations"", the kids cupcakes, were on the cover of an issue of ""Gourmet"" several years ago! I'm all for easy recipes but hers are not worthy of my time! She is a queen of velveeta processed, hydrogenated mediocrity! Don't waste your money. Just go to the velveeta website - the recipes are free there."
__label__2	Love it, Love it, LOVE IT: So many great looking, great tasing recipes. Fantastic for us working women who want to put a good meal on the table but have such little time. I've bought her second book too. And I'm buying a set for my nephew and his finance.
__label__1	Trailer Home Cooking, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Recipes on the Back of Pre-Packaged and Canned Garbage: Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money.
__label__1	Semi- additive Cooking: Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .The concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.Hard to imagine Wolfgang endorsing such a book
__label__1	Barely edible: I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe? I received this book as a gift, from a well-meaning friend. I would have much rather gotten one of rachel Ray's books, as she really knows how to make fast and simple meals from fresh ingredients.
__label__2	Don't be fooled by these books,: just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn't mean you can't take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. I sub as many fresh ingredients as I can for the pre-packaged and I still have a good meal made in no time. That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals. The photos and lay out are outstanding, and the books are well priced for the quality we get from them. Worth the money.
__label__1	"Rip Off of previous Book: I'm so mad! I got this supposedly ""new"" Cookbook and when it came it looked identicall to the first cookbook expcept her picture on the front is different! I bought the same book from Sandra Lee 2 years ago!! Same damn pictures and same damn recipes are in this ""new"" Cookbook! Don't waste your money I'm returning mine today!"
__label__1	Call the doctor!: Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes. This book is a joke. Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this. Heart attack city! Oh, and crappy food. Did I mention how bad her recipes are? Terrible. The scourge must be stopped! Whoot!
__label__2	Producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time: Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time. How? By blending 70% store-bought ingredients with 30% fresh foods to produce the taste of homemade. Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter.
__label__1	Not a practical book: This oversized book does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages. I tried cans and a rolling pin to weigh down the pages and nothing worked. The money spent on the endless photographs (do we really need to see a photo of empty cd boxes?)and the pre paid reply postcard ... would have been better spent on a smaller hard covered book that would be easier for home cooks to use....
__label__1	Do Not Buy This Book: I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee.
__label__2	What took me so long?!: Why did I wait so long to get this book I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography....and easy to make your dish look like the photo!
__label__1	Advertising: It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy.
__label__1	"Outdated already!: I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use. Frustrated, I asked the store mananger who told me that the products I was looking for, Campbell's fat-free mushroom soup and Jello refrigerated vanilla pudding cups are no longer available in my area.Why make such a big fuss about using this or that brand when they aren't even available? I won't waste any more time travelling around town looking for the exact brand names needed to make the recipes in this book.I have better things to do! Maybe this book needs a ""use-by "" date before even more products become obsolete."
__label__1	"WHAT is the point of this show???: Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."
__label__2	Help for the holidays: With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year.
__label__2	A must read: Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy. Almost four decades of the drug war have produced no discernable reduction in drug use, but loads of folks in prison and a steady erosion of our constitutional rights.
__label__2	quarter through, and totally imressed: I have yet to complete this book, but its great so far. Entertaining, and educational. hard to mix the two and keep my interests. I hope this helps sway you to purchase. HAPPY SHOPPING
__label__1	Disappointing: The music plays just fine but the on screen picture is horrible. The picture is blurry and it looks like graphics form the 60's.
__label__2	A quick read....: .......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures.
__label__2	A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN TRUE CRIME!! RIVETING!!: Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his.
__label__2	"Sheer madness, meticulously documented: Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."
__label__2	The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.: I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered.
__label__2	the most exciting book i've ever read. i loved it!!!!!!: I thought this book was magnificent. The way Vincent Bugliosi described everything in such depth. I found some of it to be dragging in the beginning, but am I glad I didn't give up on this one. The chilling reality is what got to me the most.
__label__2	"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book."
__label__2	"Wonderful book: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the ""family"" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."
__label__2	Super Scary and Fascinating: Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing.
__label__2	Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil.: Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman.
__label__1	kindle edition warning ...no pictures: what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this.
__label__2	Helter Skelter: I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be.
__label__2	Amazing.: I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book.
__label__1	The plague that this book has caused.: Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone.
__label__1	"Too bad the book is completely fiction...: The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious ""ideology"".He needed to give ""evil"" a face... and Manson was convenient.""Helter Skelter"" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."
__label__1	"Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie: I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his ""Helter Skelter"" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."
__label__1	"the classic pulp novel is still selling fast: Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."
__label__1	Helter Smelter: Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?
__label__1	Gratuitous slasher porn: In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago.
__label__1	Helter Skelter: The DA's own fabrication: This story is not the true story of the murders, but the concoction of VB. The whole Helter Skelter theory was in his mind and in his mind only-he saw ahead to the book deal and movie. Of all the seat's in the court room, over 98% were taken by media. He played into their hands by making up this totally outrageous story (prompted by a liar Sadie and turn coat,get me outta my legal mess Danny DeCarlo). This is fiction. And by the way, Charlie wasn't even present at any of the murder scenes, nor did he order any murders, so why is he in prison? Because he received an unfair trial at the hands of VB. This book is NOT recommended.
__label__2	"Blood Fest 1969: The chilling story as told by detective Bugliosi will scare and shock you to your utmost. There is an eerie sense all about you that keeps you wondering how such diabolocal people could exist in this world. In all its gorey details and brutally honest depiction of the Manson ""Family"" Bugliosi does not shield the reader from the horrrid acts committed. He is forthright in his personal fellings toward the murders and his perception of the Manson ""Family"" including their theology that ""Helter Skelter"", the final war between the balcks and the whites, is the most outrageous in all of history, which made everything in connection to the murders just as strange."
__label__2	Great Read: This is a great book so far. I am a little farther than halfway into it and it is great. Although the writing is a little choppy at times, it is definitely worth it.
__label__2	"Through the eyes of Bugliosi: This book truly lives up to what Vincent Bugliosi says on the first page of his book ""Helter Skelter-The True Story Of The Manson Murders""-- ""This story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you."" This is not only the best true crime book ever written, but it is the ONLY true crime story ever written. Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book."
__label__2	Amazingly horrific: I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story.
__label__2	"AMAZING!!: Helter Skelter was the absolute best true crime book I have ever read. From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the ""family"". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!"
__label__2	"Helter Skelter: the Kindle edition review: All of the good things said about ""Helter Skelter"" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."
__label__2	Mind Blower!: This book is absolutely riveting! It seems that only a couple of books a year can hold my attention like this one - which is a shame. I always have a sense of loss after reading a great book. The whole Manson paradigm is so bizarre and twisted that it just blows your mind. I read this book over a long rainy weekend and could not put it down. If you like fascinating stories where reality is stranger than fiction, this is THE book you should read. Top notch!
__label__2	True crime written well: This book was a fast and intense page turner. It was scary and interesting since watching and reading the case in the news. The book was well written by the prosecutor. I recommend this as a read because it was one of the crimes of the century.
__label__2	YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK: THIS AN AMAZING BOOK, I WAS VERY SPELLBOUND WHEN I READ THIS. ICANT BELIVE HOW ONE PERSON COULD BE SO SICK IN THE HEAD AND ALL THEKIDS HE HAS HAD IT IS GROSS. I HAVE DONE SO MUCH RESURCH ON MANSON FOR A CLASS PROJECT THAT I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN HE DOES. THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK IT WILL LEAVE YOU AMAZED. END
__label__2	this has got to be the best book ive ever read: i read this book a little over a year ago when i was 14, this book was so good and it was told like a story not just from some 3rd person view, i felt like i was in the books world it was that good, this book kept getting more and more intriging as i turned the pages i think if i remeber correctly i finshed the book in 4 days, cause it was so damn good... i hella recomend this book to everyone, pretty scary too and i liked the pictures
__label__2	reread of Helter Skelter: Many years ago, this was a popular,horrible event. Just wanted to read it again as an older person so see if my images had changed of the book.
__label__2	Helter Skelter The Manson Murders: while this book is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book. On the whole a good read which reflects how things were at the time of the Manson Murders but ultimately a little unsatisfactory, somehow.
__label__2	Some interesting moments.: 'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' is an examination of Charles Manson and his cult and the bizzare trial that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about. There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson. It is surprising that he was able to hold the power over those people like he did.
__label__1	Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete: Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format.
__label__2	great and insghtful: well written and informative. I finished the whole 689 page book in one week and three days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
__label__2	Most interesting: This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
__label__2	Surprisingly Witty!: I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry read. I was very pleasantly surprised at, not only how well-written, but how witty this book truly is! I even laughed out loud at some of Bugliosi's comments, which is astonishing considering the murderous content of the book.It really speaks for itself that after three decades, this book is still a literary staple!
__label__2	"Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness: Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The ""family"" is truely an unbelievable group of people that absolutely butchered for the begining Helter Skelter. I would strongly recomend it to anyone."
__label__2	DAWN'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER: Helter Skelter is a very interesting book. Almost every page keeps you on the seat of your chair. It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!
__label__2	Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious: I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders.
__label__2	"What else can I say? The definitive telling of the Manson murders.: ""Helter Skelter"" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."
__label__2	Real Life Horror Story: This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history.
__label__2	Good for the story itself, not the writing: This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song).
__label__2	"READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!: This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an ""A""). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his ""family"". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."
__label__1	bad book: it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole Manson murders. I have never been more bored with a book in my entire life.
__label__1	"This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!: This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."
__label__2	A masterpiece of cool jazz, funk and classical music: I just love this album. I have owned the original album since 1979 and when my eyes fell on the CD in one of our local shops about seven years ago now, I didn't have to think twice and bought it straight away. I still love to listen to it once every so often. The recording quality is just superb, especially on the acoustic recordings! A jazzfunk masterpiece, with a great rythm section (Andy Newmark and Ralph MacDonald), funky bass (Gary King), Bob James on keyboards and the cool and sophisticated flute of the man himself. Huberts interpretations of Ravel's 'Forlane' and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and Juliet' are just awsome. Played with tremendous virtuosity, perfect timing and outstanding deliverance! If you are in to jazz and funk but you love your classical music too, you are going to be hooked, I know I am!
__label__1	extremely dull: I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading
__label__2	A Good Book: This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author.
__label__2	"Great ballads.: Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like ""I Got it Bad..."" ""Your Love Has Faded"" and ""Day Dream."" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."
__label__1	Liver Cleanse Supplement: Did not use as my G.I. Dr. said that a recent study showed that they do not help.
__label__2	A nowadays science-fiction: In 2081, a new kind of telescope, using subtle quantum effects, allows for a detailed examination of all the planets of the galaxy and abroad. Life is present everywhere, but not civilization. Subtle evidences show that civilizations are numerous, but that they disappeared... Where? What is our own enthralling future?This book is anticipation in the Jules Vernes style: bold but realistic prospects with nowaday 2000' science, some scientific popularization, without forgetting warm-hearted characters in an optimistic vision of life.Richard Trigaux, author.
__label__1	Quit working after 3 hours: The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again. But I won't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again. I got a new laptop.
__label__2	Well Written, with an Interesting Twist: This story was way more than just a romance novel. There was an element of time-travel involved that gave the story a whole new aspect. I enjoyed the book, and just wish it hadn;t ended where it did. If I'm not mistaken, there may be a sequel in the works. I would certainly want to continue the adventure.
__label__2	Excelent: Very interesting read, if you love history you will love this book as I did. I could not put it down.
__label__2	Good Book: A historical romance from the 1700's that tells of the true massacre of the French by the Natchez Indians. A good read.
__label__1	"too long and boring read: This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the ""gentleness and thoughtfulness"" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."
__label__1	Impossible: This set was so complicated that we are returning it. My 8 year old cannot figure it out nor can any of the adults who have tried. The instructions are incomplete. I really wanted to like this but it is so complex and the instructions are so poorly presented that we are sending it back - it just was not any fun and actually became really frustrating and chore-like to try to complete the first design. Finally, we gave up and repacked it all.
__label__1	would be good if only there were directions: This kit has a building diagram for only 1 project and that diagram was so poor that my husband who played with these kkits as a kid in the 60s (yes they have been around that long) couldn't easily figure it out - and he rarely has trouble figuring out anything. Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions. I encourage the manufacturer to do so.
__label__1	Impossible to use: I bought this for my 10 year-old son. He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail.
__label__2	Older kids like it...: ...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!
__label__2	excellent rollator/walker: This is a very good rollator. Very easy to adjust, very stable, rolls easily over grass and other uneven outdoor surfaces.The adjustable height seat is great.
__label__1	Cosco Ability Care Traveler rollator: The rollator might have been en excellent one, and was keenly waited for.However, 2 days past it's expected latest arrival time, it had not arrived. The company that was supposed to send it admitted that they had printed the shipping label, notified Amazon and us that it had been shipped, but had not done so.They offered a pink one which was absolutely not suitable for the male user, so I demanded the money back, which they promptly did. I was underwhelmed by the professionalism of that company, and notified Amazon.com about it.
__label__1	Not Happy: I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality.
__label__2	I love my card holders: It makes so much easier to hold my cards and my friends like them very much. Thanks for selling this product.
__label__2	great for kids and seniors: I bought these for myself because I have arthritis and it makes card playing much easier and more enjoyable. My elderly father also uses them. They're sturdy and stand by themselves.
__label__2	So handy: This makes playing the game so much easier. You can view you cards at all times without straining your hands. Especially good if you have arthritis.
__label__2	Helpers when playing cards: We play a card game that requires holding several cards. These card holders are a huge help. I really like having multiple colors.
__label__1	Not new ,disappointed: I was surprised to see that the item was used. Advertised as new. Would have liked the new ones stead got used.
__label__2	Set of four Free standing card holders: Haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I'm sure they will be just fine and work as expected.
__label__2	Great for arthritic hands: I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it's difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. We used them over the holiday and they were a great hit.
__label__2	Great for arthritic hands!: These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. Very easy to use.
__label__2	expensive but well worth it.: These card holders are durable and large as well as ruggedly built. The design allows the card holder to be held or sat on a table during play.They cost more than smaller designs but for my money they are well worth it.
__label__2	Very Handy: I play Hand and Foot every other week and the four of us love using these. You get 13 cards and it is very handy to have.
__label__1	Don't buy: What ever you do don't buy this product. It not only came in used but beaten to death. It was scratch, dented and chipped. This is my 4th time writing a review on this product all other attempts have be block like I suspect this one will be to.
__label__1	Watch the price: I bought this from the same co. before christmas and was stunned that the price had doubled. On the page the price was not clear!
__label__2	war of the warewolf: Greenberg and Tuccille have written an old fachoned lycanthropic thriller with some amusing political undertones. Takes me back to the pleasures I encountered in watching Bela Lugosi. But Ludwig von Dracula is very different from Bela's Dracula!
__label__2	Works Great: The biggest minus is having to remove the phone from the cradle and unplug the cord from the phone to remove from the car. Other than that minor inconvienence it works great
__label__1	"OOPS! WRONG BOOK!!: This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of ""Dark and Stormy Night."" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized! Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word ""Execrable,"" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."
__label__1	Pass On This One: For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!
__label__1	All foam - no beer: I usually like Flint and have read everything he published. This is the biggest single book and by far the worst. The book is supposed to be a comedic fantasy. Maybe it is. If you are looking for a book where everything is supposed to be funny and nothing is to be taken seriously, maybe this is your book, but I pitched it after 66 pages.
__label__1	put it down after a few chapters: Well I'm not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work.
__label__1	Too wordy....: I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
__label__2	Great product!: Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!
__label__2	Great value - now: These once cost nearly $3000, but I got my z557 for about 1/15th of that. I've had it for over six months and used it for radio, TV, DVD movies, Internet video (full-screen HD) and general computing. With 2GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate, it actually runs really well. My keyboard isn't as bad as what was written about, here, but it is not the kind of keyboard you would use for more than surfing, anyway. And, it will take any USB keyboard or keyboard/mouse, wireless, or otherwise. I'd recommend using a wired LAN instead of its weak wireless. And, it can seem like it's running hot, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem. If you have the room, it's a decent all-around system, looks good and is nicely built.
__label__1	"Utopian fantasy: Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.) His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various ""outsider"" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain ""outsider"" males are physically abused by the ""alpha males"" of the group. Look at the primary source texts and warlike art of civilizations from the Aztec to the Sumerians and you will see intolerance is a problem of the y-chromosome, not social conditioning from one particular society. Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems."
__label__1	Found it Irritating: Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books.
__label__2	"Yesteryear: I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it. The chacarters he builds in this book are great. It's a book to read when you wish to lay back and dream about how good ""US"" humans are .......and how fanatical some of ""US"" can be. If you enjoy Mr. Hogans books you will greatly enjoy this good story. I have read all of Mr. Hogan's books and enjoy them all. I can't wait to see where his next story will take me."
__label__2	"Great Science Fiction: I read books for ""escapism"" and for the pleasure of reading. I'm not a political or social scientist, so evaluating a work of fiction on that basis is meaningless to me.Simply put... It's a very good story that is both easy to read and hard to put down. I loved it."
__label__1	This book could have been good.: The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story.
__label__2	A book to read again and again: A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'.
__label__1	Do not buy. This is a BOOTLEG: Since when did Amazon have the legal right to sell bootleg CD's? I purchased this cd so I can listen to it in the car, ( I have had it on wax for 20 years)The CD is a CDR... When did Amazon buy the licensing rights to Music of Life? They are charging people $15.00 for a bunch of MP3's burnt on to a CD lmao. I give it one star because it is a CDR..
__label__1	Poor Design, Construction & Quality: We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again.
__label__2	One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.
__label__2	Pretty entertaining: Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.
__label__2	Wings Above the Diamantina: If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one. It is well written. Set in the Australian outback, the detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, is half white, half aborigine and makes full use of his native skills. He informs the reader of the progress he is making in solving the mystery as he discovers the clues, while still maintaining the suspense. This is an interesting and complex mystery.
__label__2	"A must have for your CD collection!: This is a great CD! Ten originals along with excellent remakes of ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and ""I Can't Hold Hold Out"", both of which the band has molded into their own while keeping true to the original. Fans of Babylon AD will certainly not be disappointed!"
__label__2	Jabra EarGels: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use.
__label__1	Not worth the $2.99: I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.
__label__1	Glad they were under ten bucks.: Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them.
__label__1	Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.
__label__2	Good Deal: Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping.
__label__2	Jabra Eargels: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. The set consists of 3 pairs of eargel (three sizes). Found the size that fit and inserted the ICON. Works OK, but not as snug as I would like on my right ear. Tried the left ear one and it was much better; fit was better and sound was louder. Tried several types of earphone adapters, and these seem to work better than most. If you have a problem with fit on one ear, try the other one.
__label__2	the keep my icon and my jabra extreme where they belong.: Works great, fits better. Works with a range of headsets. I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme. The gels are comfortable, and fit quite well. Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel. Th ese are almost the well fitting. Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months, but for the price I can live with that.
__label__1	Completely Worthless: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.
__label__2	Jabra ear gel: Product works perfectly with jawbone 2. Ease of use without needing to change anything on ear peice. Will need to decrease volume when using the nanda ear gel. Getting good fit easy with the differen sizes provided. Soft material makes comfortable for extended use , and no need for the ear loop.
__label__1	Junk,Don't wast your money.: I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit.
__label__2	Jabra EarGels: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.
__label__2	Makes a Jawbone 2 better: I hated the fit of my Jawbone 2.0. It would never stay in no matter which ear loop or ear bud I used. Someone recommended these to me, so I thought I'd give them a try. After 2 months of using it, I'm pissed I didn't get them sooner. Before chucking your Jawbone 2.0, try these.
__label__2	great product: people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them
__label__1	THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS.: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.
__label__1	POOR: GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.
__label__2	Great Item: I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people. My only gripe is that they don't fit every single diffrent headset out there. They worked great for mine but I need a new one and I noticed that only about half of the bluetooth headsets out there will fit these.
__label__1	Preset sizes just don't fit: The title says it all. Preset sizes of the EarGels just don't fit my ears. The tube that directs sound does not go in my ear canal far enough and the hook that is supposed to hold the unit in your ear will not hold it in mine. None of the 3 sizes of gels made a difference.Try before you buy if possible.
__label__1	Didn't fit: Although good quality product, it doesn't fit my ear at all. None of the sizes fit comfortably or snug. I can't use it at all and just wasted my money.
__label__1	Doesn't fit well at all, hard to get into ear.: I bought these to help with what I've read, to get the Jawbone to fit better. These ear pieces were hard to get into the ear no matter what size I tried. For a wireless earpiece you want to be able to get it on and off your ear quick if you need to, and these prevent you from doing so.
__label__1	Not for my application: I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. The gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. These may be OK but not for my application.
__label__2	You only need 1 size: I cannot find where to buy my size and which ear I use my eargel. What in the world are you supposed to do with 3 sizes and 3 sides when you most likely will only use 1 size and 1 side??The product is comfortable and without the use of a boom mike makes this product number 1, except for being able to buy the right size eargel replacements.
__label__1	"Not a trustworthy company: I bought two sets of these. They're priced at $9.50. But, when they arrived, the price tag still stuck on the item says $2.99. Nice way to hide your ""shippign cost"" ($6.51) from your customers! This company goes on my ""Never Again"" list!"
__label__1	"Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the ""flap"" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these."
__label__1	waste of money: Absolute waste of money. What arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.I left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.Given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however I would never buy from these guys again.Am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.
__label__1	didn't fit my ears: Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims...
__label__1	Way too large!: Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.
__label__1	To Big: These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.
__label__2	excellent vendor: eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
__label__1	Great for a few weeks: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.
__label__1	Not compatible with Jawbone Icon: With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.
__label__1	Terrible design: I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
__label__1	Ear Gels: None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.
__label__1	JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone.
__label__2	Much needed: I bought these to go with the Jawbone 2 because the ear piece they use will not stay in your ear and the loops that go over your ear just does not fit.These are great and they set in your ear nicely.
__label__2	Jabra Eargels Great Help for my Jawbone II: While I loved the sound of my Jawbone II headset, it would not remain secured with the eargels provided. These Jabra eargels work wonderfully and keep the headset comfortably and securely in my ear.
__label__2	Solid upgrade for Jawbone: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.
__label__1	Not for me...: These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device.
__label__1	Worthless: None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
__label__1	They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered.: DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	How is this supposed to work?: I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.
__label__1	"Not Recommended: I only have one word to say about it...""NOT RECOMMENDED""...but still you can go ahead & waste your $ 10 to find out...Good Luck"
__label__2	"So much better than ""over the ear"": I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'."
__label__2	Fits perfectly on my Jawbone headset: I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended.
__label__1	bad fit, way too big: Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears.Jabra EarGels - ClearI suppose in theory they should work to channel the sound into your ear, but that's only if the pieces fits into your ear, I didn't get a chance to test that aspect.
__label__1	Waste of money: This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
__label__1	Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe: In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic.
__label__2	I can hear!: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments. If you work or play anywhere it is loud, you need these! I have since upgraded these to a custom earpiece, but if I hadn't gotten the Jabra's, I most likely would have chucked the Jawbone as unusable!
__label__1	don't buy: these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
__label__1	Waste of money: These ear gels were supposed to fit easily on the Jabra Bluetooth that I have, but they don't stay on at all once they were placed on it. I was hoping the contoured shape would hold in my ears, but it just proved to be very uncomfortable.
__label__1	Total Waste of Money: Not one of the ear gels worked. Feel like I got ripped off. The ear gels are headed to the trash can where they belong.
__label__1	Does not fit jawbone 2 very well: I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. They did not fit very well and were very loose. I use the small size and they did not fit very well. The medium and large size do not fit my ear canal. Too bad as I need an in-ear bluetooth to hear well. I guess I will have to look for something else.
__label__1	not compatable with the jawbone.: produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
__label__1	They fit nicely in the ear, but don't work so well with jawbone: I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.
__label__2	Works well with the Samsung WEP200: I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn't get them to stay in. these made it work!
__label__2	Works well and comfortably.: I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size.
__label__2	Instructions on how to use with Jawbone: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.
__label__2	I need two sizes!: I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)
__label__1	Jabra Ear Gels: I ordered the ear gels to go with my Jawbone Bluetooth headset. The problem that I see is that the ear gels are too bulky when combined with the Jawbone.
__label__2	Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets.: Excellent product. I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.
__label__1	Stick it in your ear!: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]
__label__1	Liked the ear piece: I quess I ordered the wrong ones, did not fit my ear piece well. I've never been able to find any other pieces for this particular ear piece so I quess I just have to trash it.
__label__2	BULK PACKAGING: These came in a tiny ziploc bag with no retail label. Not as big a deal as had this issue been instead with the headset that they are going with, but still... It'd have been nice to have known what to expect.
__label__1	Thanks for nothing, Jabra: Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons
__label__1	useless: For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product.
__label__1	Far from perfect...: I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed.
__label__1	Does not fit Jawbone Era: The specs for this product state that it universally fits all Jawbone headsets. It does not. It does not fit the Jawbone Era.
__label__2	"Eargels for Jawbone retrofit: Using the Jabra eargels over my Jawbone.I can omit the ear hook, and it sounds much better than the manufacture's product.Looks a little scary out of the ear, but ears are not a ""manufactured item""."
__label__2	Good: I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
__label__1	These are not the answer to Jawbone Noise Asason: While Jawbone make a great blue tooth ear bud, it doesn't interface with ears well. The Jabra solution doesn't work. It doesn't hold the ear bud well allowing it to fall off at the most inconvieniant times. It also hurts your ear and is difficult to insert. It's not the answer, friends.
__label__2	GREAT: The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are. Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..
__label__1	"These don't work with Jabra BT250v headsets: I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine."
__label__1	Jabra clear gel - useless: These were said to work great with the Jawbone blue tooth headset. They don't, are almost impossible to put on and do not stay on the headset. I think they are useless for the Jawbone.
__label__2	Very good.: These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras?
__label__1	Old and yellowed: Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again.
__label__1	Ripoff ! Don't Buy From CMMA Accessories !: I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund. Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !
__label__2	Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.
__label__2	Very functional, not very pretty: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.
__label__2	It's a keeper!: I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic.
__label__1	"Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION: The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
__label__1	Poor excuse for a great story: I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey.
__label__2	"Mythological Fiction: This film is one of the better of this genre--due to the casting, and the more ""true to life and literature"" approach that is taken. The characters seem much more ""human."" Enough sexual content, albeit well done, to preclude viewing by even teenagers. Homer's story is followed pretty faithfully, too, from my distant memories. But the real ""excellence"" is in the acting."
__label__1	Oh boy... dont let this spoil your opinion of Homer: The origional creater of The Odyssey, Homer, did a wonderful job producing an action-packed story where you cared about the characters and made you eager to know what would happen next. Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...
__label__1	absolutely HORRIBLE: I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer.
__label__1	"Cmon ""honors"" people!: the movie was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. alice's was good, those were her words, but kayla, jana...we were all there when noteboom said what you wrote and you're taking credit for it? please!"
__label__2	Excellent, Exhilirating, and Fun: And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS.
__label__2	Great translation from print to screen! Worth buying a copy: It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. No viewing time not well-spent with the lavish production design, brilliant acting, and not-off-tangent-from-literature screenplay. I hope they release a DVD version right away.
__label__1	"WOW: Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
__label__1	Uhh..... Were they stoned?: This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!
__label__1	Uggh: Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew
__label__1	Mullets across the Med: I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney.
__label__1	More like a NEGATIVE 3: This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!
__label__1	I agree: I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is
__label__1	coulda been betta!!!!!!!!: the special effects sucked and we've seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of movies we've seen it was pretty crap. it was realy BORING! (...) we've seen and weve seen heaps of them and some of them were realy gory over all COULDA BEEN BETTA!!!!!
__label__1	"Blech: This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
__label__2	Still compelling after 3000 years.: Homer would have endorsed this rendering of his tale. Full of wonderful special effects, gorgeous Mediterranean vistas, and gods and goddesses who look their parts, this movie is still driven by personalities. The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters. There is a reason that Homer's story still reaches us after 3000 years, and this telling does justice to its ancient material.
__label__2	adventurous. suspenseful. mythological.: The Odyssey was about the greek hero Odysseus' journey home from his victory of the trojan war. He encounters many perils on his voyage. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FANTASY , THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.
__label__2	kewl!: The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking.
__label__1	THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful
__label__1	Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too.: NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****
__label__1	Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny: Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked.
__label__2	Odyssey (VHS): I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. I ordered it the day before Thanksgiving, and it was shipped out to me the Friday after. It arrived in good condition in plenty of time for me to review before using it in the class room.
__label__1	Agonizingly Long: Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating.
__label__1	Movie is awesome. Service comperable to Wal-Mart: I already know that I will love the movie. The problem is, shpping is and always has been a deceit. Even f you pay for next day (Prime Member), you will not get it on time. There is no other solution for law-abiding people.
__label__2	The odyssey: I thought that the Odyssey was a very good movie.It was well put together, and had great acting.The effects of the movie were average.I especially enjoyed the scenes with the cyclops.Although its a very interesting movie I believe that it is too long, and the audience/viewers gets bored.In general I thought that it was a great movie that was educational, and was very succesful.By Josh 7R.
__label__2	"Reasonable interpretation of a classic: When you start with such good material, it's hard to please everyone. Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" many reviewers are disappointed that the movie didn't match their own visions of a great book. (Notice how no one ever complains that ""Goldfinger"" or other Bond movies are significantly different from the Ian Fleming novels?) Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects ""good enough."" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special ""Walking with Odysseus!"" Sheesh!"
__label__2	Good: I saw this movie for first time having missed it when it first aired. I thought the special effects were amazing and my favorite sequence was the cyclops. The scene where the ship goes over the edge was very amazing, after that the story just seemed to grind to a halt. Much to long and boring after the first hour and a half. But well worth the rental if you like special effects.
__label__1	Great book; terrible movie: if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!
__label__2	"Homer's enchanting tale: Homer's enchanting tale is brought to life in ""The Odyssey.""I, a student, first saw this movie while studying Ancient Greece with my class. On the first day of Ancient Greece, my teacher popped the video in the VCR and made us take catagorized notes.Since it was our first day we had no idea about Greece's history, gods and goddesses, heroes or political science.However, the Odyssey told my class and I a great deal about Greece.One of the reasons why I reccommend this movie, is your (or your child, for that matter) don't know too much on Ancient Greece, you put the movie in the VCR, and 2 hours done with the credits rolling, you will know so much about Ancient Greece.It occured to me that in this movie The Odyssey about Odysseus leaving Ithaca for the Trojan war and fight the curse of Poseidon, underneath it all there is the political science and the goddesses and gods history and way of life and the scenery.Over all this is an amazing movie."
__label__2	Great for the classroom: This video is great to use as a resource for teaching The Odyssey. The students find the video entertaining and helpful. However, the movie does not exactly follow the original Odyssey. Of course, the directors took some creative liberty on certain scenes. On the whole, the movie does a great job in giving students an account of the journey of Odysseus.
__label__2	Good: I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often. However, I loved it as a movie, not necessarily as an adaptation of The Odyssey, which is one of my favorite books.
__label__1	"NOT a good representation of Homer: I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."
__label__1	Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century: It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind.
__label__1	"OMG! worst movie ever!: haha . . . wow this is one of those movies that is so completly bad that its funny. ok 1st of all Odysseus accent changes in almost every scene. 2nd penelope pronounces telemachos different than Odysseus. 3rd telemachos sounds like a whiney english boy. 4th posiedon ""the god of the wine dark sea"" is a face in a wave. 5th anitkleia is just freaky. 6th Odysseus beard changes color. 7th the cow scene wasnt even in there. 8th THEY NEVER LET PENELOPE HAVE HER REVENGE! 9th telemachos cant do any thing but then amazingly he can throw 2 spears at once. 10th Aoilos sounds like a cartoon. 11th the characters are all supposed to be bueatiful but they are all ugly . . . and i can go on. NOTEBOOMS 1/2 ROX! haha SPACE NEEDLE!"
__label__1	Lord, have mercy!: If this movie were worse (and if it COULD be) there would undoubtedly be an unhealthy number of premature deaths .... First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say. Just DON'T watch this movie before (or even after) you read the book, unless you wish to perish at an unnaturally early stage in life!!!!!!!!GOODBYE!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Awful, just awful: Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.
__label__1	Who be dissin on our noteboom?: Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself.
__label__2	Falwed but Fun none the less: I love Greek History and mythology. When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time.
__label__2	Out of date, but good: _Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children.
__label__2	The ONLY translation of Schure's play...: **This is the only book that Schure's masterful drama is given in an English translation.**This book is so rare, and I mean so rare that I had to go to a small town called Dornach in Switzerland to find it!!!And of course, it is out-of-print, and so unknown that it will probably never be re-printed again in history....not to say even performed, unless a Schure enthusiast like myself undertakes a task like that!This is the play that the philosopher Rudolf Steiner took as the model to his own 4 Mystery Dramas. Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner. A wonder and deep inspirational experience.
__label__2	My son loves it: Great language, humor and wonderful story telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell's books. Always enjoy reading them. I got thisfor my son on his 11th birthday. I think it will also help himgreatly improve his vocabulary.
__label__2	My family and other animals: I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!
__label__2	works great: This mold is great for what I need. Chocolate pops right out of the plastic. would buy again if needed
__label__1	Can't get worse: This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
__label__1	"Nauseating: In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
__label__2	"The Coolest: I wore this shirt to work one Friday (casual day) and one the my co-workers told me ""I've worked here 7 years and that is the coolest shirt I've ever seen."" Need I say more."
__label__2	Two fro the price of one: This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. The first half is what I consider a small Big Band. With other Sax players, trumpets and guitar. The second half is the Rollins Trio. With that said I simply Love this CD., Grand Street is my favorite song, it instantly lights up the whole room. The sound is tight and powerful. I do prefer the first half with it's rich full sound. The second half is good but less attention getting. The playing however is excellent. For a great mix of styles and sound on one CD your cannot lose with this one.
__label__2	Excellent Product: This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods. The only issue is that you can't get it too hot; if you want to add it to soup, you've got to let it cool a bit first.
__label__1	Bad memory leakes: The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. The only problem I've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo. If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management. The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it wouldn't happen again. Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try. I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue.
__label__2	ORIGINAL SURF MUSIC FROMTHE 60'S: THE IMPACTS WERE ANOTHER SOCAL SURF BAND FROM THE EARLY 60'S THAT USED TO PLAY AT THE BALBOA BALLROOM ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER GREAT BANDS FROM THAT TIME (DICK DALE AND THE DEL-TONES, THE CROSSFIRES, SENTINALS, TORNADOS, AND A LOT OF OTHER ONES AS WELL.) AND RECORDED ON THE LOCAL DEL-FI LABEL ON LOW BUDGET RECORDS. THIS IS A GREAT CD OF EARLY 60'S SURF MUSIC, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF WIPE OUT.
__label__1	RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris: Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks.
__label__1	Mirror came damaged and late: After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
__label__1	dont buy from them: They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. Thier 1-800 # will not let you talk to any one. I left messages and no response. I real close to file a complaint with the BBB. Dont buy.LB
__label__1	below average: I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it.
__label__2	Good Concert: Always been a Cocker fan and this one will not disappoint. Given the age of this concert the sound and picture quality is OK...would rock in blue ray however!
__label__2	Good DVD: Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!
__label__2	great show, worth buying: Great audio and video with many hits. Only gripe would be that they turned up the audience clapping very loudly after each song and a little too loudly during the songs. This is only a small criticism, however. Buy this DVD.
__label__2	Useful: Needed for class. It got the job done. Interesting book and I'm glad I had to read it. Would recommend.
__label__1	"Bait & Switch - Completely misleading picture: I too got taken in by the ""coiled"" picture. I got a curly cable, not the straight cable pictured ""in a coil."" Completely misleading, I lost my $3.99 that I paid for next day shipping from Prime as well! Total bait & switch. I didn't read the one review on it. Now there are two. This cable is actually about 2 feet long with the coil."
__label__2	This is a keeper for sure: I have personally used this edition of the Psalms for quite a while. Because I enjoy it so much I have purchased several copies for friends
__label__2	"rated comparatively with Wilbur's others: i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."
__label__1	The Diamond Hunters: This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either.
__label__1	The Diamond Hunters: Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. I would rate his Monsoon and the early Courtney triliogy as 4-5 stars.
__label__1	The Diamaond Hunters: When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth.
__label__1	Totally Unbelievable Tale: This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.
__label__2	Less than Smith is capable of doing.: Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover.
__label__2	Love Wilbur Smith: What a great writer. Wilbur Smith could write about wallpaper and I would find it interesting. I just wish more of his books were available on Kindle since I will no longer by a paperback....
__label__1	Poorly Made: What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
__label__2	Dangerous Mail Service: So often we see in westerns the stagecoach roaring into town and well-dressed easterners get out--not even dusty. This book shows the real and extremely difficult days of the stagecoach mail delivery and does it in a very factual, well-documented way. The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities. It was especially interesting to me since my father and brother have the same name--Ben Holladay. He may be a distant relative and we would be proud to claim him.
__label__2	Very Action packed and cool: I like this movie. I like the part when Moby Dick attacks. I think the captain is weird.
__label__2	In good condition: Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.
__label__1	"I was rooting for the whale in this one: Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
__label__1	1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles: So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.
__label__2	"Why is Fedellah Asian?: I love the book, Moby Dick. Yes, that does make me a freak of nature.One of my favorite characters is Ahab's harpooner/attendant demon Fedellah who was completely ignored in the John Huston/Ray Bradbury movie version, but, alas and alack, this Fedellah not only does not have a great white mane worn like a turban on his ""Persian"" head in this movie but he is a bald Asian with a Fu Man Chu mustache.I know. Picky, picky, picky. And Flask has a pipe not Stubb. Alas. Still, it has fairly wonderful production values and if you don't have a Fedellah fetish, you'll probably like this one. Queequeg rocks."
__label__2	Overall, an excellent movie.: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not having read Melville's book, this movie gave me much more of an understanding of Ahab and his tortured soul than the Gregory Peck version. Excellent acting by Stewart and the rest of the cast. My only complaint is with Moby Dick himself - the rubber whale used in the scenes is not very convincing.
__label__2	Highly entertaining: I guess I'm in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining.
__label__1	"A pitiful excuse for a movie: If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
__label__2	"Moby Dick: Movie was great but the sub-titles were ""off"" and distracting (but hilarious at times!) Just finished reading the book, and the movie was pretty acurate. Anything with Patrick Stewart is ""quality"" in my book and I wasn't disappointed here. It was great to include Gregory Peck, also, and liked the special features with him after the movie."
__label__1	"Patrick Stewart and the 7 Dwarfs: Boy, what a lousy Moby Dick! Patrick Stewart is terrific. That is it, period. The effects with the whale are fine, but when the cabin boy is drowning, the water is only up to his chest. When will the REAL Moby Dick be on DVD? Now that the Coen Brothers have paid tribute with the ending of ""Oh Brother"", one can get one's hopes up again. Save your money for that."
__label__1	Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!: Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!
__label__1	TERRIBLE MOVIE: What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!
__label__2	"awesome: I thought Patrick Stewart did a fantastic job. He showed great feeling towards ""The great white whale"". I have seen this movie 3 times and I still enjoy watching it. It was much better than I was expecting. I wish this movie had been around years ago when I had to read the book in school, it would have given me a better perspective of it. also it would have made the book easier to read. I loved the movie!"
__label__1	"Classics never die!: If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only."
__label__1	"Simply awful: I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
__label__2	Round Perditions Flames: I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Though the film looses a star for the quite dodgy special effects, Herman Mellville's story and A cast of great actors lift it up into a classic.
__label__1	Weak remake: I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
__label__1	DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM,SEE THE HOUSTON 1956 ONE!: Between lousy directing, and pointless wide camera angles, and a total disreagard to the book, (Unlike previous film and TV episodics) this was so bad, that I forced myself to sit through the entire video, just to see if it ever got better, or resembled the book in any way. I don't think anyone read the book on this production, or even bothered to read the cliff notes. A real waste of the actor's time, and ours.
__label__1	DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION: It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something.
__label__1	strong smell of oil: This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
__label__2	Favorably impressed!: This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one.
__label__1	Long term owner: Had this for 3 years. It isn't much to look at, doesn't heat as strong as Delonghi TRD0715T i own. But worst of all it started to leek on the second year. ..Not recommended..
__label__2	good heat, cheap wheels: I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). While assembling the wheels, one literally shattered in my hands. I brought it back for a new one and the same thing happened. The third one assembled fine, and the store gave me 3 spare wheels, just in case. I don't know if I would have shipped two of them back to Amazon.It throws quite a bit of heat for such a small unit. We bought this to replace an older radiator of the same design and the difference is striking. I also noted a bit of an oil smell, but that went away after a few uses. All in all, a good heater, but
__label__1	Poor Product: This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours.
__label__1	Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting....: The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!
__label__1	"Pretty Corny: I've read several other Deborah Smith books. In my opinion Blue Willow was the best. Sweet Hush was by far the corniest book, I've read in a long time. The phrase ""Sweet Hush"" must have been at used at least 100 times in the book. The main character ""Hush"" was predictable and one dimentional. If you enjoy Deborah Smith books, I would skip this one."
__label__2	One of the best from Deborah Smith: I have enjoyed a few books from this author, but this one, was one of my favorites. I could not put it down to see where the story line was going and I was not disappointed! Love the strong characters and the flow of the story.
__label__2	Deborah Smith: Read her, you will enjoy your time with her characters. Strong women, strong men, some bizarre quirks in lots of characters.
__label__2	Great Book: This book is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader. I laughed out loud while reading because Ms Smith uses comical pharses I have grown up hearing. This is an awesome book.
__label__1	review by Tarek musslimani: This is an absolutely not useful book. It is not understood at all and it is written so that no body can understand it but the author himself. So I do not recommend for you to buy it. Please save your money.TM
__label__2	excellent book: In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening.
__label__1	A nice companion to McQuarrie's text: I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book.
__label__2	No better place to start with Stat Mech: If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists
__label__2	great handbook: i'm a student of applied chemistry and this book has everything you need too know as undergraduate of statistical thermodynamics
__label__1	Don't Bother: Don't bother. It is next to impossible to get this product to work. Tried everything (USB, download driver, etc.) and nothing worked - with XP Pro. ended up in the trash.
__label__1	Dreadful.: Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful.
__label__1	A disappointment: Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed.
__label__1	"Not my cup of tea: This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never ""come clean"" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?"
__label__2	Perry is now two times as classy!: William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon
__label__1	This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever.: To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander.
__label__2	"Sho and Jean are good together: When I first saw this movie had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it.I knew that Sho was.Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good.JCVD really out classed Sho in this one.I give them both 10's anyway.The way that they interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie will like this one.It's not just a martial arts movie."
__label__1	Boring. Watch at your own risk.: Lets cut to the chase. If u want a better van damm movie. Watch no retreat no surrender. As for this one.save it for a day u got nothing better to do.its a time killer. If your just sitting around.lets get to the point.watch this one only if u need a time killer. If u want a movie with the sickest fights watch guyver2 .yall love it.and this one shelve it.
__label__1	Van Damme gives the best performance,: which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though.
__label__1	worst action movie ever: Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie
__label__1	Van Damme's a Bad Guy ?: I would say the plot is good, but the action and fighting scenes are not in favour for action-movie goers.
__label__1	"Where did the producers put all the money in Black Eagle?: First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this movie is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph! Plus the dvd features are limited and there is NO ""Making of..."" feature, only a theatrical trailer and some production notes (too short). Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD."
__label__1	Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting: Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
__label__1	I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt.
__label__2	Little dated, but great: Zaller turns our perception of polling data on its ear. People don't think about most issues until they are asked, so opinion surveying might actually do more to shape opinions than actually report on them.
__label__1	"Didn't work...I have to start again: My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
__label__2	Flea control: This is a great product and I have used it for years. It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control.
__label__1	create your own flea circus: I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well.
__label__2	good product: Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. thanks for the good deal
__label__2	Adequate: The springs on this hanger are a bit tight. It will accomodate plates of the sizes indicated. I have purchased other holders that are more flexible, and will hold a wider range of sizes. All in all, it does the job.
__label__2	Blues-psych, somewhat like Cream: 1969 blues-psych. Reminds me of Cream though not as good. Singer is Scottish and really has the accent at times. Good if you like this type of music.
__label__2	Great Acid Rock!: Haven't purchased this, but having listened to the whole album, I sure will!. I suggest any fan of acid rock/heavy psych, hard rock, classic rock, blues rock, or early heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath get this album today.
__label__2	SOLID METAL!!: Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! m/m/
__label__1	A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran: This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not.
__label__2	Great Cards: This is an amazing deck of cards. They are very easy to use with some practice and you can fool anyone into thinking you are a true magician. This is a great buy for anyone who likes card tricks. It is lots of fun.
__label__2	great for the price: Bought this for my husband for christmas. He has a MATTHEWS switchback compound bow. It fits nicely in this case without having to remove the quiver from bow. Has velcro ties to hold bow on bottom, sits on top of padding. Top has section to hold your arrows. Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside. Very good case for the cheap price.
__label__2	would be 4.6 out of 5: For a cheap bow case, it really lives up to its name. I've traveled a few times to test it out and no problems what so ever! You get what u paid for.I have a mission craze bow and it fits well. There's room for everything i need to put in it!Cons and Problems-A little flimsy and doesn't seem too sturdy. And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy.
__label__2	Plano Compact Bow Case: For the price its an excellent bow case. Not made for abuse. Don't know how it would do as baggage on an airline flight tho.
__label__2	Excellent: The book which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking book by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. It is both intelligent and entertaining, as a book on popular music should be. Highly recommended.
__label__2	"Great latin disco: I have only gotten interested in disco in the last few years, but now I am a huge fan. some of my faves include: Salsoul 12"", P&P Records Best of, Disco Connection Series, best of WestEnd, & 12"" Grand Series. However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers. Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music."
__label__2	"Not quite Gone with the Wind.: It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."
__label__2	Wonderful!: I first read this book in 1962. Today, I can remember the characters as if I had read the book yesterday. A beautiful love story written in a gentler time. A story that will tear at your heart and conscience. Very moving!
__label__1	inside not as good as the cover: The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes.
__label__2	A book that long? Are you kidding me?: Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list.
__label__1	Weak: This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better.
__label__1	Sad: Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help.
__label__1	"It drags: I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile."
__label__1	Mercedes wrote this?: I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!
__label__1	Dishonest!: A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.
__label__2	Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History: Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment.
__label__2	JUST GREAT: So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back.
__label__1	Ok at best: I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book.
__label__1	This book has already been written: Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!
__label__1	Too many cooks: The book had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. The characters were as flat as the paper they were writen on. The authors collaboration worked as well as a mixture of a heavy smoker in a fireworks factory. It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor. If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous. I enjoyed other works by the authors and am severly disapointed in this collaboration.
__label__1	This is Merovingian Nights ,not a new book: mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery.
__label__2	Fantastic!: Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!
__label__2	Tells of a Venice where magic is alive: Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint & Dave Freer's Shadow Of The Lion is set in 1537 and tells of a Venice where magic is alive and two vagabond brothers are posed to influence its changes. A monster has been loosed on the city; and it's up to an unlikely band of individuals to join in defeating the danger.
__label__1	an OK read, but not what I expected: I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them. It has alot of plot & story, and it can be difficult to keep track of at times. Its not a BAD read, its just... very busy, with many many many characters. It was an OK read, but not what I expected.
__label__2	Wonderful book: I love this book, it has different kinds of projects that you'll enjoy, and the charts are neat, I love it!!!!!!
__label__1	Disappointing: Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy.
__label__2	"Unheard talent: Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their ""Heart Of The Ages"" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia."
__label__2	Keeping Irelands History Alive Through Song: This CD captures the essence of how the Irish Soldier, during the War Between The States, passed on their history from Ireland. Prison Ships is an EXCELLENT song telling us how the Irish were persecuted and sent far from their homes to Australia. This is a great original effort along with Soldier Boys, Angelus Bells, Welcome, and the title track Rock of Erin. I think the 69th Pa did a superb job with their first effort. ALL proceeds go towards Civil War Battlefield Preservation and Educational Projects that the 69th Pa are well known. This CD is a pleasant change from the other Civil War CDs available. If you like traditional Irish Music, this one is a MUST. Keep up the good work.
__label__1	"A couple of positives. . .: . . .but not nearly enough to counter the negatives.First the positives:1) Some brilliant photography. One just can't get around this.2) Some truly likeable characters and character development -- especially several of the minor characters.There! That is two stars worth!Negatives:1) Spotty directing, which offsets the quality of the photography2) No earthly resemblance at all to the (true) book from which the story is supposed to have been taken3) A boring, and over-the-top gay agenda (along with any one of a number of similar ""far-left"" issues, poorly cobbled together4) A view of the Virgin Mary, which, while not openly portrayed offensively in the film, is bound, nonetheless to offendIn short, the bad outweighs the good. Skip this one."
__label__1	This is a bad one: This is a really bad movie. The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona. This film entirely misses the point of the book and I just hope the author was well paid for allowing her book to be associated with this awful movie.
__label__1	Terrible: Typical Hollywood movie trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. This movie is slow and does not even make much sense at all. Hopefully most people do not live like this and if they do they would be considered weird.Do not waste your time with this movie!
__label__1	Under the tuscan sun: to be honest I expected a little more from the movie. it was too mellow and somewhat boring.
__label__2	leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this movie at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this movie. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on thier luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. I laughed, I cried several times this movie evoked that youthful part inside me that needs to be awakened every so often. With the beautiful cinematography and portrayal of the people you want to leave your seat and hop a plane for Tuscany. I heard so many people saying that as they left the theatre. Go see this movie and laugh and cry all at the same time.
__label__1	A great idea!: Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery.
__label__1	Stinks: This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
__label__1	Disappointing: Having read Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this movie was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful story became a run of the mill chick flick. As beautiful as the scenery was, the movie made Tuscany lose it's charm and warmth that I received in the book.
__label__2	Very Uplifting and Fun: I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring.
__label__2	Heart warming movie: I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.
__label__1	YAWN!: I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book; however, the movie shares only a passing resemblance to the book. It gets 2 stars because I enjoy Diane Lane and Tuscany is gorgeous, but other than that the movie was dull, Lane's character is nothing short of pathetic, and the ending is trite.
__label__1	Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.: Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book.
__label__2	Enjoyable escapism: Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!
__label__2	Movie night: Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase.
__label__1	Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual.
__label__1	The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!: Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read.
__label__1	Terrible stinker!: What a stupid movie! There was nothign admirable in the main character. What the heck was she thinking in sleeping with a man she hadn't even known for a day! That is not realistic at all. The whole storyline had no logical sequence. Stay away from this movie.
__label__2	Good Movie: I love the full screen edition of the movie. I do not like the movies that is half screen. I like this movie because it reminds me that there is life after divorce or any other life altering event. But we have to move forward to achieve it.
__label__1	Couldn't Watch: I have been looking for this movie for a long while. It came and I put it in to watch it; it stopped playing 3/4 of the way through!!! I tried it in all of our devices and it did the same thing each time! Very disappointed!!!
__label__2	A Very Pleasant Story: Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
__label__2	Feel Good Movie: Absolutely loved this movie. Great message ... unbelievably good things can happen ... even later in life. Breathtaking views of Italy ... This movie never loses its magic.
__label__1	If you read the book, don't watch the movie!: I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me.
__label__1	If you liked the book, you will not like this film.: Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film.
__label__2	The biggest surprise of the year! This film is a marvel!: We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are. It sure makes a great date movie - Under The Tuscan Sun is a marvel!
__label__1	Guys miss this one: Gentlemen miss this movie. As a married man I am consigned to the fact that I must watch certain movies that are geared towards the ladies, I am okay with that. Having suffered through most of said type of movies, I can say that this particular movie is a truly a painful experience without any humor to help. All this movie does is follow a sad and lonely woman around Italy and waste the two hours that is the movie running time. Do not buy this movie for the lady in your life because then you will be forced to watch it.
__label__2	One of the best chick flicks ever: Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!
__label__2	Relationships in Tuscany: This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!
__label__2	Quite a change from the book: Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume.
__label__1	Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot: Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?
__label__2	"Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon: This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just ""fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you"". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment."
__label__2	Great Movie: My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!
__label__2	Great movie for you and your gal friends to watch together!: Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!
__label__2	Enjoyable & Light: When I go to the movies, I go to relax and enjoy a break from everday life. Who cares if it is realisitc or not. Being a romantic comedy buff, I found this movie entertaining and refreshing. Anyone who wants to enjoy a light movie will enjoy this film.
__label__1	Boring!!!: This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. I could see the potential for comedy, but it just wasn't there. Maybe it's Diane Lane or maybe it's the director. I kept wondering if Lane was playing a teenager or an adult. I couldn't get involved with the character at all. She seemed to be faking it all the way through. I would've given no stars, but I thought the Italian countryside deserved at least 1 star.
__label__2	Charming surprise...: This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day.
__label__2	Opposing View of Divorce: The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets.
__label__1	Undercover?: I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth.
__label__2	Good flick: Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less.
__label__1	Boring: This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it.
__label__1	Are you KIDDING ME????: Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller book to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. What a shame! While I liked Diane Lane I was completely disappointed in this movie.
__label__1	Boring, Drawn Out Movie: I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER.
__label__2	Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines!: A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie.
__label__2	Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining: Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!
__label__1	"Stupid movie: I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story had no sense of direction. It seemed too badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were just adding more things as they went along, saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the married real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
__label__1	"If it was not for Diane Lane....: If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as ""romantic comedy"", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!"
__label__1	Tuscany steals the show: This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up.In short, I think ANY movie would benefit from being set and shot in Tuscany Italy. This one did. Without the beautiful backdrop - I don't think I would have watched the whole thing. A patchwork story-line, left me with the feeling that it had a lot of interesting bits and pieces BUT it appeared that they were put together for no apparent reason.It just wasn't believable.Maybe rent it
__label__1	Diane Lane feast...: Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere.
__label__1	Ho-Hum: One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!
__label__1	barely cosi cosi (so so): This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book.
__label__1	"Cute but typical: So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
__label__2	Great movie!: Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role.
__label__1	Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.
__label__1	not worthy to be a chick flick: First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first.
__label__1	"Gutless garbage: ""Under The Tuscan Sun"": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."
__label__1	A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE': Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative. Lets just say that if you want to see Diane Lane at her best, Unfaithful is a better bet.If you enjoy film that insults your intellect while shooting pretty scenes country side, then by all means enjoy!
__label__1	Trite, weak, thin, fake, demeaning,: The story is probably a wonderful love story; but, to get there you must suffer through the paper-thin character of a woman with no depth, no self, no mind..., or an actor who cannot portray a woman worth watching and not worthy of real love.
__label__1	"Families / Christians BEWARE: I rented this movie thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean movie that I could enjoy watching. However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of ""If it feels good, do it."" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."
__label__1	Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.
__label__1	"Good Fun?: This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
__label__2	A Woman finds herself in Italy: Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed. Her best friend realizes this and because of her pregnancy cannot go with her lover on a romantic tour of Tuscany, so they offer her the tickets for the trip instead.At first Francis does not want to go to Italy, but eventually decides to go. She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over
__label__2	Is this really a 'chick flick'??????: I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy.....Diane Lane is a favorite of mine. Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all.
__label__1	IS OK...I GUESS: THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE.
__label__2	Not Bad...for a chick flick: Interesting!! This film takes place in Italy and surrounds itself with a character who recently gets divorced, and finds herself, at the urging of her friends (who happen to be gay) to get away from it all and take sometime to herself...little do they all know (including her) that she ends up going out there, and never coming back to the States to live. This is a story of a woman who is looking for more in life than just the normal basic stuff. She wants to live her life to the fullest and really enjoy what the world has to offer her. Good film, great message for all!!
__label__2	Under the Tuscan Sun: If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico.
__label__2	Diane Lane and Under The Tuscan Sun: This is a good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as Julia Robert's feminist 'Mona Lisa Smile' and being sometimes confused with that film by critics. This is not a feminist, male-bashing movie. And it isn't entirely a 'chic flick' either. Diane Lane is apparently very picky about the roles she plays and the films she appears in. This is another good choice for her.There are plenty of reviews here telling what this film is about. I'll simply tell you that I bought the DVD for my wife, but I usually watch it with her. It is a good movie.
__label__2	Uplifting and Beautiful: The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting.
__label__1	OH MY GOD!: One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???
__label__1	Make Sure the Format is in Your Region: I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed.
__label__2	"Lightweight but enjoyable: A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a ""Mediterranean"" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la ""This Old House.""OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."
__label__1	"For MEN only: maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
__label__1	"Under the Tuscan Sun: This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we're supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn't ""get"" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the 'man' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a 'family' that our protagonist always wanted in theory. Gimmie a break. This movie rates one star because the scale doesn't go lower."
__label__1	Boooring.....: This was the most boring movie and the most wretched performance I have ever seen from Diane Lane. All she did was sigh through the first 45 minutes.
__label__2	It was pretty good, but could have been better.: I gave this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie. However, it is quite depressing at times. Diane Lane just can't catch a break. It is kinda slow, but I'm very pleased to have seen it.
__label__2	A really fun, smart and sexy movie!: This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!
__label__2	The most entertaining film of the year: This movie was so entertaining. I was in stitches from laughing so much - it was so funny and enjoyable. Diane Lane was incredible in this film. She is such a good actress and here she proves that she is funny as well. This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year. Brilliant stuff!
__label__1	wrong formAt: I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
__label__2	Beautiful story!: This movie is based loosely on the true story of France Mayes. It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery. All of the characters are perfect!I also stumbled on to a daily planner based on the story... filled with gorgeous pics and quotes, stories, and recipes from Frances. So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!
__label__2	delightful and quirky: I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Anyone who has ever undergone a painful divorce will relate to this movie. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I did not feel that Lane's acting was overdone. The angst of betrayal and divorce is just that, angst.The movie also had its delightfully quirky moments and while it was heavily salted and peppered with typical love story fare, it was also full of marvelous insights.Life marches on and there are opportunities at every turn.
__label__1	Beautiful scenery, but thats about all: Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing.
__label__1	Dismal: I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?
__label__1	Non vero Italia!: This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda.
__label__1	"If you liked this movie, you might have a brain damage: Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
__label__1	Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century?: I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
__label__1	Terrible movie, Great scenery: From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!
__label__2	Great Blu Ray Presentation: Didn't see the BD review on Blu-ray.com so thought I write a quick one. Just watched the BD version this week and actually very happy and impressed by the transfer and DTS audio. Would give the video a 4.5 stars out of 5, and audio 5 out of 5. The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.Perhaps just a slight downside and that is the BD clarity and details do make Diane Lane look a tad older than she needs to be.But, still a great release and worthy purchase.
__label__1	Propoganda: This is another movie in the long line of movies trying to shove homosexuality down our throats. Conveniently they don't mention the premis anywhere, making it look like a normal movie that you might like to rent. If you have any morals at all, don't waste your money on the gay agenda.
__label__1	BORING!!!: I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!
__label__1	Cliche city, what was Diane Lane thinking?: Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times. I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone. I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace. Watch it for that alone.Definitely disappointed with this.
__label__2	Diane Lane shines in this wonderful movie!: Oscar nominee DIANE LANE shines in this wonderful comedy about changing your life for the better after a devastating blow. The film is wonderfully made, very funny, very sexy, and beautiful to look at. The scenery is breathtaking and the acting by DIANE LANE is tremendous. This is a very, VERY highly recommended film and the DVD looks like it has some cool extras as well! 5 stars!
__label__2	Horowitz takes a wrecking ball to the Left: In How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas, Horowitz uses ruthless intellect to demolish the foundations upon which the new Left has tried to rebuild itself following the collapse of communism across the world.After reading this book you have to ask how Bill Clinton and Tony Blair can sleep at night.Used as a campaign blueprint, How to Beat the Democrats offers conservatives the tools to take on the Left in electoral combat which have been sadly lacking over the last decade.
__label__2	Alas, if only the GOP would listen to him.: There is no room for RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) in our fight to win over the general population concerning the merits of conservative principles. Horowitz's book documents the fact that rightward ideas are winning ideas and will resonate with voters across the nation. This is a collection of essays, and, for the most part, they are brilliant. Two chapters, The War Room and How to Beat the Democrats, should be very influential upon politicians and the average reader. He preaches tactics and strategies that conservatives must hear and internalize. Important points are that politics are emotional and they should always be about hope. Republicans would be wise to learn from the words of this master. Ten more Horowitz's and the country would be in a much better place. He speaks his mind in beautiful prose and you'll turn these pages quickly. This is a highly recommended choice, indeed.
__label__1	"Gene: Dated. Doesn't tell ""how to beat the Democrats..."" Old, worn advice. Save your money and buy something else."
__label__1	More of the same: If you feel passionately about politics and whether having a republican in office or a democrat will make one tiny bit of difference, then go ahead and buy the latest addition to this seemingly endless genre.For those of us with kids who fear for the sustainability of our planet, I suggest you look elsewhere for solutions.
__label__1	Beware: Ordered retail, received knock-off: The whole point in ordering a genuine retail packaged Canon battery is to avoid cheap Chinese knockoffs. Unfortunately, I ordered two of this product and received just that. Make sure what you receive is a genuine Canon product in retail packaging with hologram. Even then, it's possible that the packaging + hologram has been spoofed.Needed these batteries for a trip to Africa, leaving tomorrow. Beware seller Savings 365
__label__2	Hard to trust any other battery: I got an off-brand battery as an extra for my SD800 IS and was disapointed with the life. The Canon brand is worth the extra cost.
__label__2	Perfect: I bought this to go with my SD700IS because I wanted to keep it all oem and just as the one that came with the camera I have to admit I have never seen a battery last longer I have had the camera for almost 4 months now and between the 2 batteries I have only charged both 1 time and believe me I use my camera allot!
__label__2	Battery: great for when you need an extra battery. It is a great deal on amazon because the cost would be more at a retail store.
__label__2	New battery in retail package: We wanted a spare camera battery for our Cannon SD870IS. It arrived on-time, and worked as expected. We no longer have to worry about our battery going dead on vacation and missing great pictures, we now have a spare.
__label__2	Very Happy!: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Anyhow, the battery came in original and undamaged Canon packaging (looks just like the images available in product description). I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time. Our camera is fairly new so it was a fair comparison - one battery wasn't all that much older than the other.Email me with questions: mister_mr_d@hotmail.com
__label__2	Canon Battery for Power Shot Camera: I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation.It has excellent reviews but battery life is one area where it's been criticized so I decided to purchase a backup before leaving. I decided against a generic battery after reading that although they're cheaper, they don't hold as good of a charge as a Canon. I purchased one from ANATOLIAN BOOKSTORE, INC. through Amazon because that was the best price I found and I was very pleased that the battery was indeed an authentic Canon and holds the same charge as the one that came with the camera.It was delivered promptly, at a good price and was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again.
__label__2	"The battery that saved the wedding: With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"
__label__2	"Choose Canon brand: I wanted a reliable second battery for my camera to take on an extended overseas vacation. I was concerned about ""OEM"" off-brands (which may be OK, but some reviewers advised caution). I was not disappointed by buying the Canon brand named battery which appears to function exactly as my original battery. The Amazon price was much better than I could find locally, and the delivery time was just a few short days after ordering."
__label__2	"Fine battery: I purchased this as an extra battery for a Canon sd800is. It is the same as the original battery and is Canon ""branded"". A third party battery is available locally at TWICE the price, and the Canon version for almost three times the price. This is a good buy."
__label__1	Canon NB-5L Battery Pack: The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products.
__label__2	Must have...: If you are planing on taking that camera on vacation you need another battery and this thing is cheap enough to make the decision a no brainer!You know it is true! You will get to having SO MUCH FUN and forget that your camera has been working from sun up to sun down and now you have no photos of you and that special someone dancing at the cantina! You have no pictures of the lightshow, fireworks or anything else that happened after 9:34pm. The moment that your camera died!Charge both batteries, keep one in the case and one in the camera. Problem solved!
__label__2	Cannon battery: Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
__label__2	Canon MB-5L Battery Pack: I have a Canon Power Shot SX210IS. I called Canon to make sure this was the correct battery pack for it and they told me it was. I started to order it with Canon but it was much more expensive through them than through Amazon so I ordered it from Amazon instead. It came quickly and works wonderfully. I hadn't realized how much I missed taking digital photos that I could share online with friends and family in other states and areas.
__label__2	Perfect backup battery: Although it doesn't get use unless we're out long enough to need a second battery, this product is working just like the original and seems to be a completely legit cannon production (despite a few other reviews).
__label__1	"Not the original Canon battery: We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said ""new"". When looked closely at the battery, it's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera. I'm not sure if $29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery. We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description, or this is considered a deceiving."
__label__2	Excellent little battery: I purchased this battery as a backup for a vacation. It works perfectly. It is indistinguishable from the battery that came with the camera, lasts just as long (one or two days of frequent use), and charges fairly quickly in the standard charger. For folks going on a trip, I recommend taking two batteries for your camera. Just slip the spare into your pocket (not with your loose change or car keys, though) and pop it in when the camera needs it. Charging took a few hours overnight. For European current, my standard charger (not incl) said it takes the local voltage, so I only needed a plug adapter.
__label__1	"Knock off battery does not work at all: I ordered this battery, thinking that it was a 'real battery'. Did not charge or work at all - says ""Canon Made in China"". If this is not a manufacturer's battery then I paid way too much for it. Oh, since it doesn't work at all I paid way too much for it."
__label__1	You get what you pay for: You get what you pay for. I have used these batteries as back up for the original Canon one. After 10 months with only occasional use, battery won''t take or hold a charge. Do you self a favor, and buy a Canon battery. You'll save money in the long run.
__label__1	"Not working: I just got the ""New"" battery, but it looks like already got opened before.Also, It's not working. It can't charge the battery, the light is not turn on!!!!"
__label__2	Canon NB-5L Battery for Canon camera: I purchased a Canon camera a couple of years ago and a Canon battery came with it. I bought a couple of generic brand batteries to use as backup. After a very short time, the generic brand batteries would only keep a charge for about ten minutes or less. Having learned my lesson, I purchased this additional Canon NB-5L battery for my backup. It holds a long charge and is very reliable. Don't waste your money on generic brands like I did, buy the name brand.
__label__2	Brand Name Battery: A no-brainer! The best battery for your Canon camera. What else would Canon want in their cameras? DUH!
__label__1	Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries.: After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned.
__label__1	i have get my order: I never got the battery and im still waiting on it, I want to know whats going to happen cause im still waiting
__label__1	Damaged: Was starting to swell, which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent
__label__2	Ordered wrong Canon battery: I notified Digi Acc to let them know that I ordered the wrong battery. I have 2 Canon digitals and they use different batteries. I ordered the Canon NB-5L for the Canon SD950 IS and should have ordered the Canon NB-4L for the Canon ELPH100HS.I called Digi Acc and left them a message and never received a response. If someone would respond, I would like to exchange the battery.
__label__1	Amazon mix-up: I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains.
__label__1	Battery does not work with my Canon SD700: There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700. The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose. This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work, and I need to shake the camera, or remove the battery and insert it back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive. Made in China. Does not work. Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery?
__label__1	NO, NO, and NO!: I only made it 15 minutes into this movie before I turned it off. My only question (and this pertains to plot, action sequences, dialogue, etc.) is WHY?
__label__1	THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER! SEEN: I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
__label__1	A Confusing Waste of Plastic: The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining.
__label__1	OMG, a complete waste of time: Having read the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. It came & went big screen in near record time. That should have been warning enough. Unfortunately I rented this piece of **** and even worse, I watched the whole thing. All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited. And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD. I really wanted to give this zero stars, but that was not an option.
__label__1	Why, oh why, oh why!: Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!
__label__1	Avoid at all cost !!: Some movies are bad and worth watching 'cos they're bad, this one however is just a total stinker - no redeeming features whatsover. A total waste of time. Do not buy. Do not watch.
__label__1	"Give me the original: I was surprised and delighted to see this ""remake"". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!"
__label__1	Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.: The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague.
__label__1	Don't expect much: The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!
__label__1	Far Cry From Original: Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.
__label__1	travesty remake on bluray? original not even on anamorphic dvd?: The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release.While the orignal classic rollerball hasn't even gotten an anamorphic dvd release, let alone a blu-ray!
__label__1	Great movie, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old: The setting for this movie is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. The arena they skate in looks like a very cheap prop from American Gladiators. There is VERY LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS and no high tech equipment.15 minuets of the movie is done with a night vision camera, so everything you see is either dark green or picth black.Most of the action happens within the rollerball arena. There are only a few action sceens on the streets of the city.
__label__1	"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,...: ""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes. It was terrible. The camera work was even altered when it came on video. I wouldn't have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn't! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
__label__1	"What went wrong with this film?!: This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
__label__2	NON-STOP ACTION...What's NOT to like about this movie?: I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
__label__1	Horrible stupid movie: Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title.
__label__2	GOOD drama, GREAT action!!!: Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
__label__1	R?: What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!
__label__1	Worst movie in a long time: This movie is pointless and stupid. The acting and camera work sucks. The story is sesame streetish and moronic. Stay very far away from this one.
__label__1	Appalling: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
__label__1	The Worst Movie Ever!: This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!
__label__1	Rollerbomb: Stupid, vapid, anemic remake of the 1975 film. Buy the original instead.This film deserves zero stars.
__label__1	Top Ten Worst Movies I ever Saw: This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown
__label__1	"Pathetic: Rollerball in name only. While the original 1975 production was intelligent Science Fiction mixed with action and a touch of intrigue this sequel is nothing but garbage. To compare the two is like saying the first was a Rembrandt while this is urban scrawled graffiti.A great movie from 1975 dumbed down to suit the ethnically urbanized pseudo gangsters that make up the majority of todays youth sub culture. There's good reason that there are hundreds of this Rollerball movie being sold for a penny on Amazon and Ebay while the 1975 version still demands a fair price.Talk about living in a dystopic future society. With movies coming out that cater only to the sub culture niche of wanna be ""gangsta's"" and their hip hop mentality, it's becoming obvious that we ARE living in a dystopic society. This movie was trash."
__label__1	Spectacularly bad: There is no plot. What in the world did I just watch? Nothing made sense, from beginning to end. I've lost my faith in humanity after watching this...
__label__1	Proof that God does not exist: How could there be a God in a universe where the insidious Rollerball 2002 remake is available on blu-ray, but the original 1975 classic is not?
__label__1	A Total Failure: If you've seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you'll probably want to give this remake a miss. It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive? Save your money and get a copy of the original Rollerball.
__label__1	"Low-rent MTV fare...: This 2002 remake of an old classic ranks among other blockbuster flops like ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Waterworld."" It's the future and huge corporations control most of Earth. The one thing that keeps humanity together is Rollerball, a sport that is a mix of hockey, rollerblading, and pro wrestling. Paul Heyman is the announcer for Rollerball, proving that it is never a good thing to have a commentator with an annoying voice for your sport. Chris Klein is John, a young hot-shot who is learning fast that Rollerball is a tough ""sport."" He soon discovers that the corporations control everything that happens in the game. Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility. Even excellent actor Jean Reno does little in the way of making this movie even remotely interesting. It is a monotonous, unexciting flop, a plaigerized version of the fun James Caan film."
__label__1	Little to say about this embarrassing film...: Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this.
__label__1	BALLISTIC BOMB: This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals.
__label__1	Horible: this movie, other than the scenes that depicted the actual game rollerball, was horifyingly (if thats a word) bad. do not see it! it is a huge waste of your moola.
__label__1	Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do: This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it.
__label__1	The pits: A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous.
__label__1	Waste of celluloid: It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with.
__label__2	The Last Word: Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie. The characters, well acted and their stories get under one's skin. A must see.
__label__2	Not Bad At All.....: This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time. Nothing unusual about the story. Just light, breezy read on a Sunday afternoon.And both lead characters were likeable. Something that's harder and harder to find in the genre, IMHO.
__label__1	uggh!: I ordered this border for my new twins nursery! It is truly a cute colorful boarder. I was so excited to find it a a great price! Now i know why!I had one whole roll on the wall and neither of the other 2 rolls would match up to the one i already had on the wall! The borders were different widths! Which throws off all the lines on the border!I even checked the lot numbers on the packaging and they all matched? I had to get very creative to make it work since I already had a whole roll on the wall! very frustrating!
__label__2	Buying another one!: I bought the original 4 years ago, have loved it, and am buying the remanufactured one for our vacation home. I expect it (after reading all the other reviews) to perform exactly like my original, which is still performing beautifully. Looks great on the kitchen counter, too--very classy.
__label__1	Design confuses some into burning kettle: I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).
__label__2	Just Like New: Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.
__label__2	So far so good: This is our 2nd electric kettle. We had a Breville & it stopped workingafter about 2 years of use. The Cuisinart came looking brand new. So farit has been working just fine & for the price I figured it was worth a shot.We have been happy with it and it gets used at least 2 times a day.
__label__2	Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook: A useful tool: Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this book is quite useful. Field personnel, command staff, and planners - all will find it helpful. I found it to be concise, packable, and physically handy. About the only thing I'd change would be to laminate the pages for weather resistance.R.D. Lopez, Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Specialist, Dept. of Public Health
__label__2	Needed for class: Not too much to say; it is the book I needed for class and I got it at a good price on Amazon.
__label__2	A picture book with great photos and interesting historical: This picture book has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. The pages are spread by the breaks in text that we know from reciting the pledge orally at school. Children are from different races. Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given. Facts about the American flag's changes over the years and facts about the proper way to display a flag, and on what days, are included.A beautiful book with great information that every child should be exposed to.
__label__2	Good pictures: This has god pictures and background info on flag. The pledge is written on the pages as you go through the book.
__label__2	criminally under rated doom metal!: these guys were the cream of the doom metal crop late 80s/early 90s.melodically heavy and great musicanship they are very black sabbath insired and can definetly pick up the pace and move.thi live cd is recorded very well and candlemass was in rare form for these recording.get a piece of history buy this cd.
__label__1	This is awful: I bought this album because it had some songs off of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus on it but it was a complete dissappointment, it has the really horrible singer that sounds nothing like the original singer, and he completely destroys some of my favorite songs with his awful warbling and squalking.
__label__2	Pretty Good: After taking a long break from rapping, LL Cool J seems to hold his own on this one, with pretty good production and talented guests, this one is sure to go platinum. Congratulationz to LL Cool j, I thought you fell off, you proved me wrong!
__label__2	"THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME: Everyone should buy this album.It's the best album he ever recorded.The album is a must have cd for all true LL fans.All the tracks are slamin from start to finish.Like the title say ""Greatest Of All Time""."
__label__2	"ill joint!!!!: When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it....all I can say is that its tight. You gotta check out joints like ""Imagine That"", ""Take It Off"" and ""Fuhgidabowdit"". Other ill joints are ""Farmers"" and ""Hello"" what the heck every song is fresh. This is way better than his previous joint ""Phenomenon"". Get this one, it sure is butta...its great to see the one of tha greatest back in tha game!!!!"
__label__1	"Disappointed: I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like ""see-through"" clear blue plastic. Unfortunately, it looks like its made from some sort of tubberware material.The electronic sounds (2 and not in any sequence),one sounds okay/good, the other sounds like the flushing sound on my daughters potty book. The eyes look like round paper decals and looks...wierd. I'm sure my 6 yr old son would like it, just because its YU-GI-OH, but I'm a fan too and was excited about getting this for him for XMAS......I'm glad I started early, I can return it for something else."
__label__2	awsome new blue-eyes shining dragon figure: this is a large blue eyes shining dragon figure from the Yu-Gi-Oh movie! this is the coolest toy. you can have the blue eyes shining dragon in attack mode or in flight mode. it also shoots a blue missle. it isnt very educational, but it is a lot of fun. it is very durable and well worth the money.
__label__2	"WORTH THE MONEY!!!!: My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh. He can't wait to receive this for Christmas. $30.00 does seem like a lot of money for this, but the plain Yu-Gi-Oh figures are $20.00 a pack. Besides, this is the ""cool dragon"" (as my son calls it) from the movie so it is worth it to see him get so exited when he opens this. Note: I was in a Toys R Us store today and these same dragons were priced on clearance at $14.99."
__label__2	Blue Eyes Shining Dragon: I do own this toy, and is a huge fan of the film, so this toy for me is very nice. It may not be very durable, or does much, or may not look like the reall thing very much, but that is why you can still pretend with it. The toy itself lights up and makes noises. Also, when you press a button on its back, its wings and legs spread out, so like the Duel Disk Launcher, it could hurt a real little kid, but not kids who know what it does. I still have fun with the toy, plus it doubles as a model for those out there who like the model Yu-Gi-Oh! products. Although not one of the greatest toys to role of the line, but still nice to play with.
__label__2	Favorite toy at birthday party: Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is one of my childs favorite toys, it is large and movable with lights and sounds. It also shoots a spear like thing from its mouth. The toy is very durable and not too loud. My son can play with it for hours. It definitely made his birthday special - well worth the money!
__label__1	COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!: I simply cannot believe that I paid $30 bucks for this thing. It does absolutely NOTHING, except make a few electronic noises. I kept poring over the instructions, certain that I'd missed something......but I hadn't!! BORING. I think that even my 7-year-old son, who wanted this thing, was disappointed. And don't even talk about the batteries...to add insult to injury, this thing takes button cells, which aren't cheap. Save your $$ for something better.DYB
__label__1	One of my favorite toys!: This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
__label__1	"So much potential, but one overwhelming problem: On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit ""to make some sound"" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder."
__label__1	This machine makes as much noise as a power tool: All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......
__label__2	This is an answer to the TV Guide issue: I have the Philips HDRW720 and had identical TV Guide issues. I talked to the Philips people and the TV Guide people. It seems that the problem is with the cable companies. My company is Brighthouse (Time Warner) and they had compatability problems with the TV Guide program as recently as September 2005 here in Florida. At time there would be no data or missing data. I tried to record programs but there would be nothing because the cable company was not transmtting the data. It has improved 100% since I bought my recorder, still not perfect but almost there.
__label__1	Engineering gone bad: I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS.It's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. They last about 2 months(or less), after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own. My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it. The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit cannot even be purchased on -line at any web site anymore. This is sad after only a few months on the market. I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer.
__label__1	"A Note about Charles Taze Russell: It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
__label__1	Please review the sited URL.: [...]I would not recommend this book. Russell does make some remarkable findings, however, his theology is corrupt and he is a party to a cult.
__label__2	Foie Gras: As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras. It is not as good as the product we purchased in Paris and brought back with us in January, but it was all I could find that was affordable. Store in Refrigerator and note the long shelf life. Very tasty.
__label__1	I used to eat it till I found out how it was made: diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy.
__label__1	Who eats Fois Gras?: So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding.
__label__2	Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans: This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
__label__2	What a book!!: I am using this textbook in a class and it is a whopper. Wonderful pictures, easy to read, clear colors and understandable. I've been working in prisons for 5 years and this book makes a lot of sense. You ought to read their sections on women in prison and on probation. I loved the parts on geriatric prisoners (old cons) and the death penalty. And it is easy to read. More!
__label__2	Long time quilter: I really liked some of the simple quilts in this book. A change from some of the challenging patterns. Brings you back to your roots. Thimnbleberries has always been one of my favorites.
__label__2	You Don't Need a Math Degree to Understand this: Chaos is such a visually stunning field of study, since you invariably run into those computer generated figures of Julia sets or random fractal landscapes or cloud formations.But can we get a rigorous, first principles explanation that is broadly accessible to undergraduates with good, but not advanced math preparation? Well, you might consider this recent book. The authors have gone to some length to explain events without appealing to more than simple calculus.Nothing flashy. But you can obtain a good understanding of fractal dimensions, self iterating systems (like a Sierpinski gasket) and noise.
__label__2	Very good movie about medical students: Very well taken movie that depicts the sacrifices and passion required for medical profession. Background score goes very well with the movie.
__label__2	"VHS tape of Vital signs: Fun movie, but the tape quality listed as ""NEW"" has faded colors- VHS tapes just don't hold up. Arrived on time and otherwise in excllent condition"
__label__2	89 chevy s10 single cab: i wanted to know if this will fit my 1989 chevy s10 single cab regular bed please let me know as soon as possible so i can place my order
__label__2	God's Dawn for Every Darkness: This is a wonderful, encouraging, faith inspiring book. Well written, concise. Thought provoking, inspirational, devotional. Very good to read on the run or to meditate on. Highly recommended. I have it and am giving it as gifts@
__label__1	Cheap. OK value for $9, but not a cent more.: Poor quality fabric, not soft like flannel should be. But was only $9 and it's for my guest bed, so I guess it's OK.
__label__1	DISAPPOINTED: I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
__label__1	i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!: I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices
__label__1	Disappointed except for price: I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!
__label__1	Elastic is falling out of the fitted sheets.: I bought 3 sheet sets, I have noticed on the two queen size sheets that the stitching that holds the elastic in has come apart in several places and the elastic is now falling out. I have only washed these sets two times. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
__label__1	HOW DISAPPOINTING: That is all I can say - you get what you pay for is clearly underrated - you buy sheets for under 10 dollars - what on earth was I thinking - well, I got paper thin sheets that I hope make it thru the first washing -will use them as emergency sheets for guests that want a place to crash - will provide toilet seat cover-like protection against the mattress and who knows what it will feel like next to the skin!! Warning - Caveat Emptor!
__label__2	Good for the price: I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. These are not the best but they certainly are good enough. They are a bit thin but soft and warm. I do recommend them.
__label__1	"Shrinkage: These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
__label__1	Great Price, But......: I ordered these sheets hoping for that comfy flannel sheet I remembered from the old days. Snuggling under the covers in the Fall and Winter, cosseted by soft sheets. Perhaps, I was too optimistic, given the price.These sheets seem to be fairly good quality, but they don't have that fuzzy softness of flannel. There's really not much nap. They are made of a low thread count sort of jersey fabric. The patterns are good, and they come packaged nicely, but in an era where high thread count sheets are available affordably, these sheets are a disappointment.If you like jersey-type sheets, and you aren't too concerned about the softness right out of the package or the thread count, these could be just right for you. And you can't beat the price.
__label__1	Seamingly poor quality: The pillow case seam tore wide open after initial washing (before I even used the set!). I stitched back up and the rest of the set seems fine. Could just be an anomoly, but beware. But then again, they were only $20.
__label__2	Cozy - great price: Very deep pockets, so fits a bit loosely on a standard twin, but it's soft and cozy. I actually look forward to sleeping with these sheets! Discounted price is GREAT!
__label__1	Wrong sheets: I don't know if I'm the only one that experienced this problem but I ordered the BLUE FLORAL Paisley set and got some ugly checkered blue design. Looks like a little kids room sheet. I emailed Amazon and they resend another sheet set that looks EXACTLY the same as the wrong one I received before! I'm giving the item poor ratings because Amazon gives you something that's not even shown on the screen (nor in any of the other options that are even sold out). I'm not even sure what they're shipping out, but it's not what's described on the page. If you have this problem, please email Amazon, so I'm not the only one with this complaint. Thanks.
__label__1	You get what you pay for, and we didn't pay much :-(: The fit of the fitted sheet is LOUSY - the first night we had it on the mattress, it came off. I guess Amazon sold them cheap to get rid of them.DO NOT BUY THESE!!
__label__1	unusable, avoid it: After 1st wash, even before 1st use. It became unusable: full of tiny cotton balls on the surface; shrank 20% at least; tended break. Note that I did follow the wash direction.Now I have to cut them into pieces and see if they are any good for wiping dirt off my car. It not even worth the return postage.
__label__1	bad: got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money
__label__1	Not really a bargain--terrible sheets: Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white.
__label__1	These sheets will self-destruct...: The hems on the flat sheet became unraveled after the very first wash, not just in a few places, but the full length on both sides! However the fabric is soft to the touch and the price was insanely low, so I gave it a courtesy second star.
__label__1	poor workmanship!: These sheets looked pretty until they fell apart the first time I washed them. How does a sheet fall apart? Well, in this case the raw edges were left exposed in several areas when the hems were put in. The exposed fabric, which is loosely woven to start with, simply unraveled. If you must get these sheets, I suggest you have your sewing machine ready to re-sew all seams and hems before using or washing them.
__label__1	Flannel Sheets -- Not Recommended: Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4.99, I would not recommend these flannel sheets for purchase because of the very poor sewing workmanship. The stitches were very large, and also some of the edges were simply turned over once and sewn with a raw (easy to unravel) edge. The sheet would not hold up well after the first washing. I resewed all the edges of both sheets.
__label__2	"Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap.: The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at ""Dollar General"". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift."
__label__2	My wife loves them!: Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale.
__label__2	One of my all-time favorites: This movie is not for everyone, but I love the absurd humor. Every character in it is irrational in some way. Where films today would probably mock the characters in a mean way, this film has more of a sad and sweet acceptance of their eccentricities. It respects the courage of human beings who have obviously been damaged by the hardships of life but still continue to muddle through. Just like real life.
__label__1	Another Warners Archive Collection Bust: As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection. Here is the statement from this website concerning this title:Important Note: This film has been manufactured from the best-quality video master currently available and has not been remastered or restored specifically for this DVD and Digital Download release. Click here to preview this film's video quality.Had I realized this fact, I would not have purchased this DVD from Amazon.
__label__2	great toy: the toy is pretty awsome. it is a lot of fun and really cool. the only problem is that the batteries die really fast.
__label__1	JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. he wanted it so much we tried returning it twice after the third one didn't work even my six year old said forget it. I wish i could have given it a black hole instead of 1 star. JUNK!!!!!!!!
__label__2	coooooooooooooooooool: this toy looks really cool, but i think they should make it have better graphics and a better screen.
__label__2	Help!In major confusion, WHAT TO BUY???!!!: Please i can't decide. I have NEVER seen, played, or touched an Advanced Pet. At toywiz.com com, they have all the pets you would want. Pet1 ,Pet2 ,progress pet.wHAT TO BUY! I read everything i can to find out. I have $91. I could buy almost all of them. But... which one to buy?! this one sounds okay. I never heard anything about the progress pet. But it sounds so good. So if you are willing to help me, post it on the next review. Then i will decide out of all three, which is the best, and until i find out, i will tell all megaman fans, about the best p.e.t.!!
__label__1	This toy is the WORST!: This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't.
__label__1	"The batteries died after less than one day!: I bought a couple of these for my sons. They love to play with them, but after only a few hours of use, the batteries are dead! This could get really expensive considering the batteries are about $3 each. Also, one thing that gets very irritating is the shaking of the PET that has to be done when you get a ""virus"". Very annoying!"
__label__1	Expensive Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Our 8 year old son ACHED for this toy for his birthday and although we thought it to be expensive junk, we wanted to see him happy. The FIRST one we returned thinking it was broken but soon realized with the SECOND one that we just weren't shaking it hard or long enough. After a week of trying to figure this thing out, the screen has gone fuzzy and even a new battery could not revive it. Even our 8 year old is disgusted and frustrated with the quality of this toy. It is going back tomorrow - at our son's request. If your little boy wants this toy, please show him this review and suggest he pick something else. It's just an expensive disappointment. Please read the review by Diane. She says it so much better than we ever could.
__label__2	bought 2 and am happy: Here's a tip - don't shake it up and down. Turn the unit upside down so that the back of the unit is facing the ceiling and shake it side to side. My older son (7) uses that method and he can get it to recover quickly and find viruses as easy as pie. I actually took this sucker apart - the motion detection unit is actually a small metal marble that rolls over a circuit board contact - be careful taking it apart tho - its would be easy to lose the marble and then it would never work.The battery has also lasted for us 2 weeks under fairly strong use - he's up to level 16. My yonger son (5) also has one and while he's not as enthralled - no problems.
__label__2	The Cool Gizmo: I think the megaman PET is really cool. It is really cool that I can have my very own NetNavi like Lan and Chaud on the Megaman TV show. I get to fight viruses like Lan and enter tournaments once you bet 10 viruses.Then you can battle against rival NetNavis and use battlechips.I also like the fact that you can battle against your friends. The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away. Overall I think the PET is very cool.
__label__1	I hate useless products: You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun.
__label__1	Too complicated: The children were happy to play with it but since the electronics was so poor they were very dissappointed and left it on the table
__label__1	junk junk junk: it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white.also it moves very slow on the screen.that is what little of a screen it has.(...)i say get av gameboygame instead.at least that has decent graphics and isn,t a cheap piece of plastic.overall it is a piece of junk.
__label__2	MY SOON TO BE NEW TOY: I Cant wait till christmas then i will get my advace pet i seen what it could do so i cant wait.hey does it come with a jack in cord so u could like jack in to ur computer and add stuff.If so that joint is cool right protoman (yep)!!! hheehehehe im 14 years old and i approve this toy to be the best.
__label__1	peice of garbage!!: Okay this game was pretty fun when I first bought it but after that it just wasnt fun anymore. the thing has no plot but fight viruses and enter tournaments which are VERY hard. Plus there is quite a bit of shaking for an electronic game.
__label__1	Didn't perform as expected: It doesn't cooperate and isn't very user friendly. It feels like it takes forever of shaking until it finally finds a virus for you to fight. Very annoying...especially when mom is fussing at me to stop shaking it.
__label__2	People...: The Plug-In PET is not coming to America. The season of NT Warrior is already over, Axess is airing now. They would have brought the Plug-In to America before the Adanced PET. It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all...
__label__2	COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS TOY IS THE BOMB!this toy has the looks, graphics,& the talents!!!even though i have not played it,i think this toy is very,very,very,cool!when i get my PET,i will go bananas!3 questions:1.how many battle chips can you use at one time?2.can you jack in to any thing?3.where can you get battle chips?THATS ALL FOLKS!
__label__2	An Easy Way To Play: Hi i got this game by trading my brother for some stuff he wanted and i started playing it and was disipointed cause you have to shake it so much. But luckily i figured out how you can get in battles and stuff without having to shake it at all. But it depends on if you you have a massage chair or not because if you have one you can set your magaman pet on it and it shakes it!!! I was so glad when i figured out how to get in battles without shaking it because my arm was hurting now i find the game real fun. I hope this review helped you see yah.
__label__2	So human, so hot: Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more, the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain, their joy, their search, their honesty, the lies, the hopes, the hot , out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears, and compassion, and much, much more. Hot, hot, hot.
__label__2	Very sexy: I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him.

As opposed to the crude ""deathcrushing"" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of ""De Mysteriis,"" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before. Usually very fast, sometimes atmospheric (all done w/out synths, except for the ambient intro track), and always hellish - every aspect of this music is absolutely insane, and it definitely gives hope for a grim future."
__label__2	"Savage and brutal: This is a great, great cd. As the first Mayhem release with the current lineup, they came right out of the box with a masterpiece of unanticipated power. Each track is just monstrous in every way; and the production is some of the very best you'll likely ever hear on a black metal release. Note that this contains the first part of their epic full- length release ""Grand Declaration Of War"", so be sure to buy both. You won't be disappointed if raw, seriously dangerous metal is what you're looking for."
__label__2	The cliches were invented right here: There are Hammett fans and Chandler fans. I am for Hammett, but Chandler's work remains compelling. The plots are nonsense but the metaphors are the purest gold. The opening scenes of THE BIG SLEEP and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY are delicious every time.
__label__2	Great Stuff: Second only to Dashiell Hammett, the works of Raymond Chandler are the best in American crime fiction. Great style with words, intrieging plots, fascinating characters, I enjoy everthing he has written. The Big Sleep is also a wonderful movie with Bogie playing the lead and Bacall the vamp.
__label__2	Pour the scotch and smoke 'em if you've got 'em: What I consider one of the greatest descriptive writers in the Western cannon, Chandler can transport you in to old Los Angeles. Every story will make you crave a stiff drink and perhaps even leaving a smell of tabacoo in your clothes. I recomend these stories to people who want to understand LA better because Chandler caught the essence of the city that can even be seen today. Look down the 2nd street tunnel at 2 am and see that barrel of a gun or drive to the Rosebowl and see why he makes reference that there are no sidewalks in that wealthy neighborhood. If you want to learn about noir, there is a reason Chandler is considered one of the fathers.
__label__2	"Chandler joins the ranks of America's elite authors: The addition of this title and its companion volume, ""Later Novels & Other Writings,"" to the venerable Library of America series makes official what mystery fans have always known: Raymond Chandler is one of the gods of American literature. Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for ""Double Indemnity,"" and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life. In terms of literary inventions, the Wild West cowboy and the hard-boiled PI are this country's only true native sons, and, as such, are deserving of resepct. One of them at least now has it.--Michael Roger"
__label__1	"Pathetic: I bought this album because I heard a killer version of ""White Christmas"" on a station on Live365. The link pointed me to this album. What a dissapointment! The tracks are half-baked, synth-drenched remakes with none of the swing of the song I heard. Liner notes are non-existant, leading me to wonder if any of the original Drifters even had a hand in this project. Don't waste your money! I did manage to locate the version I heard on Rhapsody on an album called ""Soul Christmas"" on Atlantic Records."
__label__2	great!: got this one for my girlfriend, she really likes it a lot so im happy, sometimes sounds a lot like king diamond haha but what can i say it sounds good!
__label__1	Not appropriate for 9 yr olds: My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
__label__1	wrong trikke in box: I purchased this Trikke thinking that it would be a great surprise for my son on his birthday. When I received the Trikke it was missing two pieces. This Trikke came in a box that didnt match the product. It does not fold down at all which makes it hard to pack for trips etc... I am very dissappointed in this product and Razor company should get a great big slap for false advertising. The advertisment also does not state the weight capacity, its say both kids and adults can enjoy this product. The weight capacity is only 175lbs. It does not come with an owners manual, and there is no tool case. The allen wrenches come in a plastic baggie taped with scotch tape. Very Very disappointed.
__label__1	not as advertised: the item description says this is aluminum, but when i received the item, the box says 'solid steel'. very dissappointing! i live by the beach and steel doesn't last long. it was for my son's birthday, now i have to send it back and he won't have his main present!
__label__1	Not what we thought: From pictures, etc., we thought this trike somehow had a means of locomotion - swaying back and forth? My determined child never figured it out, and instructions never hinted to a technique. So, it ends up being a scooter that is not very functional because it's hard to balance on one side and scoot with the other foot.
__label__2	"Classic Soundtracks at their Best!: This disc is simply gorgeous! I love classic movie scores, and this is one of my favorite collections. The ""Gunga Din"" and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" themes are so well done you can imagine each scene from the movie as it is played. These are my two favorite scores in the collection because the various themes are each given their own track. (And I already had the other scores on another compilation!) It really is a must for classic movie lovers!!!!!"
__label__2	One of my favorites...: Mr. Pratchett is a very good writer, and while not every discworld novel is a knock out, none have been bad. Of all of his work this is my favorite. I reread it at least every couple of months. Bruthra and Om [pointy horns] spin a tale quite entertaining that keeps me coming back. I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do.
__label__2	"Not at all what you'd expect from fantasy, but...: still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a ""British"" or an ""American"" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."
__label__2	The turtle moves!: My sister read this book aloud to me on a road trip from Seattle to California. It is a work of multilayered artistry to be appreciated from the spiritual to the fantastic. It's also fun and unlike most of Pratchett's books you actually care about most of the characters. Reads well out loud as well. Like many readers here, I see it as the author's pinnacle, the book that he will be remembered for. Here's to immortality, Mr. Pratchett!
__label__2	Good fun, as usual: A really fun book, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. None of our old pals [Rincewind, Gaspode, Vimes, Susan] put in an appearence [other than the guy WHO TALKS LIKE THIS and an old monk with a broom, and they but briefly], but it does add some info to the overall Discworld mythology, and provides some laughs as well.
__label__2	Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or ....: I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read.
__label__1	"Not Prachett's best by a long shot.: Terry Pratchett's other books are a lot like well painted homes. There are several layers. ""Small Gods"" is like inviting over your friends to paint. There is one uneven coat of paint and they left masking tape on all of the edging in an unsuccessful attempt to miss it with their paintbrushes. The ending of the book (and middle and beginning too if truth be known) left me with the same vague feeling of dissatisfaction as when I realized that to get the place properly painted I would have to have another seperate group of friends and throw another 'paint party'."
__label__2	MIGHTY ENDING: I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun.
__label__2	Great: Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny. I particulary liked the philosophers. But the greatest character had to be Om.
__label__2	To not read this is a sin. Toni VII, verse 4: Whoever read the first page of the book and like the stile of the exposition there must buy the book.There is nothing greater under the sun and on the Disk as well then that. (I can fill that my Gods are suffering because, I'm begining to belive in the book instead of them) But what can I do - it's stronger then me.What can I say (take a look on my e-mail address) It says it all.
__label__2	"The most hilarious in-depth look at religion around!: Like all other Pratchett novels, this one is extremely witty, sarcastic, and equally intelligent. Let's start a new religion- we'll call it ""Pratchettism"""
__label__2	"An interesting book: This is the thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld--a flat world, supported on the back of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle, anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.Brutha is a novice in the temple of Om, and he thought that things were very settled. And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (""Psst!"") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"
__label__2	I'm a Terry Pratchett's fan: Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it. Makes you think about faith while it makes you laugh about everything. If I had not read better Pratchett's books, I would have rated this with a five
__label__2	Now consider the tortoise and the eagle.....: This was one of the best books in the discworld series i ever read. The Great God Om, wanting to stir up the belief of his followers, decides to manifest himself. He has taken the form of very majestic creatures in the past but for some reason that even he cannot understand he has now manifested himself as a two pound tortise and cannot even do proper miricles anymore. Finding himself with only one true believer (the others trusting in the Quisition)he must try to find a way, using this beliver as his prophet, to regain proper godship. This will be no easy task because the only person that believes in him is not even a preist and tends a small vegetable garden...
__label__2	A Philosophy Book Encapsulated in Discworld: I've been reading the Discworld books in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!
__label__2	Hilarious: The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing.
__label__2	A must-read for whoever enjoys zany stories and good laughs!: Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods. Brutha, a lowly, simple-minded novitiate of a mighty religious empire, has just met his god face-to-face. Actually, heel-to-face, because the mighty god Om is really a not-so-mighty tortoise who is out to reclaim his empire -- with Brutha's help
__label__2	A+: the book came really fast and was in great condition, I cant wait to read it i would order from them again for sure.
__label__1	Missing pages in ebook: I'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he's created and the incredibly intelligent books. While I greatly enjoy the book itself, I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone. Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return. Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal. There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version.
__label__2	Chelonian Theology: Nobody can discuss serious philosophical issues in hysterically funny ways like Terry Pratchett. Small gods is as intelligent exploration of theology and people's relationship to religion as you'll find but if that's not what you want to take from it you'll have a great time laughing through the book. The Turtle Moves.
__label__2	moking religeon! , I like it.: this book should be worshiped as the bilble so that I dont have to go to church. the reason this book was so funny is becouse jokes are funnier writen down.
__label__1	Finally, a let down: I have read most of this series with great delight. However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel.
__label__1	"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation: While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."
__label__1	simply not that funny: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)
__label__1	a disgrace to religion: although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett.
__label__1	Zzzz...: In my opinion, the worst book in the series. I read this book through just because I did not want to waste my spent money.do only buy it if you are a HARDCORE Discworld Fan.
__label__2	Helpful: I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.
__label__2	Grandma loves it: We have some native roots and my grandmother found this book fascinating. I bought her several Iroquois books from Amazon as a Christmas gift and she loved them all. She keeps calling me to tell me about them.
__label__2	Shakespeare criticism - a historical survey and sampler: Halliday's excellent introduction makes a historical survey of Shakespeare criticism . Halliday claims that new perceptions of Shakespeare were developed at fifty year intervals starting with his his contemporaries, then with Dryden in the Restoration, Pope in the Augustan Age, Johnson in the Age of Reason, and Coleridge in the Romantic Age. One of the surprising revelations is that it is only with Coleridge that Shakespeare is written and thought about primarily as a poet. It is Coleridge who too lays waste the conception that Shakespeare was a wild , careless genius with little concern for the artistic construction of his work.The second part of the work contains brief selections of criticisms about the individual plays.I found this work provides a sense of the overall development of Shakespeare criticism from its inception to the mid- twentieth century.A valuable work.
__label__1	The worst mess ever: DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!
__label__1	"Awful, at best: Wow, this is one of the most useless ""books"" I have ever read. Based on the title, one would expect some sort of insight into a career search. I found this book to be no help at all. It looks like the author lifted a few job ideas from the government job handbook and wrote a bad Clif's Notes for them. If you want guidance, please do not waste your time and money on this drivel. I agree with the previous reviewer.... I feel sorry for anyone that actually paid for this book."
__label__1	Spend your money better: This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.

__label__2	This movie is Funny: I really liked the part when John Candy was at the firing range. This movie is one of Candy's greatest.
__label__1	AWFUL!: A really horrible movie! Not funny. Poorly made. Much of it was incomprehensible. Production quality was poor. Video manufacturing quality is poor. AVOID THIS CLUNKER!!!

__label__1	Fanatical: My nutritionist (who is a celiac) asked me to burn this book! The advice is fanatical. Throw away your non-stick cookware, plastic containers and wooden spoons because they are contaminated. Pleassse!
__label__1	The Gluten-Free Bible: There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer.
__label__1	Great attitude, if only the info was great...: Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free.
__label__1	Do not hear, do not obey...: If you have a mild to moderate gluten intolerance, you can MAYBE follow this book's advice and be safe. If you have full on Celiac Disease, you will find yourself sick in a single digestive cycle!Jax's information is lacking, out of date, and incorrect. I obsessively research foods, medicines, ingredients, and restraunts so as to be able to join my friends and family in their dinners, and my research shows Jax to be woefully incorrect. I'm encouraging my local booksellers to not carry this any more, and I encourage the discerning readers amoung you to take great care. If you want the feel good stories, read the feel good stores. Don't take the feel bad advice.
__label__1	"Irresponsible!: What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"
__label__1	Socialite celiac: Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out. It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children. She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated.I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life.
__label__1	Poor Information for Celiacs: I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
__label__1	new celiacs need to read with caution: While there is much good information and insightful stories in this book, there is also some information that is just inaccurate and/or very disputed within the celiac community. If you are a newly diagnosed celiac, please read this book with caution and refer to other sources. Danna Korn's books (Wheat-free, Worry-free and Kids with Celiac) are very factual and well researched. Tania Pineo
__label__2	A must read for barn lovers....: I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book.
__label__2	"cuts to the heart: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, ""Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)"" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an ""easy"" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as ""electric""--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten."
__label__2	magic under a microscope: After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing.

__label__1	On second thought: I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine.
__label__2	David: In this unique conbination of biography, commentary, & devotional, Arthur Pink offers an intimate view of the many sides of David. The shepherd, the soldier, the king and the sinner are revealed in a way that cuts to the heart of life's greatest problems.

What the heck ? I bought the book for a gift ( one the best book on the planet by the way ) the book is an heirloom, I was very disappointed , the delivery time was good, but the condition of the book is just crap. For me there is no way to correct this at this point, I needed it by this coming Friday... absolute disappointment !Dan Hall
__label__2	"Stunning!: Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their ""rehearsals"" at the Cultural Center in Rio. Beautifully filmed and edited (except for some frontal shots of Zelia where the camera seems to shake), this DVD was recorded one years after the CD of the same name. It's fascinating to hear how the songs evolved after a year of working together. So many highlights, I can't even begin...but will simply mention that Zelia is in top form and wearing a beautiful dress!Just check it out--you'll be glad you did! Maravilhosa!!!Beleza, Zelia!!!!!"
__label__2	Zelia Duncan: This is an excellent DVD. The music is fantastic, the singer is great and the musicians are the best. I highly recommend it!
__label__1	Where's the instructions: Was a little tricky without instructions but I figured it out....however, will not work on the bike as the brackets are too thick to slide over the wheel bolts and leave enough room for the frame to be reattached. Returning it
__label__2	Bike Basket: Good quality overall. The braket for the stem didn't fit my application, so I improvised, and mounted it behind the seat over the rear fender and low. Holds stuff.
__label__2	Behind the Eyes: A darker side of Amy. Probably written and recorded when her marriage was falling apart. Very insiteful.
__label__2	Behind the Eyes Amy Grant: Hello, this CD has some good songs on it too. I like she sounds on this one. It has some happy songs on it.
__label__2	One of Amy's best pop albums...: This is a sad and thoughtful album, indeed, and Amy writes one of the saddest songs on this album (Missing you). Many of the songs are about unrequited love, marriage, and hardships in life. This album def. reflects Amy's feelings on her marriage to Gary Chapman, and her love for Vince Gill. It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer. Buy it if you like Amy's previous pop albums, or if you like sad songs (Which I do!)Choice tracks:Nobody homeCry a river,Leave it all behind,Missing you,The feeling that I had,Somewhere down the road.
__label__2	"Refreshing new material by Amy Grant: Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy's two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. ""Turn This World Around"" is my favorite on the CD, but the rest of the material is also great."
__label__2	Odd that this is my favorite...so you know it has to be good: I'll keep it short since I want to go eat my lunch. Out of the hundreds (at least) of CDs I've listened to, this is my favorite of ALL TIME. Which is weird, because I don't have any other Amy Grant albums, and I'm actually not interested in any other albums by her. So you know there has to be something great about it. I heard this album, and promptly went out to buy it. I went on a cross-country train trip by myself last summer, and this CD was a great one to have while I looked out at America flying past my window and thought about life. I don't mean to sound dramatic or over-the-top, but this CD affects me in a way that VERY few other albums do. It trancends the normal music world.
__label__2	"Great CD!: I think that this is a great album. My personal favorite song on it is ""Like I Love You."" Probably the most popular song on it is ""Takes a little time."" My friend is crazy about that song! You should buy this CD!"
__label__1	"Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant: All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
__label__1	"Depressing!: I own all of Amy Grant's other CD's and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. I find it amusing that she puts out one of her worst albums ever and her ex-husband (Gary Chapman) puts out one of his best. It seems like she is trying to break out of the ""Gospel & Pop"" mold that made her. I bet she does country (with Vince Gill) next."
__label__1	NOT GOOD: Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing? First she gets everyone thinking she's a Christian singer so she doesn't get as much opposition and more positive attention. Then she gets secular and fools those who are too blind to see. If you think ANY of her music will draw you closer to God it won't, and NO MATTER WHAT don't get this CD!
__label__1	Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video: If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Granted, the original, out-of-print dvd of The Bikini Carwash Company sells for exorbitant prices, so my suggestion is to just download it for free through torrents and cut the video pirates and video scalpers down to size. If anything, buy the European PAL version, which is also uncut and uncensored, and available on the North American Amazon as well.
__label__2	Godd film for when you're in the mood for hotties!: No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex! One hillarious film.
__label__1	"don't even bother: this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
__label__1	Not worth all that money: The content does not simulate the actual USMLE and there are so many nagatively phrased questions and also, most of the questions are never asked as for as my step1 experience goes.
__label__1	Don't waste your money on this: The most unpractical cd i have ever used.A complete waste of money nothing but absurd questions on anatomy and phsiology in step 2
__label__1	Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2: I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 ).
__label__1	Don't waste your time or money: This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. I don't know who wrote the questions on this program, but they clearly were not familiar with usmle format or usmle content. In agreement with the other reviews, the questions were totally random and kind of off the wall. If they have the audacity to charge 59.00, they should at least live up to the price tag. You are better off using the practice CD that USMLE gives you for free.
__label__2	best book I've read in past 5 years: scholarly, well-researched, often humorous look at development of human notions of what is sacred and how it became so.
__label__2	good value: if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. this one fit the bill and fits [tightly] in my stabilla 8' case with a level.
__label__2	"DELL E207WFP 20.1"" Digital/Analog TFT Flat Panel Monitor: Just a grea product from Dell! I never regret purchasing this lcd monitor though my 17 inch CRT which this replaced was truly sharp. This lcd is totally comparable in sharpness which is a plus when editing your digital pictures. It being flat makes you take back very much needed space, of course. If you only have analog connector on your pc you will still find this lcd okay. I installed a pc card with digital connector on my pc thus allowing its signal to stay digital (versus the pc converting its signal to analog so you could use your crt monitor which is of course analog). With this size, I tend to watch my dvds here than on my 50 inch Regza flat TV."
__label__2	Dell E207WFP Monitor: This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well.
__label__2	"The King sits on his 70's Throne and I LOVE IT!!!: I've always LOVED this LP and it is one of my All Time Favorites! Lots of Great Soul Music: In The Name, Green Power (MUST HEAR), Dancing In The Street. Some Solid Rockers: Title Track, Midnight Special. Plus a couple of Richard's Over The Top Monologues: Joy To The World (++MUST HEAR++)and Born On a Bayou. In addition, ther is a couple nifty covers: The Way You Do The Things You Do, Brown Sugar, and the magnificent - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry -. I just think this album is FUN. ""King Of Rock and Roll"" gets alot of medicore/negative reviews and I think folks just miss the boat... Would I start my LR Collection here? No. Is it over-produced? Yes. Does it at time sound ""cartoony""? Yes, but if you dig the wild/crazy Little Richard of the 70's - you will eat this album up!!!"
__label__1	What's on it: Who would buy it not knowing what is on it, is there any new material, is there a better version of music than previously released, how many, etc., etc. You've got to tell us something - give us a reason to buy it - give us a few short pieces to listen too! King indeed; he's pretty good but the King has been dead awhile (notwithstanding the occasional phantom sighting) and the remaining living creators of original rock and roll - Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry are very much alive and touring and in Jerry Lee's case still recording great music.I'll take a look at buying this if I can see and hear what it is!Jimp.s. sorry for the 1 star but ...
__label__1	Hard Times: I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor.
__label__1	A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words: This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two.
__label__1	Death by verbosity: Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point
__label__1	"Soot-covered Sentimentality: Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
__label__2	Dark and rich: Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!
__label__2	not his best, but pretty good: It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world.
__label__2	"The complexity of Dickens: ""Death by verbosity"" describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of ""Great Expectations"". Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."
__label__1	Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written: This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read.
__label__2	Great Nariation but not that good of a book.: This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature.
__label__1	"Underwhelmed: This is not Dickens at his best. No offence to the narrator, who does a good job but I think the story itself is rather boring. Especially when compared with his classics ""Great Expectations"", ""A Christms Carol"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities""."
__label__2	"A good, clean book: For my English class, I read Charles Dickens' ""Hard Times."" I chose this book because I have read several of Dickens' works, and I have enjoyed them. I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."
__label__1	Zzzzzzz: I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?
__label__2	Hard Times...: I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon.
__label__2	Beautiful blouse!: I love this blouse! It's nicely cut and quality material. Unfortunately for me I ordered the wrong size and mine isn't available so I have to return it. I'm usually very disappointed in quality when I order clothing online, but risked it and took another chance. I was happily pleased! Plus this is made in the USA, which is very hard to find. I received a little National catalog with the blouse, that I plan to use. Just sad I can't keep this beautiful red blouse...
__label__1	"Worst. Movie. Ever.: This is the worst movie ever made. A bold statement, I know, but true nonetheless. It is 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back. The only reason I kept watching is because I told myself: ""Self, there is no way a movie could be this bad. I am sure that they will wrap it all up at the end."" WRONG. The story tried to be some sort of moralistic tale about the dangers of being self involved, but in reality it is a warning of the dangers of hiring a bad director. Please do not watch. And if you do - for the love of all that is quality movie making - DO NOT PAY THE $22 that amazon is charging.Note: The first scene involves a man ripping open his back to pull out an organ. I found this scene ironic because later in the movie I was considering ripping out my own eyeballs."
__label__2	Better then the last.: It had more challenges and characters then the 1st Maximum Impact. The original Japanese language makes it better for the fans of the series.
__label__1	more of the same: It's *another* King of Fighters game. Don't we already have enough of these already? It's not like this one is drastically different from the other ones.It's basically the same game as all the other King of Fighters but with a 2006 date attached to the title name, which means people will notice it, realize it's brand new, and buy it immediately. Why do we continue to be tormented like this? In a world already loaded with more than enough tournament fighters, I have just this to say- FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
__label__2	Great!: This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!
__label__2	Nice Album from West Coast!: Good Production,With tons of most loved West Coast Gangsta Rapper support,Snoop Dogg, DPG, RBX, Ras Kass, Kokane, Suga Free Ice Cube....etcStrong West Coast Line up!!!All songs is very good!One of the album that you should purchase for you west coast collections!
__label__2	Alittle More Of This and Alittle less of That: Bad Azz is dope and getting better everytime i hear him, however in my opinion its his beats and track selection that will halt his progress in terms of album sales and flava. His first album was good but suffered the same as this album in the fact that there are too many tracks that sound the same because they are so laid back and really lacking alittle liveness or crunkness even though this maybe the style of beat Bad Azz chose because he describes ghetto struggle so well. The best tracks are 'Streetz Illustrated', 'Wrong Idea' and 'How We Do It' with afew others close behind. If Bad Azz can include afew more tracks like these on his albums then he will start to really shine. Buy this album still, because the good tracks are Phat!!!
__label__2	Real Tight: A real tight C.D. In my opinion two times better than his original with better production and better lyrics. A couple of tracks were sleepers but without a doubt worth picking up when you see it.
__label__1	"I dont feel it: Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
__label__1	Down right aweful: I picked this up second hand a couple of weeks ago and I would have been happier to leave it behind. This sounds like a album that producers decided to off load there average beats to, to cash in on some extra doe. Now I dont look at raps as being the issue on rap albums as the raps should only be taken in as an over throw to the beats. The west coast is all about the groove of the music and the rappers slicking there rhymes over the top in mesmeration to these beats. How any of the rappers that feature on this album does this beats me or are they like the producers just cashing in. The good tracks as few as they are on this arnt even that worth repetitive listens. Sorry Bad Azz but if your style incourages beats like this then your crossed off my list.
__label__1	Save your money: This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]
__label__2	The Safe Place: This story broke my heart. I could not put this book down until I read the whole story. I am amazed at what this child had to go through before someone recognized that she was dyslexic and needed help in order to learn to read. It made me wish that every child had a place they could go where they felt safe and cared about, where no one would make fun of them because they could not read or write or do math, skills that most children take for granted. It made me realize that schools should provide every child a place to go where they felt safe and cared about, a place such as the resource room and teacher as described in this story. It also made me realize how important it is that teachers learn to recognize signs of dyslexia in children in their classrooms and bring it to the attention of appropriate school personnel. This is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend for teachers, parents, and educational/school psychologists to read.
__label__2	A delighted Teen: Hey,Jake here. I've watch all the Megaman series from the time I was 6. When the new Megaman NT Worrior series came out I had to watch at least one episode. After that I was hooked. Ever since then I've been waiting for a PET to come out. This toy is the coolest. It lookes exactly like the ones on the show. The battle chips are great too. The only thing I can say is bad is that it olny comes with three chips and as of now there is no way of getting any, unless u buy a figure (...), you can get 1 battle chip per figure. Other than that this is one of the best toys I've seen in a while.
__label__2	Possibilities in the Future: Although the PET's are an interesting concept, perhaps you (the customer) should wait until something more hi-tech such as one with a laser pointer acsess and the Net Nabby actually communicates with you. There would also de much better graphics. This computing power isn't feesable now, but if you wait it'll be worth it.
__label__1	"are you kidding me?: I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
__label__2	Megaman PET: This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i'm 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with
__label__2	cool!!!!!!!!: the pet is preety cool its a nice sise and also if u want great game exp. buy more battlechips i cant give this toy 5 stars becuse when u die u need to shake it which is retadrded when i bought it at first i thought it would be a load of crap now i know that and if u buy it i want u to know
__label__1	don't buy: I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?
__label__1	useless: [...]i said that it was good and fun but i was all wrong. the day i got it after playing with it by myself, it fell then the pet had a scratches and paint bruises (that white mark). the third day i got bored of the same three chips so i brought more, it was expensive and the chips are small. so my little sister already lost half of them (and the chips are easy to spot). the first two weeks it ran out of power, and it has their own special battery,so it was gone (also i forgot to say is the, gameplay of it was bad,and it was imposible to beat somebody with a higher level and better chips unlike yugioh). For kids (like me) don't ask to buy it ,it was hard to find some body with the pet. for parents make sure there is a x on this thing on your child's list,it won't last long (more likely for younger kids). overall to everyone should get the nintendo ds,GBA or atleat the video now thing, this pet is a waste.
__label__2	"Cool, man!: My friend had a PET except it was blue. It is unbelievable!!! The only bad thing about it is that u have to shake it 15 minutes to even fight a virus! I want red which is the ""#2"" PET. U should get it. My friend said that he made up a chip called the ""sinqule chip."" He made this ""dementional area"" to do this special power. It's called ""down fusion."" He says that it wastes all off your energy, but in one shot... it defeats the guy your versing! He says only one guy has it. HIM!!!!!! I think he's lieing. But remember... get it!"
__label__2	A tight, interesting thriller.: Timothy Hutton plays a Science Fiction author who, although he has written many novels, is best known for his first book about a song that haunted him. The song returns with a vengeance in the film and it is up to him to find a way to stop it from killing others. This was a nice tight thriller with fine acting by Hutton and David Kelly who may be familiar from Charlie and the Chocolate factory or Waking Ned Devine. It kept me guessing until the end (which is fairly hard to do). The background of beautiful Mediterranian locations make this a great movie to help escape from the summer heat.
__label__1	Hutton's lost cause: Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film.He plays Science Fiction Author David Norton. He is invited to an island conference. He takes his girl friend, asks her to marry himA DVD appears in his room and she commits suicide..and then more people start dying. He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag. There is no sub plots. The suspense of this film feels disjointed and starts to bore. There are no thrills to capture an audience. Towards the end, Hutton looks bored as lead and the film falls apartTry to miss this one in your video store, until all the other good films are rentedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
__label__2	Outstanding movie!: This is an excellent film, with more twists and turns in the plot than a snake in a pretzel factory. Highly recommended!
__label__1	I expected more.....: The 2 stars goes to Timothy Hutton for his great performance, truly an outstanding actor! But... the movie... well not so great. I was left somewhat disappointed. It starts well and gives you the impression of a good movie but then it evolves into a bizarre scenario that completely fails to keep up the suspenseful tone of the start, and is in fact rather wearisome and inconclusive at times. It's as if they are trying really hard to achieve a goal with a poor script... I expected more that's all...
__label__1	WHAT A WASTE!! DON'T BUY!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!: THIS WASTE OF TIME COST ME TWENTY BUCKS FOR A VIDEO THAT WAS NOT EVEN THIRTY MINUTES!! YOU CAN NOT EXPLORE ANYTHING IN THAT SHORT OF TIME!!!! YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON YOUTUBE FOR FREE!!! DON'T FALL FOR THE SAME TRICK I DID! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
__label__2	Egyptian technique: This is a wonderful video. Teachings egyptian technique and combos- I love it. It has helped me become a better dancer.
__label__1	difficult to program, no access to manual: Sp65 is difficult to program. Detailed instructions are not included with purchased item, and send you to a web page that is unavailable (www.sonicblue.com/support). I think this is a piece of junk!
__label__2	The sinking of the Carl D. Bradley (SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN: I notice the other reviews of this double book ( two books under one title) concern the FIRE AT PESHTIGO. Just is important is the SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN portion. Essentialy this is one of the better accounts of the sinking of the Carl D. Bradley limestone carrier in Northern Lake Michigan November 18, 1958.Author Davenport picks up the story and moves towards the climax from different angles. One aboard a nearby salty freighter, another on board the soon to be doomed ship and still another in the home port of Rogers City Michigan.As a reader of Great Lakes History this accoount is one of the very best. It may be hard to find a copy as it had been over 25 years since it was in print.
__label__2	In Nomine Patris et Filii: I love everything on this album. Every song is perfect, the guitars are raw like a rusty chainsaw, and Vikernes sings like he was about to kill someone the second after. Standout tracks: the first song and the 25 mins atmospheric one.If you're a catholic or a believer this is a must.5/5
__label__1	I just dont understand: Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Dont get me wrong, I like black metal, and not just the symphonic stuff like Dimmu Borgir and later Emporer. This album i akin to someone pissing in my ear. There is almost no quality in the musicianship. Repetitive and just plain boring. If you want to hear REAL old-school but also excellent BM go and get Satyricon's The ShadowThrone and anything by Mayhem. Dont waste your time with this drivel. im not a kid either but beleive what you will.
__label__1	Count Grishnak pales in comparison to Euronymous: Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem. The music is not too bad, but Grishnak deserves no attention for his deeds.
__label__2	Colorful Overview of the Islands: What a pleasure to read such a high-quality book... It introduces each of the islands in a colorful and vivid way. The book includes many pictures, and provides a fine insight into the culture and character of the islands and touches on history, people, travel, activities, sights, nature, and a lot more.However, if you are looking for a book with accurate travel information, e.g. hotels, restaurants, prices/dates, how to get there, etc., this book is on the weaker side. Use it together with the Frommer's Caribbean guide for a combination that is hard to beat. Despite this weakness, it's still a five star on my bookshelf.
__label__2	An Unfound Gem: This band has a straight forward approach to music that is sturdy, simple, aggressive and a little annoying, in a good way. The often frenetic lead guitar is right up front to create a classic rustic American sound. This band must like Blind Willie McTell as they cover Dying Crapshooters Blues and mention Mctell in their original track Down at Danny's. If you are looking for something different with a classic American roots music sound - this is a nice find.
__label__1	DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS BRA!: This bra is completley worthless! It offers absolutely no support, is cheaply made and does not run according to size. Don't waste a penny on this. You will be disappointed.
__label__1	ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!: i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
__label__1	Nice bra, but sizes run LARGE: I love the style of the bra, however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size. The label read 46D (which I know I wear), but had to send it back because the cup was just too LARGE.
__label__1	"March of the Saint is the one to find...: I remember Armored Saint from their tour opening for WASP and Metallica. L'Amour in Brooklyn. These guys ROCKED. Unfortunately this album, lacking second guitarist Phil Sandoval, does not rock. Poor production values, even explained on the liner, makes it even less acceptable. I gave it the second star only because it was great to hear ""Can U Deliver?"" again and I can't find the now out of print ""March of the Saint"" first album. Buy it if you're a die-hard Saint fan like myself, but if you're looking for a good Saint album currently available get ""Symbol Of Salvation"" instead. It's pretty rockin'."
__label__2	"amazing: ""Motor City Moments"" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, ""Don't Git Sassy"" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune ""For Somoeone I Love,"" where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like ""The Love Theme from Spartacus."" Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone."
__label__2	Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream.: I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again.
__label__2	Great CD: Love Regina's work, love Jazz. I am a violinist and love hearing the violin played in different genre's love what she does
__label__1	"violin w/a kick: Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry ""Forever February"" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Don't Mess With Mr. T"" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances."
__label__2	"TRUE WORSHIP: Nomatter what I am going through, Darien and LW's music is always able to bring my back into focus. If you are looking for a true worship album, this is the ONE!! There are lots of ""worshippers"" and commercialized gospel singers out there doing the best they can, but you can tell when the focus goes away from the Lord. Darien's writing stays true to the reason we sing, and that is the Almighty King. You will fall down on your knees. You will dance and shout in praise! BUY THIS ALBUM - IT WILL BE THE BEST SPIRITUAL INVESTMENT YOU EVER MAKE (AFTER ACCEPTING CHRIST)!"
__label__2	FRUSTRATING OMMISIONS: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VIDEO COMPILATION AS PERFECT DUE TO A NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE OMMISIONS. ALONG WITH IGNORING THE TELEVISION PERFORMANCES FOR 'STARMAN' AND 'REBEL REBEL', THERE ARE NO VIDEOS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1973 AND 1977, A TIME IN WHICH BOWIE HAD MANY FANTASTIC SINGLES INCLUDING 'FAME', TVC15', 'GOLDEN YEARS' AND 'SOUND AND VISION'.

__label__2	a new king: Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died. The grand father skipped over his son (a fat gross slob) to give Steve the medallion and the ring of kingship. This set off a war.Gypsies are mostly known for their grift, scams and cons but when called upon they can fight and kill too. Several attempts are made on his life but he survives. Read this book and see what happens.Steve tells author Peter Maas that he wants to change and he wants to change the way the gypsies live. The book ends there and we do not know if he was successful. The book is very very short. You can read it almost in 1 sitting. Some of the reviews are longer than the book.bbp okc ok2009
__label__2	Inside a Secret Nation: I bought this book on ebay, as it's been out-of-print for years. Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's. The telephone psychic industry probably cut into the market for fortune-tellers, so I wonder if the women now have regular jobs?
__label__2	Aids in hands-free phone usage: I use this phone holder every day on my commute, in conjunction with an auto charger and hands-free earset. I find it indispensable in securely fastening the phone in place, yet easily removable. It makes one-hand dialing easy, and I don't have to worry about the phone sliding around because of sudden turns or stops. One word of note: it doesn't accept the use of oversize extended-life batteries.
__label__2	Riveting: One of the best suspense books I have had the pleasure to read. The characters are a dynamic mix that make the story had to put down. You develop and understanding for the villian were you empathize with him while at the same time you feel for the hero and heroine to catch him. A must read for those who like suspense novels.
__label__1	I did not like it. Messy: I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine.
__label__1	Uninspired: Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry.
__label__1	DRACULA SUCKS: Too many characters that appear for a sentence or two and then just vanish into the London fog of the late 19th century.
__label__1	Come Watson, the games afoot!: Unfortunately, it's two left feet on this occasion. I bought the book as I am a big fan of both Holmes and Dracula stories, but despite the sometimes colorful characters, it was a tedious read.
__label__1	Waaaaay too much in this book for a mere 350 pages: This book needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book.
__label__2	"Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully ""out"". Living people (referred to as ""warm"") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."
__label__1	Anno Dracula Boring: The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. The characters were not believable and left me with wanting to many unanswered questions. The author took to many liberties with facts. All in all, I just didn't care for the book, skipped thru pages to end it so I could go on to more enjoyable reading. Amazon offers so many options and choices that I'm bound to pick a lemon once in awhile. I always read the brief description of the book before I buy but in this book that wasn't enough.
__label__1	Too many names, too little interest.: This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun.
__label__2	Please make a reprint of this book.: For me, Steampunk started with this book. It brought to me the beauty and anachronisms of the Victorian culture mixed with the surprises and action of modern sci/fi. My wife, who loves vampire stories probably even more than I do, had never read the book and when I went about trying to find a copy of it for her, it seemed impossible. Thank god for the internet (and to a lesser extent, Amazon). I was finally able to get a used hardback for a sum that wasn't too insulting. My wife tore through it and loved the weirdness as much as I do. It is crazy that this book has not had a recent reprint. Who ever is responsible for that should be slapped once or twice.
__label__2	So glad Titan Books Reprinted this!!: It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. How would the presence of vampires change Victorian, England? This is exactly what Mr. Kim Newman tackles in his thriller novel 'Anno Dracula'. Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this! I hope they continue with the sequel Anno Dracula: The Bloody Red Baron, which takes place in 1918, or I will have to get crafty and find an old copy myself!
__label__2	"Enthralling: I'm very glad to have discovered this original, complicated but enthralling book by Kim Newman. In this take-off of Bram Stokers Dracula, the Count survived execution and went on to become the consort of Queen Victoria in 1888. England is made up of the ""un-dead"" and the ""warm,"" and when a killer 'Silver Knife' begins murdering vampire prostitutes, they must work together to track him down. Many names from the original Dracula, as well as other literary works find this way into the story, which is fun.I had a little trouble sticking with this book at first--it is quite complex and with many characters--but once I got pulled in, I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this for fans of the original Dracula."
__label__2	"Alternate History meets Classic Horror: Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, ""Anno Dracula"" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks. If you liked Dracula and don't mind the occasional ""What If"" scenario then you might want grab a copy of this hard to find gem."
__label__2	Difficult, but all-around enjoyable: Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of.
__label__1	Anno dracula: Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea.
__label__2	"Great for drivers awareness: I have read some of the reviews and it appears to me that the ones who don't like this book are the children who had to read it. First of all this book is not written for each state, so you will have to check on your own state or county laws along with this book. As for this book not helping you pass the ""TEST"". Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the ""TEST"", which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them. But we as adults must continue the teach, and hope that some of what they read sinks in. When dealing with driving a vehicle, learning by experience a lot of times ends up to late. This book doesn't teach you how to pass the ""TEST"" it teaches you how to be a better driver, something we all need to be..."
__label__2	Boring but useful: I must admit, this book is pretty lame in its organization and all. But there was still a load of stuff that I wouldn't have known, so there is some useful content here. (Heh...I couldn't have passed my test without it...)
__label__1	Not worth your time!: As of now I am completing drivers Ed. We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual. If you think this will help you, try it, but I warn you, its not worth it. Your state drivers manual is worth you time, check it out!
__label__1	No Editor? Mediocre Content.: After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future.
__label__2	Read this if you carry concealed: This is an in-your-face, tell it like it is, discussion of the good and bad of carrying a concealed weapon. The snap decisions you might make under extreme pressure may have dire consequences unless you understand what you can and cannot do to defend yourself.Very enlightening. A quick read on a very serious matter.
__label__2	"A ""must read"" for any handgun owner: I ordered this on a recommendation from a coworker. He is a former Sheriff's Deputy and is thoughtful and level-headed. The information in the book is well reasoned and clearly explained and should be required reading for any new handgun owner or those considering a gun purchase for self-protection."
__label__1	Good ONLY for total beginner: I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
__label__2	Armed Response: is essential: If your looking for a great book that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. A great place to start be it a beginner or old timer this is a must read. David Kenik not only wrote well but put it in a format that is understandable. Well thought out! This is a must have book for anyone who wants to understand what is needed to justify an armed response. It does not replace personal training or what can be learned in a class (interaction). It does however build a great foundation for what is needed to to understand in responding with lethal force. If you own a firearm for personal protection than you need to own this book.
__label__2	"EXCELLENT FOR NOVICE OR EXPERT: For 36 years I have instructed a wide variety of novices, experts and ""so-called"" experts. This book will take you from nothing - to all you really need to know (unless you are into ""one-upsmanship"" or trying to prove something about your masculinity or lack of it). For those (who are using this forum to display their resumes) if you are insecure then you will take your stack of books and your ego and look for anything that might have been left out. You might even list all the books you have, but the truth is, if you are really good at real-life situations, whether actual military combat, law enforcement or the usual combat games, ....all the book-learning in the world is no replacement. This book is well worth what you pay for it, and that's the point of these reviews, not better-than-thou cynicism from would be intellectuals."
__label__2	Armed Response: This is a very good book for the person who plans to carry concealed firearms. The logic is clear and the recommendations are sound. Unfortunately, the proof reading is atrocious. In the early chapters paragraphs are repeated and there are other other problems. I lined out several sentences that were misplaced and had to tape in a loose page that came with the book. The book is sound and I would have given it a 5 if the proof reader had not messed it up.
__label__2	Book: Armed Response: A good book for Self-Defense folks. I was hoping for something new but it pretty much reiterated what we already know (preaching to the choir). Not a bad evening read.
__label__2	Informative: The book, although hard to get excited about in the begining, offers insight into confrontations that you experience any given day during your life. It's thorough and offers helpful ideas.
__label__1	Wasn't Impressed: Lots of diagrams and drawings, pointing arrows, etc. I felt as though I were back in class and was missing the required supplementary workbook.This book seems to address mainly work situations where the reader is the boss and having difficulty with a recalcitrant employee. There just wasn't much for me here to apply to my own life.
__label__2	LIFE CHANGINGING BOOK: THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ( WORK,RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME,FRIENDS),IF YOU UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK.IT CHANGED MY LIFE.MANY THANKS TO THE AUTHORS.
__label__2	Crucial Confrontations: A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship. Found it useful at work as a reference book, plus a great read for personal relationship communications as well. Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view.
__label__1	Old information: Unfortunately, I did not like this book. I found it difficult to read and boring, even though it was recommended by a friend..
__label__2	"TERRIFIC BOOK: I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."
__label__2	conversation tools: I liked the book and definitely picked up on tools for working thru violated expectations. Everyone could take away and use something from this book. Well worth the $s spent.
__label__2	Great job: I appreciate the books a great deal. They are wonderful tools for improving communication, which is something we all need, and especially when the stakes are high. Great book.
__label__2	An excellent approach to interacting management: I had a wonderful time reading the book (and taking notes). It reminded me of the multiple occasions in which I have failed for lack of skills, but also showed me that there is a methodology to follow next time I have to confront a violated expectation (probably within the next five minutes)
__label__2	Can't get too much of a good thing.: In Crucial Confrontations these 4 author/practitioners continue on the Crucial Conversation path. They begin with definitions of terms, move to concrete examples and provide useful tools for improving dialogue in tough situations, in all aspects of life and work.The ability to have a tool for measuring your abilities in holding crucial confrontations is appealing as we all like to know where we stand. They also offer lots of tools on their website that supports this current work - www.crucialconfrontations.comThere are no absolutes for how we hold crucial confrontations and these 4 authors provide a template from which to work so that anyone can be successful. Authentic, Credible and great to know you are not alone in this navigation toward improved communications.

__label__2	GREAT BOOK IN EVERY WAY: This is the ultimate book on Bettie Page. This book is for every true Bettie fan. Even contains an introduction from Bettie herself.If you really want to follow the history of legend, this is the ultimate book on Betty Mae Page!
__label__2	Uncovering the rage about Bettie Page: After years of seclusion, most of the secrets of, by and about Bettie Page are revealed in this well-composed and long overdue profile of the most photographed model in history.Ms. Page may still wonder at the inspiration and sensation (and consternation from members of Congress) she caused in the mid-1950's...what this book clearly does, is testify as to why her image is still sought after by fans and collectors.Easy, lively reading and plenty of pictures rates this as the best book available on the Page rage.

__label__1	Not for me: I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. I deleted it soon after.
__label__1	Great Record, Bad Remaster: I love this record. And I am also a big fan of remastered re-releases (Bowie, Roxie, etc.), but I was disappointed in the sound of this remaster. My Import version sounds MUCH better...a lot more raw, more vital, better definition between instruments. This sounds like a lot of compression, and not much more. Buy this record, but don't re-buy it for a better experience like I did.
__label__2	Great resource: I loved looking at this book. It covered a lot of variety of types of chests and provided interesting historical and culture facts, as well as personal stories for specific chests. The pictures to text ratio is perfect. I wish there was a little more information on consrtuction--there was some useful information on types of construction for the wood itself, but I would have liked to see information on materials/woods used, latches, locks, handles, and strapping/corners. Still, I am very happy with my purchase.
__label__2	Overall Good Book: Book was great and a nice read... but the cover was dirty, don't know why Amazon would sell a dirty book.
__label__1	An adventure story that fails: This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read.
__label__2	Cute book and a fast read: Absolutely charming book, great for all grade levels. I usually run for the gory, werewolfie or anne boleynesque books, but it was refreshing to pick up something sweet AND interesting for a change. Buy this for the MG reader in your life, but read it for yourself first!
__label__2	Good book for young teens: Ok, the kids accused me of reading it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids.
__label__2	"Riding in Cars or Boats with Kids: .Tom Bodett - the ""We'll leave the light on"" Motel 6 guy - wrote and performs this cautionary tale of respect for the whims of Nature for kids and their parents. Part ""slice of life"" in the Alaskan ""bush,"" part sociology - can ""bush"" and ""town"" kids find common ground and interests? and also a warning on why kids should listen to grown-ups (all these years and we really HAVE learned something ;-), this captivating adventure will while away the hours whilst travelling."
__label__1	"Keep looking - this ain't it!: I have to agree with the ""lousy"" review. It seems to be a decent setup,but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available, what is the point? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster ""shutter"" speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture. I wasn't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera, but this was a total loss. Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization?"
__label__1	"This item is a total scam: This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
__label__2	THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!!!!: The finest pop songwriters get a piece of their due with this three disc set. There were no finer writers than HDH during the second half of the twentieth century and this set is testimony to that. Sadly, most of these songs are available elsewhere and avid Motown fans will find this redundant. Great mono versions of a good chunk of their biggest hits but a second volume is called for with more of the post Motown output and a deeper look into the vaults for demos of some of the literally hundreds of top shelf songs these guys wrote. How did they do it? Don't have a clue but I sure do love these songs...
__label__2	"Excellent overview: This overview of the trio's songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you already own 75% of the songs. Has rare mono mixes of Freda Payne's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Chairmen Of The Board's ""Give Me Just A Little More Time."" Informative liners notes."
__label__2	An Excellent DVD Concert: As a survivor of the Woodstock generation these artists play the music I love to hear. The musicians are in excellent shape, the line-up is superb, the selections are well-chosen and the DDS 5.1 mix is a showroom example of a proper live concert mix. Ambient and live but clear and focused. All in all an excellent sounding DVD of some top-flight musicians and songwriters strutting their finest stuff with Sir George Martin adding some very fine string embellishments to many of the songs. If you like these artists and their music this DVD will not disappoint you.
__label__2	Excellent DVD: Music for Montserrat is an exceptional DVD. Every artist, Eric Clapton, Paul Mc Cartney, Elton John, just to name a few are wonderful and the sound is amazing. A great addition to anyone's DVD collection.
__label__2	rare concert, awesome audio: I recently watched this at a friend's house. He has an excellent surround sound setup and this DVD has DTS. amazing.as a habit I don't like live concert video - rarely buy them.the guest artists are phenomenal - Paul McCartney at the end is lots of fun/great songs.How many times are you going to see Clapton and Knopfler playing together, filmed well and in DTS?you just can't go wrong with this DVD.
__label__2	Outstanding content: I have a $20,000 stereo with DTS, SACD 3100 watts. This is far and away one of the best content, musicians, songs etc... that I own. The sound quality is a 4 out of 5 but the songs and musicians more than make up for it. A definite must for any audiophile.
__label__2	"Great Music: This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
__label__2	Great if you have the RIGHT sound setup: I almost sent this item back because the sound was so uneven going back and forth between loud and soft for no reason. luckily I ran across a comment by someone who mentioned you had to use 5.1 or DTS in the sound setup to get it to work right. Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect. After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others. Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in. If you think you might like this DVD you will, so buy it, just be sure you use 5.1 or DTS!
__label__2	"Very Nice!: Phil Collins singing ""Take Me Home"" and Mark Knopfler performing ""Brothers in Arms"" and ""Money for Nothing"" are fantastic; heck, Elton, McCartney, Sting, Eric Clapton, Sting, Jimmy Buffett, Carl Perkins and Arrow are all great. This is a wonderful concert; I just wish I could have heard it in person.This DVD looks fantastic and sounds terrific--especially on a DTS capable system like mind. I buy music DVD's only if I can see that they have DTS encoding on the disk (Amazon please take note). However, in a few places--just a couple--the sound quality of ""Music for Monserrat"" falls down a wee bit compared to other music DVD's I have; otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.That said, this is a great DVD for those like me who love these artists."
__label__1	Audio= Very Poor: First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine. Suggest you try something else.
__label__1	poor sound mix on many of the tracks: Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality.
__label__2	10 stars: This is one of the best video concerts ever. The sound, visuals and performances are top notch. It is a real joy. I have owned it a week and watched it 3 times already. Every performance is good. There are no dead spots during this concert and you get quite a number of them. A keeper. Memorable.
__label__1	McCartney Lovers Only: I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead.
__label__2	Definitely a collector's item.: It is extremely rare to see so many world famous super artists performing together in the same concert doing some of their greatest hits - Elton John, Sting, Mark Knofler, Carl Perkin, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Phil Colins etc. You must own this DVD before it is out of stock. I would have given it 5 stars should the audio recording be slightly better. Go and buy this one with confidence. I am sure you will not regret.
__label__2	"All-Star Lineup: This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
__label__1	Disappointed with the sound quality: If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore.
__label__2	This is a concert.: The world's best performers together. I guess the only one missing was Peter Gabriel, but oh well, he missed it.Extremely recommendable.
__label__2	Josef Strauss and the Family Formula.: London-born violinist and conductor John Georgiadis is in charge here, exhuming and enlivening long-forgotten dance music from the pen of Josef Strauss. After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule. Reliance on the family formula seems evident in most of the items on this CD, where you'll find a spanking little march, three waltzes, a quadrille and a variety of polkas, heard best at concert hall volume so that subtle lifts in rhythm and phrase and the skilful orchestration are heard to best advantage.
__label__2	Good Lens Cap: This is a good lens cap and does meet the purpose. Personally, I wish it had a hole in it so it could be attached to the camera like the original lens cap that came with the camera.
__label__2	Does what it says.: $9 isn't too bad for an OEM replacement lens cap. Needed to pick one up after mine was lost in the snow while skiing this winter. It works.
__label__1	Cannot Recommend It: This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo.
__label__1	Not enough information. Cap did not fit my model.: The item was not fully described. I thought it would fit my Rebel camera,however it did not.Nor
__label__2	More pricy, but nice to use: True, it is more expensive than non-Canon caps, but after all you are using it a hundred times on a photography day and it works the best (I have a $5 non-Canon one and every time I had to use it it felt cheap and flimsy). Just another small thing to enjoy your shooting more.One star off, as it still could be 30% cheaper.
__label__2	Quality product: Fits as expected and is well made. It lacks a cord to tether it to your camera but you can easily purchase one that sticks on the front if you feel you need one. I however prefer to just keep the cap in my pocket when the camera is in use so its not flopping around and getting in the way.
__label__2	Very good: I bought this lens cap as replacement for my stock on canon 70-200 F/4 none is L lens after I misplaced it.It fits perfectly good build quality from a plastic.
__label__2	Lens Cap: This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
__label__2	Funny!: I bought three copies of this book as funny Christmas presents, and they were a big hit. One of the people I gave it to, just after opening it, began to read several small sections aloud to the rest of us, and it was very entertaining.
__label__1	Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available: With all of the program changes, this book is very out of date. You can get a lot of the same information for free at http://www.certificationguide.com
__label__1	Decent start, then rambled: This book started out fairly interesting as being an insight to the impact of too much money on children and the relationship with their parents. Then, it goes into what one reviewer thought might be an opium trip (which I agree with) that went on and on and on, boring after the first couple pages. The end was so predictable, the entire book turned into a major disappointment.
__label__2	IMHO not for children: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again.
__label__2	Great for kids of all ages: Delightful story. The plot accomodates itself to children of all ages. Plenty of action, humor, and silliness - the ingredients my children seem to thrive on. Stuart is about a kid trying to find his place in the world. And aren't we all?
__label__1	"1 hour of static rain noise: Ok i admit. I'm not a brain music expert. I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say ""do not use while operating heavy machinery"" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."
__label__2	be careful with size: Great boot. Seems like it ran large. I usually wear a size 9 athletic shoe and sandal but this 9 swallowed my foot whole. Maybe it's becasue my foot is a bit narrow. No trouble returning and swapping for an 8 1/2. Solestruck is an excellent company to deal with. Great customer service!!I love these boots!
__label__1	Disappointing - additional equipment needed: We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom. After reading the reviews and descriptions we ordered this tape. On receiving it we found that every participant needs a set of dumbbells and ankle weights. Nowhere did we see indications that additional additional equipment was needed. We are now deciding whether to return this tape unopened. Please be aware that this tape is of dubious benefit unless you have access to dumbbells (the bar-bell type, not the student type) and ankle weights.
__label__2	Great Story!: I read this book in one day. That's a big deal for me. I thought the author did a fantastic job.
__label__1	Lots of adjectives, adverbs, and cliches: The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style.
__label__1	"Where is the ""Truth"": As a St. Louis resident during this crime, I was especially interested in this book. I was very disheartened when I heard Ms. Cummins interviewed on the radio and a police detective called in and challenged her account, claiming that she misquoted him. It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things."
__label__2	Greased Lightning: This story will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn't let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed. The lesson to be learned from this book, is that the majority of us at one time or another have walked to the fringe and escaped unchanged and luckier then we can imagine . A horrific tale that hopefully will save others a simliar FATE, It's difficult to comprehend that this is just one family's tragedy out of the thousands of cries of anguish that go on in silence. Trust me (or not), don't miss this book !
__label__2	A Page Turner: I read the review on this book in People Magazine and finished it in three days. It was a very well researched book and a real tribute to the Author's family. The whole family has a gifting in the written word, Tink, Robin, & Julie. The book was an easy read. I recommend you check it out.
__label__2	A Rip in Heaven: A very sad story of 2 lives lost,but they are remembered by there family. VERY true but sad story. RIP Julie and Robin Kerry.
__label__2	A Wonderful Composition: Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story.
__label__2	Good, fast reading story: This book was referred to me by a friend and it turned out to be a story that I coulnd't put down. From the beginning, it is a great story that captured my attention and brought a new realization to the happenings of the world around me. Overall, it was a fantastic read and something that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good book based on a true story.
__label__2	"Tugs at Your Heart Strings: ""An excellent memoir and true crime saga. It made me think about some issues, such as the death penalty and victims' rights. It took me about 50 pages or so to really get into it, then I couldn't put it down."""
__label__2	Riveting: I too read this book quickly, staying up one night until 2 or 3 in the morning, and I was riveted. I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young.
__label__2	"A families point of view: I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
__label__2	Out Standing: I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book.
__label__2	Good quality: I have bought two of these, about a year apart.The last one i bought had a nicer finish to the edges, not just cut leather.Really nice, and i get compliments all the time on it.
__label__2	"Enter Slayer: Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. 1, which is noteworthy for introducing the world to Metallica, Metal Massacre III's major claim to fame is that it unleashed thrash legends Slayer.The early Metal Massacre compilations are the best reflection of the American metal scene at the time, as such this 1983 release is full of power, traditional, and proto-thrash metal bands that are all clearly influenced by the NWOBHM scene. In addition to some of the ""name"" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene. These Metal Massacre albums are a great way to revisit that era, and are a must-have for all old-school metalheads."
__label__1	NOT what I ordered!: I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get.
__label__2	3 years later, it's still chugging along perfectly...: I noticed a few reviews complaining about their extension cords breaking down after just few months of usage, so I decided to let you all know that after nearly THREE years of use, mine works just as good as it did on day 1. It was cheap, does what it's supposed to, and hasn't failed me yet. Buy with confidence!
__label__1	I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful.: I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
__label__1	cheap, but not worth the money: This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement.
__label__1	Defective and more?: I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal.
__label__2	It works with my seven year old Sony Bravia: My husband is using the 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension to watch TV, with my seven year old Sony Bravia, while I listen to my audiobooks on my iPod. We have a very quiet home. He is happy with the sound.
__label__1	hmmmmmm!: i bought this so i can watch tv from the other side of the room. great idea. but some headsets dont work with it.. would have returned it but for the price ill keep it. you get what u pay for!
__label__2	AWESOME: i bought for my dad so he doesn't have to sit 3 feet away from the TV while my mom is sleeping. Now he can sit on the bed and lay down with another 5 ft to spare..
__label__2	headphone extension.: almost a year of use, and it still works great, this runs from our tv, to my treadmill, I exercise 6 days a week, and this is a fantastic extension.
__label__2	Works as desired: Not completely perfect, but reliable, and frankly, it extends the reach of my headphones. This is all I need it to do.
__label__2	works great: I use this to listen to ear buds at work but the computers are hidden under the desk so this allows me to have access to the jack. i can move around my cubicle with ease with these.
__label__2	Good deal: I am am a musician so I use these with earbuds coming off my computer within my headphones which is powered from my Marshall Amplifier. They transfer the sound well and are very well made.
__label__2	Does what it should do.: Works fine, seems to be as well made as you are going to get in a cheap consumer electronics accessory. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday - can't beat that for service.
__label__2	Much better quality than expected: I've noticed very little degrading of the sound, if at all, and this is rare in most extensions. The cord is thicker than usual for both the positive and negative polarities - a separate wire for each - and I'm quite pleased with this, will perhaps get another because of its thickness. I now have great headphone sound within a twenty-foot range - just what I was looking for. Even if you don't need 15-feet of cord, I would recommend this over the shorter 10 foot cords where the wiring is about half as thick and not likely to hold up over time...I subject all my electronics to heavy use. Plus, the best extensions for Grado headphones go for $40, and I'm quite satisfied saving over $30 by having this one.
__label__2	Works Great: Had this for almost two years because my computer jack is too far away to reach. Now I have found multiple uses for it. I can walk on my treadmill in my basement without having to turn up the volume on my tv. I just hook this up to the receiver and to my headphones, and I'm all set. I can even listen/watch media on my laptop with this extender while on the treadmill too. For the price, it's an excellent bargain.
__label__1	Good for about 1.5 years....: I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half.
__label__1	Stopped working after 2 months: Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
__label__1	Stopped working after a week.: Can't return, I guess, don't know how to get a hold of seller. Connections not good, I only get left ear speaker to work w/cord but without it works headphones work fine. So it's the cord. It's a shame really as the cord it self seems to be of good quality. Oh well, you can't judge a book by it's cover.
__label__1	poor fit ruins sound - avoid this product: Product arrived promptly and in good condition. However, the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones. If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault
__label__2	Sounds good: Sound quality is good for such an inexpensive item and long enough to let me move freely around in my office. Meets my needs
__label__2	Good Value: This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great.
__label__2	Good: What can you say about cables, either they work or they dont't. This cable funtioned as expected and the quality was good. A good deal at the price.
__label__2	Exactly as described, 15 feet of stereo 3.5mm headphone cable: Works as described, no distortion issues. I use this in my workout room so I can watch TV and wear headphones while I run.
__label__1	Didn't get what I ordered: I ordered the headphone extension (1 male end/1 female end) and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug (2 male ends). I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back.
__label__2	It works!: It's good price and works as expect. After a month of use it still going strong. The plug is sung. It keeps the headphone attached firmly.
__label__1	Sound Quality is Lacking: Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product. Glad I didn't waste more than I did on this.
__label__1	Great idea but mine's broken: Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now...
__label__2	"How Fun!: What fun it is to read a novel by one of my favorite ""corporate"" writers! This is a definite departure from the more business-like stylings of ""Diversity Blues - How to Shake Them"". I found myself drawn into the story, not only by the character development - but also by the subject matter. Without giving away any details, I'd like to say it's thought provoking and entertaining! A great drizzly afternoon read and a brain-teaser to boot. A reminder that you may not be as ""enlightened"" as you think you are!!"
__label__2	"Impressive and entertaining!: Once I picked it up, I found it very hard to put it down again and ended up reading into the wee-hours of the late evenings! Ms. Gossett's storytelling and ability to keep the reader in suspense was amazing! As I was reading it, I felt Ms. Gosssett was there in the room with me telling me a story!I also loved how she craftfully weaved in diversity themes throughout and it was refreshing to read a story based in Cincinnati where I have lived and worked.It was a real treat living out the story plot and trying to play out in my mind - Who dunnit? I was surprised at the ending and with the very last cliffhanger. I truley believe this would make for a great suspense movie and the book is as good as any Grisham novel I've read (and I have read them all!)!Kudos to Ms. Gossett who has ""come into her own"" and deserves so much success with this book!"
__label__2	Beautiful and well made!: Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star. The opinion of his contemporaries that Raff was one of the greats is borne out here. The 2nd movement is so lyrical, it is worth the price of the disk by itself. The orchestra, though perhaps not well known, gave an outstanding performance. It is a pity that my CD from Amazon contained no program notes unlike what another reviewer reported. However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!
__label__1	Melancholy views and interpretations: This book, was far too long, and was not at all appealing. The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories.
__label__1	Not Worth the Effort: It is very hard to find the logic in believing Freud when he himself was quite mentally disturbed and sick. Freud rationalizes things to death, he gives no hope, and removes all magic from the world. It seems, finally, that Freud is falling into disrepute after some years of popularity. He was never correct, only popular. If you want really important work in the field, then read Karl Gustav Jung, because, as I mentioned in the title, Freud is not worth reading.
__label__1	"A New Translation: This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."
__label__1	Laughing out loud: As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.
__label__1	No Table of Contents: Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me.
__label__1	Poor Quality Binding: Though the content of the text met expectations (it's a fairly canonical text), the binding on this book was terrible. It does not include any print or publishing information, making it nearly impossible to cite. There is neither table of contents nor an index, inexcusable for a text of this length and genre. The section breaks were unpredictable and poorly marked. Some new paragraphs began mid-sentence (clearly errors!) and often the section heading was indistinguishable from the paragraph in which it was imbedded. I highly suggest spending the money on a better quality version of the text.
__label__1	translator confusion: I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the ebook is J.A. Underwood.While this may be OK for the casual reader, this is not OK for someone approaching these texts in any kind of rigorous fashion.Whatever carelessness accounts for this error, it is enough to make me opt for a good old fashioned paperback instead.Fix it!
__label__1	It was a waste of money and time.: It's not at all what I expected. Still have not found what I was looking for in thefirst place
__label__1	disappointment: Was poor quality and some of the original text was not included- was not as described -should be removed from Amazon
__label__2	A New Older Edition: This 2005 publication is A.A.Brill's revised translation of Freud's masterpiece, its 3rd German ed. (1911). There were five more editions (to 1929), which are integrated in the standard edition translation by James Strachey (Avon/Discus pb 1965). This one, however, benefits from a creative intro by Daniel O'Hara and Gina MacKenzie, who correct some of the translation in an appendix, adding endnotes, comments, questions and valuable suggestions for further reading.
__label__2	"the hidden meaning of dreams: The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's ""Interprettation of Dreams"" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
__label__1	Hard read: Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary. Not worth it if you're not actually studying the subject or have advanced interest in psycho-analysis.
__label__1	Very bad edition: This edition is really bad. It is really ugly and has a lot of typos. I do not trust the translation either; it does not even specify who the translator is.
__label__1	"Don't buy NuVision Edition: I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
__label__1	Terrible book: My professor was not happy with this rendition of the book.He felt it was interpreted poorly and wanted me to buy another book.
__label__2	triplets: this is a different kind of movie and I love it. so very glad I found and ordered it. it's amazing. this came securely wrapped, great delivery, and quality dvd satisfied with service, and movie
__label__2	strangely wonderful: If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you.
__label__2	TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME SOUNDTRACK: Triplets of Belleville soundtrack and Belleville Rendevous are the same disc. The first is the USA version and the second is the UK version - the playlists are identical. They are being offered here as a two disc deal, but unless you're some sort of completist, this is no deal. I advised Amazon of this.
__label__2	"Amazing...but technology has its drawbacks: I first heard the Belleville Rendez-vous while watching the Academy Awards, and I have hardly stopped listening to this fantastic soundtrack since I got it in the mail yesterday! Jazzy, organic and original it's fun to listen to.But you should note that the CD has some sort of copy control technology on it -- it says in small print ""On some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered"". Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn't recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player. I'm not quite sure what to do about this glitch, and I'm not willing to part with the soundtrack, but this aspect of the CD sure is annoying."
__label__2	"In the vein of ""Chocolat"": What a delightful work of art. I was enchanted with the film and the music definitely caught my attention. I'm always looking for a little ""off beat"" music, i.e., Chocolat was my last favorite CD, but now this has moved up to first place. I highly recommend it for ecclectic music lovers who like that ""off beat, out of the way, different"" sound."
__label__2	"Erreur: ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" n'a pas reu le Jutra de la meilleure bande sonore, puisqu'il n'était pas en nomination. ""Gaz Bar Blues"" l'a remporté."
__label__1	The Triplets of Belleville: This a terrible story - boring at best. I am sorry I wasted my time watching it.
__label__2	A Smart and Sensitive Look at Power and Oppression: On the surface, this book offers startlingly beautiful language and heart-stopping imagery. But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art.
__label__2	"The Missing Link: ""Other Side of Love"" was never released on either of Yazoo's albums. It was released as a single between the two albums. After years of searching I finally found it on CD!!""Other Side"" is a happy upbeat tune that has a bit that sounds like ""Just Can't Get Enough"" which after all Vince wrote for Depeche Mode.If you have both albums get this single and complete your Yazoo songlist!"
__label__2	"For 4 year olds AND 1 year olds!!!!!: Would you believe that my 1 year old dances to this? I bought it for my daughter, who is 4 years old, and when my toddler hears the music, he comes racing in and starts bouncing around. It is a great piece...very educational, extremely easy to follow with or without the dancers on the video (we have the music CD), and I don't mind playing it at all. My daughter's favorites are ""Shake a Leg"", ""The Circus Dance"", and when ""The Bingo Rainbow"", she runs around the house trying to identify her colors."
__label__1	What Happened?: Okay, first off, I love Loving Family. I have the Twin Time and all of the accessories AND the old dolls. But when I received the new dolls as I gift, I was shocked. Mattel has completely changed the dolls from sleek to chunky. These dolls apparently look a lot like the ones they made back in the 90's. If you want dolls for your Loving Family house, try to get the old ones on eBay.
__label__1	"Give us a break!: Not sure why there's such a love-fest here over this charger?? Fact is, we're talking about roughly eight bucks in parts & plastic that Canon is marking up too much. After spending so much on the camera, it's insulting to the notion of ""customer service"" that they are charging this price for a replacement charger. At least they could make it a rapid-charger enhancement or something - after all, why should it take two hours to re-charge your camera?Listen Canon, if you want five-stars from customers, treat us better, and sell replacement parts at cost. No need to take advantage of us just because we lose a part that makes our wonderful camera as useful as a stone."
__label__1	"Item did not work: I was shipped what appeared to be a refurbished charger. On top of the fact this item was refurbished, it did not work. As if the upset and inconvenience of receiving a product that does not work wasn't enough, once I returned this item to sender they had the audacity to charge a ""restocking fee"". I certainly won't ever purchase from this seller ever!"
__label__1	Canon Battery Charger for NB-5L Batteries: I would like to say that all of my dealings with Amazon have been wonderful, fast, and not a problem. The only reason I gave this unit a below rating is because the pictures showed a unit that just plugged into the wall, like the one that came with camera. When it arrived, I opened it up and I found a plug-in cable, then a charging box (gray), plus a battery. So I was not happy about the pictures not being the same one as I thought I had ordered, I was expecting the one with the folding prongs. Otherwise, Amazon would get a 5 on this review.
__label__1	What a rip off!: I needed a charger because i misplaced mine. I an stunned they want $36 for this thing that should not cost more than $10.
__label__1	inaccurate description: The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new. I got it in the mail after about 2 weeks (from Japan), and it had scratches all over it. I would not buy from this seller again.
__label__1	Said it would Work.: Im going to return mine they said it would work for my Cannon Sd1000 and it didn't I wish they did more research before saying it would work. It was cheaper than buying new though but I have the hassel of sending it back.
__label__2	Worked great: I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . This is the exact same one that comes with the camera , and the shipping was fast too.
__label__1	Does not work: The charger does not charge my battery! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet. Rather, it has a separate cable that goes to the adapter itself and the outlet. It's junk! I am absolutely disappointed!
__label__2	Perfect replacement: My original charger lost a battle with salt water, which turned it into a discharger. The replacement is exactly the same as the original, except the replacement works! My favorite pocket camera is back in business.
__label__2	Cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else: I didn't want to risk a generic charger and got the Canon brand at the lowest price at Amazon.
__label__2	Canon CB-2LX Battery Charger for SD800IS: It plugs into the wall, it charges the battery. What more can I say? My recommendation is keep track of the one that came with the camera so you don't have to spend the money on a second one.
__label__2	Fantastic product that is pdenticle to original charger: The product works perfectly and I am extremely pleased with it. I can tell no difference between this charger and the original charger that came with my camera. Shipping was fast and professional.
__label__2	Battery Charger: Purchased this item to have a second charger on hand for my new camera. Identical to the OEM at a very good price.
__label__2	Exactly Like My Original: I lost my original charger and bought this to replace it and it works just like the original. Very happy about this purchase!
__label__2	Cannon charger: This is a great product. I thought that I had lost the orignal(left in a hotel room)so I needed a replacement. It is the best! Found my other charger and now I have two. Great! I use the other one for the office. Great product from Cannon.
__label__1	wrong item: the battery charger that I received did not have a plug. In the picture it shows a plug thatcan directly be plugged into a power outlet. The chrager did not have the plug nor a cord w/plug.I needed to use it today for a college project and had to go out and buy an additional cord.I would like to have sometone contact me about this problem.Thank you. Silvia Bryan
__label__2	works like a charm: works like a charm. i had misplaced my original charger and this is a MUST to use the camera.great price and shipped in plenty of time.
__label__2	Just like the one that came with the camera: Just like the one that came with the camera, works perfectly and fit the battery it says it will. Awesome.
__label__2	Camera Battery Charger: I have used this product in the past with great success. I ordered more because I had misplaced my original one.
__label__1	wrong item.: They shipped me CB-2LV not CB-2LX, I think a chimp that is mentally challenged could have read the label on the back of the charger and put it into the package. This is pathetic.
__label__2	Buen cargador: Product very good, I am of Venezuela the exelente product thanks(Producto muy buenos, soy de venezuela el producto exelente gracias)
__label__1	refused my return: I emailed the company 3 times requesting permission to return unused item and they never got back to me. I am stuck with a product I do not want that I bought by mistake. Bad business.
__label__2	Regular 'ol Charger: Plain old charger that comes with the sd870is that I forgot the charger for when I went home for Christmas. Works just fine.The only thing that I can complain about is Amazon's shipping; I ordered it with 2-day shipping and since I ordered it the tracking said that it would arrive Dec. 22nd. Well, the 22nd came and went, then when I checked the tracking it said that it was on time and would arrive the 23rd. Wait, if it was on time then it would have arrived the 22nd...? OK... Thanks Amazon, so much for 2-day shipping...
__label__2	It arrived. It charged. Camera works.: Somewhere out there on this Earth, there are three other equally well-made chargers I've misplaced. Until I stop losing these illusive chargers, I will continue to buy them to feed my photographic addiction.
__label__2	Battery charger: My new battery charger works perfectly! I was so glad to find it for such a reasonable price! It is nice to have my camera back! Thanks Amazon!
__label__1	Doesn't work: I was looking forward to using my canon powershot again as I'd misplaced my original charger while traveling. I take the charger out of the bag, not box, and plug it in only to find that it does not work - it's not charging at all. No light, no power when I put the battery back in my camera. Will ship it back very soon for a replacement or refund!
__label__1	Mislead: I feel that I was mislead when purchasing this product since when I googled replacement battery chargers for my Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph, this site came up as having a compatible charger. However, when it arrived it WAS NOT COMPATIBLE!!! It cost me the postage both ways and a huge waste of time. This vendor should be more specific in advertising!! I got ripped off on this deal!!
__label__1	The product never work: This is the first time I buy a product from this provider and I will never do it again, they sold me a charger without a box and that looks kind of used, when I try to charge my batteries they never did it. After a couple tries I went to a local dealer and got a brand new that made a great job in a couple hours.
__label__2	Works fine: I had to buy a replacement for a camera battery. This works just fine but I do wonder why they charge such a high price for this little charger. Guess they know the camera is useless without it?
__label__2	Perfect replacement for a lost charger: If you happen to misplace the factory charger, this is the exact replacement you need for the cameras listed. There were no flaws in the product, and it came in safe packaging.The only problem is cost, but I wouldn't use an aftermarket charger so I was prepared to pay for the real thing. If you lose your Canon battery charger, go ahead and order this.
__label__1	"Not worth the price: Keep getting ""Driver Open Fail"" message. No solution availabe, this renders the camera unusable. Save your money."
__label__1	Vivitar Should Be Cast Into the Deepest Pit of Hell: Being a camera aficionado and collector, I picked this up at Walmart to play around with. Even THAT'S not possible... see, there's no support for Mac OS X. Vivitar's website claims no driver is needed for OS X, that an icon appears on the desktop in Classic Mode. That's a cynical, damnable LIE! Until some similarly-wronged Code Warrior writes a driver for this, I can't affirm to you that the dynamic range of this sweetheart sucks eggs, but that's what I've been told.It really deserves negative stars. I used to love Vivitar SLR stuff. Now they don't even answer email inquiries and complaints. Vivitar should be cast into the deepest pit of Hell for all eternity.
__label__1	Another - case of can't download pictures from camera: This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	nonsense: Can not get the pictures off the camera. Keeps saying faliure when try to download or go to website.
__label__1	I bought this as a Christmas present!: Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar!
__label__1	This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???: I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM. Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for.
__label__2	Janet doesn't beat Michael's Tours, but it's still amazing!: The little sister of the Jackson family has done it her brother's way. U will find her doing theatrical moves, modern dancing moves, and sexy moves. It's worth buying, because it's something u will want to watch over and over again instead of once only. so be smart and buy it cause it's worth it all!
__label__1	JANET JACKSON - VELVET ROPE TOUR: Well another one of my first dvd purchases...I found this concert very poor...it did nothing for me... the sound quality was poor, The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle, Janet's performance was glitzy... but sadly something was missing...my advice is puchase Janet's later DVDS...
__label__1	Fire the editor, sue the director, annihilate the producer: This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. I saw The Velvet Rope in concert and absolutely loved it! This DVD however is a disgrace to Miss Janets talents. The sound is awful and the editing even worse. All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you. Otherwise we can only hope somebody makes a re-edit and remix version so the world can finally see a worthwile version of the concert. What a shame, what a waste.
__label__2	It Was A Blast: Janet Is Truly Amazing . I Went To See Her Concert Here In Johannesburg , South Africa . It Was Unbelievable . I Bought The Vhs Tape Of The Velvet Rope And Now I Am Back To Buy The Dvd Version . I Can Watch The Tape Over And Over Again . Janet Is Truly Entertaining . I Actually Did Not Expect The Concert To Be That Great , But I Would Really Stunned . The Choreography Was Really Out Of This World . I Recommend This Movie To Everybody . For 2 Hours , You Are Transformed To A World Of Magic And Excitement . I Can Guarantee That You Will Love It . Thank You Janet For Your Outstanding Performance , It Will Honestly Remain A Part Of Me For A Very Long Time ! !
__label__2	The One and Only... MS. JACKSON (If you are nasty): This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet, lovers of music, and owners of quality DVDs.
__label__2	beautiful representation of janet as a person: this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included.
__label__1	Low quality dvd: I know I am just writing this review now but the dvd I purchased was not in good quality. I am not sure it because the actual concert was 10 to 15 year old but I did not enjoy this copy at all.thank you,Charisse Chase
__label__1	"bad deal: This DVD could not be played all the way through. I tried skipping past the ""bad part"" but no dice...it simply would not play. I was really looking forward to this video and will not buy from this seller again. The only good thing was that my money was returned (less the handling fee!) Feel like I was penalized for using this seller."
__label__2	what else can i say she is JANET!: this tour is like a representation of janet as a person what she feels and what she wants in life and what she is looking for and basically happiness i personally enjoy janet in everything she does because she does it so well!
__label__1	"I must be the only one...: I saw this tour and the DVD was a big letdown. I thought the sound quality was poor, at best. Hollow and ""boomy"" bass are all I notice.I very much WANTED to love this video, but cannot."
__label__1	Are we discussing the same DVD?: Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?
__label__2	"Pure art in sight, sound and motion. JDJ as the Velvet One.: This is a highly entertaining show that you can watch over and over again. It deserves an Amazon.com double five star rating, it is that good. Think, if you will, of the Velvet One's rising to the top in spite of her talented and tabloid catching siblings and in spite of the emergence of girl groups who are flooding the airwaves and CD displays with soundalike claptrap which has only a catchy phrase or a man-slam to its merit. (Pay some dues, girls.) Look at the Velvet One's performance in the concert showstoppers--""Alright/I Get Lonely/Rope Burn"" ""Black Cat"" ""What About That"" ""Rhythm Nation""--I mean...is she great or what? And look at how many of the Velvet One's tunes you know by heart. There ain't that many performers out there of Janet's calibre at all these days...well, maybe a few of 'em. They seem to be calling themselves ""diva"". Oh well. Thanks, Velvet One, from saving us from an entertainment void."
__label__2	TOO HOT TO TOUCH!: THIS CONCERT WAS SO HOT. I REGERT NOT SEEING HER WHEN SHE CAME TO HOTLANTA. WE DO HAVE THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE. WHEN I SAW IT ON HBO I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE MY PERSONAL COPY. THANKYOU JANET FOR PUTTING IT ON DVD.
__label__2	MISS JANET...SHOULD I SAY MORE?!!!: I TAPED THE SHOW THE NIGHT IT AIRED WHILE IT WAS TAPING I WAS AT THE SHOW, TOO HOT, MISS JANET TORE IT UP. EVERYONE WAS SINGING WITH HER. IT WAS SO LOUD, SOMETIMES YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR IT, BUSTA WAS THERE, T-BOZ, AMONG ALOT OF CELEBS WHO WERE THERE, LISTEN, ENOUGH WITH THE TALK, JANET IS TOO FIERCE, GET THE TAPE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
__label__2	it's all about the music: This concert is all about the music and art with a little bit of sex, but after this she became way too sexual in a classless way. Although janet's career is suffering right now, she will bounce back. Hey, even Velvet Rope started out slow and started picking up once Together Again was released, Damita Jo should too once the new single All Nite becomes a hit. So buy this DVD today, it's all about the music
__label__1	"Do not waste your money!!: This DVD will not load in your player. You will get a message, ""this cannot be played, not a compatible format"". Hopefully Amazon.com will allow me to return this DVD. This was a bad purchase for me."
__label__1	Didn't work: Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. I could only get it to play on my computer. No good.
__label__1	Not one of her best...: I didn't really like it. The best part of the show to me was the intro.She seemed to never change that boring outfit. She was way too thin, and her outfits should've been tailor made as they were drooping off of her. She appeared darker, and her hair was way too long and in the way.I do see some Madonna in here, but I don't know who's copying who because they both came out around the same time. But I guess Madonna beat her to the over the top concert extravaganza's.I also saw some of the same moves that Michael did.Her most recent tour seems better than this.
__label__2	Janet!!!: Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
__label__2	good: The concert was her best. Great twists and turns on the concert, kept my attention most of the time.
__label__1	Wack She ain't Michael: Janet Jackson works very hard.I will give her that But when she isn't biting Madonna, she is trying hard to be a 2nd tier Version of Her Brother which she will never be able to do.She can't sing& is a So-So Dancer.The Music&Production is what really has Her Name up in Lights in the First&Only Place.
__label__2	"Superb: Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. ""Man of La Mancha"" has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short, heart-warming play that is, if possible, even greater than the source material.In ""Man of La Mancha"", the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is ""insanity""? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"
__label__1	Didn't even know it was a play!: Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this book is because I've heard of it before and I'm trying to read some classics.Who knew it was a play? Not me!A little hard to understand, but after I got past the introduction, I quite enjoyed the play itself. It was very funny.Not sure if you like this kind of thing, but it was just ok for me.
__label__1	Not my favorite: I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. The plot is so crazy that it is hard to get a grasp on what is happening until halfway through the book. One you do figure it out, it is rather humerous, but not one of my favorites by any means.
__label__2	An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists...: Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records.
__label__2	Handheld slots: This is a fun little toy. My son got it this past Christmas when he was 5. When you get the winning three in a row, the machine spits out all of your change. You can put any coinage in the slot.
__label__1	Such a boring toy: I purchased this slot machine thinking it was larger than it was and also hoping it would at least perform a little better than it did. It doesn't even require a coin to release the jackpot. Overall, this machine is not worth purchasing.
__label__1	Immediately broke: Broke the very first time I pulled the handle. Very dissappointed, was going to give as a Christmas present. Made very cheaply, only good point was that it arrived on time.
__label__2	Nobody would believe this in a novel...only true crime!!: It is hard to imagine how the three characters in this triangle came to be involved, but the author did her research well (complete with photos) and shows us how it all happened. How could this multi-millionaire make such terrible bizarre decisions? And this is a true story!
__label__2	"BUDDY HOLLY ""Revealed"": I have been a Buddy Holly fan since I first heard him on the radio in my home town of Sydney, Australia.Whilst we heard all his songs, the main songs that is, it took many years, over 50, for me to be able to access a detailed visual history of his life and times and friends.It was great to see the other players who worked with him in those days eg a very young Waylon Jennings.A brilliantly put together documentary, even my wife found it very interesting! Although she got a bit sick of me falling asleep with the DVD player on and it defaulting to ""That'll be the Day"", in the early hours of the morning.A great contribution to those interested in the history and pioneers of Rock n Roll!"
__label__2	Very, Very Satisfied !: I really like to Thank's for this Amazing book, well done ... this book is a beauty and fully contain a lot of informations about my beloved XBOX System ... and more ... a lot of more .... I want to say for all .... Buy this item and enjoy ! ;-)
__label__1	The Black Art of Xbox mods: Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer. More details on opperating systems with the Xbox would have been helpfull. One still needs the internet and a good knowledge of where to go in order to find the rest of the puzzle.
__label__1	MODDERS RUIN THE GAME!: You may think you are cool because you took the case off of your X-Box and (wow) followed a 6 step process to install your loser chip.But really you're just a cheater.Why are you playing?If you want to win games consider practice.It is a game.Once you start cheating now it's just a joke.Modding for the purpose of unlocking the xbox's media center functionality is one thing - that's fair use in my opinion, but modding to boost your rank is immature and ascinine.Why do you care what your rank is if you have such low regard for the game itself????
__label__1	bad: The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Do not buy- very poor product.
__label__2	Build Skills From Ground Up: Excellent DVD, Explain concepts and methods very clearly. Great DVD to have as a guide and give the practitioner of the arts lots of ideas.
__label__1	bad product: i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness.
__label__2	great accessory: i love this harness as it makes it so easy to cary the IM7 around. just understand that with this harness, most of the speaker and the controls on top are not protected. the purpose of this harness is to make the IM7 transportable, no to completely protect it as the bag does.
__label__2	IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great!: Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!
__label__1	"5 star movie , 1 star copy !! SHAME !!: i love this movie, but when i watched this dvd version of it, i thought for a moment that my tv was playing up.the sound and image are dreadfull !!!! adjusting sound and vision on tv doesn't help either, i prefer copying a video tape on dvd myself.that's not all, nowadays we expect a dvd to come with trailers, documentarys etc.. you know some extras to enjoy the whole surrounding that made the movie. here: NOTHING ! nothing at allcompare this with dvd of ""mildred pierce"" or ""straight jacket""they come with FAB extras.this dvd version is done with no effort at all."
__label__1	A tresured noir given poor picture quality by KINO: The movie is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. However, the grainy gooey VHS-like picture quality can only be attributed to a very poor and shoddy transfer by KINO.
__label__1	Brilliant Movie - Dreadful DVD: Kino Video ought to be embarrassed to release such a poor quality print on DVD. What everyone has said about the transfer is true. It is truly dreadful. There are better copies of this film on VHS. At one point Joan backs away from the camera in horror until her performance is nothing but a fuzzy blur.Joan Crawford's work deserves better treatment. Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film. Keep your fingers crossed.That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending. That milk! Those eyes! But why does Joan's character cry out in warning at the end of the film only to smirk pridefully as she walks away?
__label__2	I'm sooo happy: I am sooo happy now that I finally have this DVD - rarely recognized fantastic film noir - Joan's best and Jack Palance's first movie break. Riveting. Arrived on time and in perfect condition!
__label__2	Palaver with Palance: Perfect casting, careful pacing, and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir. Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow. Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame, and, though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock, the details are utterly jolting!
__label__2	The best laid plans...: Joan Crawford chews the scenery, Jack Palance looks ugly and menacing, and Gloria Grahame slinks around in this fabulous film noir. Crawford is a wealthy socialite and playwright who marries Palance, an actor she had previously rejected from one of her plays. Turns out he has a girlfriend (Grahame) and they're plotting to murder Joan for her money. Joan finds out and decides to beat them to the punch (so to speak) by hatching a plan to murder her husband and frame his lover for the crime, complete with a little dream sequence showing the audience how it's supposed to turn out. In the middle of the plan, however, Joan loses her nerve...and that's when things get really interesting. The suspense starts about halfway through the film, when Joan discovers the plot against her, but the last ten minutes of the film dials up it a few levels. A must for any fan of Crawford and/or film noir.
__label__1	Frustrated in my search: Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD. Will keep looking elsewhere for a quality transfer.Am also stymied in not being able to find a CC version. I show these wonderful old film noirs to my 92 year old Dad who is deaf; without CC, it's impossible...
__label__2	Could be Crawford's Best!: Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!
__label__1	Great Movie But Awful Sound Quality by KINO: This is one of those great film noir classics and Crawford gives one of her great performances. However, all of this is marred by the poor sound quality by Kino. I had to turn up the volume on my TV all the way to hear it. Crawford (in her last Oscar nominated role) and this superb film deserve much better.
__label__2	Fun movie, Terrible DVD especially for the price: This movie was fun and over the top. An exciting thriller worthy of purchase, but not until the price drops. The sound is terrible. I had to crank up the volume. The picture quality is fuzzy at times. Also, there are no extra features, not even a trailer. No captions. Nothing. Bare bones. Rent it only, you won't regret this watching this.
__label__2	Spine Tingling Thriller!: Joan plays Myra Hudson, a successful playrite who marries Jack Palance then discovers an awful truth....Now watch Joanie go to work in a very clever way to out fox the villians......It is no surprise to me that Miss Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for this edge of your seat Hitchcockian like thriller...It is a job very well done and Miss Crawford deserves a vivacious round of applause!! ATTA GIRL JOANIE!!!
__label__2	sudden fear: i think sudden fear is a very good example of the so called films noirs and also joan crawfords performace is very convincing as the frightned woman who tries to save her life as well as she can
__label__2	fun,gripping film noir: even for those of you who don't like the older films this one might grab you. good example of film noir with dramatic music, dramatic lighting and well-picked cast. the plot involves a devoted husband and a scheming husband. plot accelerates into a mind-blowing climax.
__label__1	Masochist Dearest: Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance.

__label__1	Bad Product--great company. Responded immediately to problem with product.: The product was defective. Could not be cranked down. Bolts were missing from package. The company offered to replace and shipped me the missing bolts. I reccomend the company but not this jack.
__label__1	Embarrassing but No Disrespect meant: I was enjoying the author's story but about a quarter of the way through I became embarrassed for her as the author is presenting a racist view point on her story. She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony. If you are that clueless to these types people using you, you need a check up from the neck up. If you want a real story; read Richard Dry's book called Leaving for a true African-American story.
__label__2	Insightful: Thought this book was excellent. She has taken the time to practice some of the things that others are doing even though its not her lifestyle and she has found it to be of benefit to her.
__label__2	Life Changing Memoir: I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly.
__label__2	Very good reading: I had never even heard of this book. I was in the bookstore looking for The Coldest Winter Ever & it was out of stock (again). So I happened to see No Disrespect by Sr. Souljah & took a chance on reading it. I finished it in 5 days. Excellent reading, it held my attention. I recommended this book to a few of my friends.
__label__2	If you value the essence of storytelling let this story...: This story weaves many of our public and private lives as African American and the sorrow and joys that we must face being the in that # that is destined to succeed in the odds against the 85%.
__label__1	Offensive: I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that.
__label__2	No Disrespect but...: I've been reading this book lately. It was one of the first books recommended to me as to be really good. It is pretty good and I have to admit Sister Souljah does tell it like it is and she sounds very respectful towards herself and others. Personally I think she was too goodie-goodie, though. She stays monogamous for way too long. I'm not going by other reviews either. I don't know any girl that thinks as pure as her, and I know goodie-goodie girls! But all in all, the chapters are pretty much like glue and they're realistic. The book is definitely good and I do recommend it. Especially for people who like being in touch with who they really are. I definitely want to keep reading on.
__label__2	A Wake Up Call: I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others.
__label__1	"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER: And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
__label__1	Racist and stereotyped: I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly written) tripe. Whine, whine, whine. Take some responsibility for yourself. Bigoted, empty, hateful nonsense from a vacuous, race-baiting hack suffering a dearth of originality, an abundance of misguided vitriol, and an excess of hand-wringing and pouting disguised as legitimate literature.
__label__1	"No Disrespect? - How about ""No Clue"": More nonsense about the typical knee jerk, finger pointing, resentment that takes all focus off personal responsibility. Grow up."
__label__2	One of the best stories ever: I recomend this book to any young african american and women who are having problems at home and with their peers...Pick up this book...it will help alot. Wonderful book Sister Souljah
__label__2	I love Sister Souljah: This book is a must read. Sister Souljah comes live and direct. Nothing sugar coated. This book is the real deal. Any black woman can probably relate to everything in this book, especially the different relationships she encounters. Go grab this book my beautiful people!
__label__2	"Giggra: This is one of the best books I have ever read. I don't keep my books after I read them. If they are hardcover I donate them to the library. If they are soft cover and I can't find someone to give them too, as much as I hate to, I toss them in the trash. Which is why I now have a Kindle. I have had this book since 2000 when I read it. I LOVE this book. It was well written and I personally identified with it, being of the same generation as the author. I was inspired by the words I read. Between Morrison's The Bluest Eyes and this book....""WHEW"" is all I can say. If I had a teenage daughter I would give her this book to read just like my father gave me ""Young, Gifted, and Black"" to read. I never read the same book twice, with the exception of this book. LOVED IT!!!"
__label__1	"Another boring book about oppression.......................: I must agree with the reader from Louisville. This is just another work about a black person blaming the ""white man"" for their misfortunes. This topic is so old and boring.I agree that there is a MASSIVE racial problem in this country, but do we need to be reminded of this EVERY DAY?!I've used to hear her radio talk shows in the early 1990's and must agree that she is a racist."
__label__1	Whitey is oppressing you?: They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her books. Most whites in this country will never have such a luxury. Hypocrite. Racist.
__label__1	Horrible Horrible...Just Go to Borders: I ordered this item on or around August 15th. It is September 13th and I have still not received this item. I emailed the shipper on numerous occasions about the item. The shipper even went as far as to lie and state that my shipping information was lost. I provided the shipper with my shipping information yet again and still did not receive the book not to mention the shipper stopped responding to my emails. Needless to say I had to file a claim with Amazon and I just went and bought the book from Borders....just buy books or whatever else this shipper is selling elsewhere...it may be more but at least you will get your item!
__label__1	"No Disrespect: You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
__label__2	This is a Life Changing Book!: As I read No Disrespect, I developed a new respect for Sister Souljah - for she is bright, strong, sober, calculating, and in your face, telling it like it is! I've read works of so-called prolific writers more than twice her age, yet none have touched nerves and brought revelation to me as she has in No Disrespect!I smiled to myself as I read the penetrating questions she asked the people in her life. I admire her! I wish every Black man and woman could and would read this enlightening tome, for it is a life changing adventure into a world where knowledge is king! The multitude of lessons learned are a by-product of a very entertaining read!
__label__2	BADDEST BOOK I'VE READ!!!: FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT ALL TEENAGE GIRLS READ THIS BOOK. I FOUND IT TO BE VERY UPLIFTING, & LIKE EVERY DAY LIFE. MUST READ!!
__label__1	this is not the way to change things.: a friend of mine had said this book was ab-soul-lutely stunning, and i'm disappointed to say it was anything but. The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book.
__label__1	"I Support What She Says, But I don't believe It: I read ""No Disrespect after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found ""No Disrespect"" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent"", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."
__label__1	Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.: Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is.
__label__1	Not the real deal: We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them.
__label__2	Close to Parallels: If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels.
__label__2	Continuing the trendy radio feel,still too good!: Yeah it got a lot of radio friendly tunes but still this album is real good.Songs like the opening track,Monument & The Strand are the highlight of this album,FW never let down.
__label__2	A truly beautiful recording, very personal and deep: A lot of people hate this album. I guess is because is of the softer more retrospective style. For me this album is great, far better than Paralles. As a painter and graphic artist is one of the albums a use to get in the mood to paint and create. You can find here some of the most personal and beautiful of the band's songs like, Pale fire, Shelter Me, and Island in the Stream. Plus you get one of Fates's most awesome progressive tracks- Monument. Overall an excellent production.
__label__2	Fates Warning is killer.....: Fates Warning continues to push the envelope. They blend melodic riffs with bone crushing symmetry for that just right mix. This albulm is miles ahead of shades....If you like Dream Theater or Queensryche, this is a must for your collection...Its your Fate.......
__label__2	Fates warning.. rule`s..: THIS ALBUM RULE`S. ALL FATE`S WARNING MUSIC IS AWESOME, THAT GUY DOWN BELOW, WHO SAID THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM HE EVER HEARD? WELL, HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN`T KNOW REAL MUSIC. {He must be a wanna be?} RAY ALDERS VOCAL RANGE`S ARE INCREDIBLE!!! MARK ZONDER AWESOME ON DRUMS.... JIM MATTEOS BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF STRINGS ... do yourself a favor buy this cd.and all the other one`s Awaken The GUARDIAN ~ my favorite all time Fate`s album NO EXIT another great one ! FATES WARNING RULES....
__label__1	Disappoitment: It was first FW album I've listened to. And I'm afraid I'll never buy their CDs again. I don't want to waste my money. Well, I've heard FW is one of the prog metal monsters. Perhaps... Dream Theatre, for instance, doesn't have any such a pale album. This album has just some elements of progressive. If I have not heard it's prog rock group I'd never supposed it's progressive. Ok, the CD now is in used CD department and I hope I'll return some money.
__label__1	"Sci-Fi Natural Law: Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
__label__2	A Real Page Turner: Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
__label__2	Take the good with the bad: Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?
__label__2	Entertaining Education: A good choice for those who are not a ble to make it to birthing class, or those that want additional information. Funny, witty and covers everything from start to end.
__label__2	Kim's review: These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting.
__label__2	Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Don't have enough time or money for Childbirth classes? Are the classes full? Watch this video instead! Really thorough and informative. It has the same information as classes for about a tenth of the price.
__label__2	I LOVED THIS VIDEO: The lady is kinda annoying. But the videos made me feel prepared and made me feel comfortable with my decision to not go to any formal classes, these were more than enough.
__label__2	So helpful!: I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. I was bound and determined to do a VBAC with my second, but didn't want to redo the hospital birth classes. Got these DVDs, watched them once with my husband and several times on my own. Extremely educational, entertaining and helpful. Had a successful, drug-free VBAC and used much of the advice and information DVDs while laboring.
__label__2	"pretty helpful: My husband and I both enjoyed this helpful dvd to better prepare us for the ""BIG"" day. We were not able to go to an actual birthing class because of his work schedule. There are a lot of reviews complaining about how the birthing instructor isn't very funny and somewhat cheesy, but it's really not all that bad. We both found her to actually be humorous in most parts. This dvd is very easy to understand and is great, especially for new parents like us. I def recommend it, and also, if you have netflix, you can rent it instead of buying it. But it's dvd by mail only, not instant streaming."
__label__1	Hard program to watch: This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth.
__label__2	Super Informative...nice alternative.: I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!
__label__2	informative: I think the video was really good, im a nurse so i know most of the information already but it will hopefully help my husband. I think my husband preferred the video to an actual class. I mainly chose to use a video because of my schedule. The only thing I would have liked to see a little more was ways to help deal with the pain- like more breathing techniques. Overall I think it was good and would reccomend it.
__label__1	Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!: This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff.
__label__1	Don't waste your money: I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her.
__label__1	not worth the money: i felt like i was being talked down to the whole time. Me and my wife found this video to be a waste of money. The women in the video seem uninterested with what was going on and the video as a whole felt very out of date. Do not waste your time with this video.
__label__1	Long winded.: This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you.
__label__1	"Way too annoying: I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her ""funny stories"". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear."
__label__1	"Spare yourself from this: Turns out Sheri is the most annoying person ever. And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole ""pushing"" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."
__label__1	Take the time and go to the casses: This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary. Also some of the information in this video is out of date. Go to the classes offered at your hospital. The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees.
__label__2	its great: was helpful, it comes down all the nerves that exist before having the baby, enjoyed, did not get bored, its interesting and you feel like your part of the class. thanks
__label__2	Very informative!: My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting.
__label__2	great alternative to going to a class: My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)
__label__1	Just ok: The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch.
__label__2	Great Video!: I really didn't want to take Lamaze classes, just not my thing. So I researched DVD's and found the Laugh and Learn Series. This is an excellent teaching and exceeded my expectations. Very helpful, detailed and well layed out video. I watched it once and the second time I watched it I took notes. I maye even watch it one more time before my baby is born this July.
__label__2	Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy: Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well.
__label__2	Daughter loved it!: I purchased this for my daughter, expecting her 1st child. She loved it! Tons of information in a FUN way! Very enjoyable and informative.
__label__2	Really Corny but Lots of useful info.: Title about sums it up. If you know diddly squat about your wife being pregnant, worth the watch. Probably could find all the info on Wikipedia or something though. I felt it was worth it.
__label__2	Very educational: This DVD has good information, but the woman is annoying. I think they could have shortened it up a little bit. It is a good alternative to going to a birthing class.
__label__2	Great for 1st Time Parents: My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. We can always refer back to it if we need a refresher course. The breathing technique and education was on point.
__label__2	Worth it: My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. We decided on this one, and although the 'teacher' was a bit corny it was helpful. I especially liked that you could fast forward and skip parts! All in all it was a worthwhile purchase and proved helpful to us both.
__label__1	Take a class: Don't waste your money. If she had been my instructor I would have asked for my money back
__label__2	"Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is ""taught"" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!"
__label__1	Lackluster, Uninformative DVD: The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. The visual aides, diagrams, etc. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner. The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation.
__label__1	There is no laughing in this video...: There's not much learning either. Sheri is incredibly condescending when she mimicks pregnant women. This video could also really use some visual aids besides Sheri holding up a poor illustration, writing lists (that she doesn't finish) on a whiteboard and the worst...her on the ground, legs spread in high-waisted khakis demonstrating childbirth.
__label__1	Because I love condescension: If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it's condescension. I can't stand being talked down to.There are much better videos out there that treat the viewer as if they are an adult.
__label__1	Ruined my life..: I'm an expected father to be, and I thought this DVD would help me show my caring compassionate side... I was trying to be part of the whole child birthing process. Thing is, this DVD provoked an unearthly rage in my spouse. While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information. My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. The information she did give is easily obtainable from a free pamphlet. When I told my spouse I paid $[...] for the movie she freaked! [...]
__label__1	Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!: Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused.
__label__1	The most annyoying childbirth video....ever!!!: You could not pick a more annoying instructor than Sheir Bayles. She absolutely ruins this class. The video quality is horrible as are the 80's rejects posing as her audience. My wife (a physician) and I cringed through the entire presentation.If you buy this video after reading my review, you deserve to lose your money AND be subjected to Sheri Bayles for over 5 grueling hours.
__label__2	Don't go into labour without watching this class!: The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way..
__label__2	A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I bought this DVD trying to avoid taking a Lamaze class and it totally did the trick. I felt better informed and prepared for natural child birth and how to avoid unnecessary interventions. I recommend this for any new or repeat Mommy's.
__label__1	Missing tons of crucial elements: This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge.
__label__1	annoying instructor- waste of time: I wish I could give this video 0 stars. Don't waste your money on this video. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny. She is not funny. The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) Also, the footage appears to be from the mid 1990's- very dated, it's like watching a VHS recording. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this- you'll see.
__label__1	blagh: I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!
__label__2	Lots of Good Information: I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. I am so glad I purchased this video. The price is very good for the information received.Updated 30 Nov 10 :This video was a life saver. The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery. Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative.
__label__2	Excellent: Our baby is here, and the DVDs prepared us very well for what was in store. We knew what questions to ask, and what the nurses/doctors meant when they were using their vernacular thanks to these classes. This is a great substitute for the classes at the hospital because you get the same information at a fraction of the cost.
__label__2	It gets the job done: My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn't have worked. I figured the next best idea (and actually cheaper idea) was to get a DVD we could both watch. Sheri Bayle's attempt at humor is not as good as she would probably have hoped but she is still an informative and relaxing teacher. I would recommend this DVD if you can't attend a class or if you just need to save a little money for all the stuff you will need to buy your new baby!
__label__2	very informative: I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I found this to be just what I needed. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time. I like the fact that I can go back and review parts of it whenever I want. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have.
__label__2	Better than taking a class!: This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!
__label__1	"Annoying and condescending: My husband and I couldn't fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, ""laugh and learn"" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever."
__label__2	She gets funny, annoying... but you learn in the end.: I read other reviews before buying this DVD and I was aware of what to expect. I think you will learn from this DVD everything you need to know for labor. Husbands can also have fun with this video. If you dont mind the jokes and silly faces she makes then buy it. The best part is that you can re play the video again and again.
__label__2	Excellent: I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!
__label__1	Whiny. Annoying. Can't watch. Not funny.: Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch. I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth.
__label__2	Wonderful: This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. I watched this before my son was born, and had a completely natural birth because of it. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital. The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here!
__label__2	Invaluable Resource!: Sherry's a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. We loved this video and learned so much.
__label__2	Fantastic if you can't make a live childbirth class: We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. This DVD was absolutely fantastic for us. It is packed full of useful information and actually quite entertaining. I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class.
__label__2	"could have done without the ""laugh"": very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared ""comedian"" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. it was painful. this made me glad that i didn't attend a childbirth class (and bought this instead).i also could have done without the Viacord plug... it's like a commercial took over the ending of the program to spoil it.all things considered, definitely worth watching."
__label__2	Current and easygoing class on childbirth.: My husband and I decided to buy this when we had to miss the childbirth class we had signed up for at the hospital. It was easy to watch, very informative and we appreciated the up-to-date information on labor and childbirth. I would recommend it to any pregnant women/couples out there looking for a cheaper and more relaxed childbirth class.
__label__2	Better than actual class!: My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. It was very outdated. This DVD was great - very current. Yes, some of her jokes were lame and her attempting to be funny gets a little old, but overall it was really a beneficial DVD. It was nice to be able to do it at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home. I would definitely recommend this DVD to expectant parents rather than taking an actual class.
__label__2	Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule: This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don't have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. We were able to do these classes out of the comfort of our own home, on our time and without the frustration of traffic, etc. Also, the DVD was less money than what the hospital wanted to charge us for enrollment into their classes. The sound fluctuates a bit, but it did not get in the way of our learning experience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone out there!
__label__1	Disappointed: I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price.
__label__2	Good video, not as cheesy as people say: I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be.
__label__2	Verry happy with this video - 1st time mom here: I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. I don't have time to take a class so I bought this video. I am soooo happy I did! I have learned sooo much and feel very confident now about what to expect at the labor. Sherri Bayles is funny and explains things very very well. I highly recommend this video.
__label__2	Very Educational and Informative: My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us. We loved being able to watch this DVD at our leisure in the privacy of our own home. This was one of two DVD's that we purchased and this one was by far the best. Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. I'll certainly keep this one and watch it for subsequent pregnancies.
__label__2	This DVD really helped me: My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. They said it must have been good because I did everything perfectly. I would highly recommend this DVD!
__label__1	Who's laughing?: My husband and I are expecting our first baby any day now. We opted to get a childbirth video versus attending a class. After doing some research and getting reccomendations from friends, I decided to purchase this video. While the information on the DVD is helpful and each segment is clear and easy to understand, the instructor presented it in such a way that made extremely painful to watch.The instructor continuously makes annoying jokes, mocks pregnant women and their partners, using the most unfunny and unflattering impersonations imaginable. Watching this woman's attempt stand-up routine was so uncomfortable that we often found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of it. Please believe that neither me or my husband laughed during this DVD. Not once.I wish we had just gone to childbirth class.
__label__2	Very Helpful...........!: I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.
__label__2	Great Purchase! Worth it!: My husband and I did not want to have to take the time or money to attend an actual birthing class. We decided to purchase this video and we are very pleased with the product. The video goes over everything you will need to know. It is very informative. My husband loves the way that Sheri Bayles teaches about child birth. He thinks she is funny. Defiantly recommend this video.
__label__2	All I needed to know...: I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video.
__label__2	Great knowledge for a new mommy or experienced mother: I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions . This is the best you can get to attending a class yourself. I felt engaged and involved in the class just by watching it on the Television. It covers everything that you need to know about childbirth and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go!
__label__2	"Comprehensive and fun: Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Plus, she is just plain funny. The video is divided into six ""classes"" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting. I highly recommend the set!"
__label__2	Must have!: This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth...your birthing class may not explain things with this much clarity and detail (I know my didn't). I learned a lot about breathing, and controlling your breath, and although I am not planning on using drugs through labor, I thought her section on medical interventions very useful.
__label__2	good information, but...: A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)
__label__1	Rudimentary, though a tad insightful: It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though.
__label__1	Are you kidding me?: First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse.
__label__1	poor choice!: Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear! Look elsewhere for your information and make sure to read Ina mAY gASKIN'S GUIDE TO CHILDBIRTH!
__label__1	Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy: Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
__label__2	Great information: I wasn't able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. I fully intend to use the breathing techniques and I learned a lot of information about labor and delivery. I really like I could go at my own pace and watch and re-watch any parts I needed.
__label__2	Great for calming first child fears: I felt completely in the dark about what to expect when my wife was pregnant.... I like being in control of my situations and knowing the right things to pay attention to, I was concerned about my lack of knowledge especially since we were giving birth in Hong Kong and I was worried about a possible language barrier.This DVD made me a self-proclaimed expert.. I really felt like I knew everything I needed to know and it completely dispelled all my worries.When it came to the big day... despite complications such as water breaking with no signs of labor, introduction of a drug to induce labor, and the ultimate required c-section, I never broke a sweat. I even helped with some decisions, like how long we were going to wait until we gave up on a natural birth. My wife didn't watch this DVD with me, but I was able to comfort her through the whole process by telling her what to expect next.This is an ABSOLUTE no question about it MUST for a new parent-to-be.
__label__2	"BEST Childbirth DVDs ever: These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. Some people criticize that, but I'm quirky...so maybe that's why I like it. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. I'm very much of the mindset that ""if I need meds, I'll scream for them."" From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes. But really, even my husband LOVES watching this DVD!"
__label__2	helpful: This dvd was very helpful before I had my first baby. I wanted to be aware of the different things to do and what my husband should expect and it gave lots of information. loved it!
__label__2	laugh and learn about childbirth: Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
__label__1	not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband: I will give her I did learn something while I wasn't being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. After weeding through, rolling my eyes and totally annoyed by this person, I did find out something. There was NO LAUGHING though. I found her unsympathetic unattached to the really beautiful thing that will be happening when I give birth. Just when I wasn't scared anymore after reading Ina Mae's guide to Childbirth, this woman made me feel aweful about the impending doom that awaits me. I am saposed to be scared and my husband an unhelpful weenie who can't deal, how can this women do this to the world when we've come so far. Unrelaxing and totally neurotic!! A huge waste of money and time. Don't buy it, I wish I hadn't. Really.
__label__1	Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps: me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD.
__label__2	Super Cute Toy: So glad they brought back this classic toy. My 4 year old daughter hasnt put it down. She was so excited to get 4 puppies!!
__label__1	useless: i was very excited when I saw the ad. I planned to buy a few of macro lenses, but ...the macro lens works only for the 1/4 inch distance :-(I cannot scan a business card or an article in a newspaper, but only a few charactersI really need a macro lens but for a few inches distance
__label__1	very bad quality!!!!!: This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!
__label__1	WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL: This film lacks all the elements that make Argento's movies great and fun to watch. There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project.
__label__1	The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!: I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
__label__1	Why an EP release of this film?: While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode.
__label__1	The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!: I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray.
__label__1	Slow and pointless: Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it.
__label__1	"Really, really bad: Argento used to be one of Italy's best film makers, unfortunately with ""Trauma"", this and ""Phantom of the Opera"" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying"
__label__2	Late masterpiece by a brilliant director: The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock. On the one hand it offers you all you ever liked about Argento's flicks: beautiful images, a brilliant soundtrack (this time by Ennio Morricone), ingenious camera working, bloody killings and breathtaking locations. Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro...
__label__1	the worst picture quality i saw since old rental vhs: Previous review is right. Horrible! Nothing else to say about this blu-ray transfert.I cannot even write anything about the movie itself: I have not seen it! Yes after 10 minutes I could not stand such a bad transfert anymore and I stopped watching it!!
__label__1	Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie: Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.
__label__2	The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition): Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her track leads her to the Uffizi museum in Florence. There however, Anna is struck by the Stendhal Syndrome, which makes her faint, when among certain works of art, like paintings and statues. Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario..........
__label__1	Horrible blu-ray transfer!: This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Maybe the worst I've seen so far. I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic. I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative). So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did. Just stick with the DVD. And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann).
__label__1	"Very Bad transfer...: The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more ""transfers"" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma ""studios"" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie? Who knows...you can barely see it. If Troma gets its hands on the great ""Suspiria"" there is no God."
__label__1	DONT BUY TROMA RELEASE: The Troma release is horrible, do not buy it. If you want a good release of this film, buy the Blue Undergroud disc...it is more than worth the extra money.The picture and audio quality on the Troma disc is terrible, and the introduction by Lloyd Kaufman is one of the most annoying things I've ever seen. It's a shame that Troma ever got their hands on such a great film.
__label__2	You will be freaked: This is one of the best Argento Movies ever. The music though simple stays with you. There are few plot holes unlike most Agrento Moives. The ending is a definite twist! I hope Troma releases the UNCUT version of Stendhal Syndrome because there really is no place to cut the movie without losing some of the impact and Plot points
__label__1	Terrible DVD of an impressive film: The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice.
__label__1	Watch out!: I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out. They felt fine but I couldn't even take two (out of three) doses of the pill in one day. This stuff made me feel really nauseas, queezy, and a bit disoriented and restless - which I attribute to the caffeine in this product because I can barely drink one cup of coffee without feeling kind of weird.I never thought diet pills were the solution, and this product just confirms that. I strongly recommend working on the internal issues as to why you can't loose the weight instead of searching for shortcuts.
__label__1	video player: I really wanted to play the bingo game, however, the CD's did not play. I tried to play other games, to no avail.
__label__2	Liked it: I think Izzy is very talented and I'm glad he's using his talent for Kingdom music. I didn't always feel like he gave his all in every song but the lyrics were great and a few songs really caught my ear. I can't say that it's my favorite cd, but I think it's a great way to round out any Christian's cd collection. I hope to see more from this artist.
__label__2	An important addition to the mushroom breeder's library.: This book is oriented toward those interested in developing improved strains of edible mushroom species. Highlighted species include Flammulina velutipes (enokitake), Lentinula edodes (shiitake), Agaricus bisporus (common white button, portabella, crimini), Coprinus cinereus (woolly inky cap) among others. Caution, this is not a how-to-grow book, but a technical reference for breeders. Reviewed by THE MUSHROOM GROWERS' NEWSLETTER, April 1993 issue.
__label__2	Great book for puzzled entrepeneurs!: I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this book was used as our text-book. I found it to be very informative and easy to read. The section concerning Business Plan development was very helpful. I recomend this book to anyone trying to find their way through the myrad of information available when starting a small business. The book is very down to earth, in every chapter there are at least 2 real world examples or case studies for the student to compare to his or own experience
__label__2	Great Buy: This book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Even after paying for express shipping we saved over $120 from the bookstore cost.Thanks Amazon!
__label__1	terrible shipping service: it took a month to get the book in spite of numerous emails and no feedback about the urgency. I finished the summer school without the book.Don't buy anything from this seller.
__label__2	Must read for anyone interested in the A-bomb decision: Mr. Maddox has done a great service in analyzing the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan. He systematically demolishes the arguements used by those who (for whatever reason) think that the bombing was unjustified. He shows through intercepted transmissions how the Japanese were ready to commit themselves to a bloodbath to fight off an invasion and how the Japanese military still wanted to fight even after Hiroshima was destroyed. Overall, the book is great work and should be required reading in schools and the Smithsonian Museum.
__label__1	Disappointed: I bought this book, because I thought I will get some new insights on the big money lotteries, but I do not think there is anything of value there. I have the older book of Gail Howard; used to play Fantasy 5; 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 are the highest prizes I have ever won. Do not get caught by the hype: This book won't tell you how to win the big money lotteries - in fact, all that Gail Howard says is that it's very difficult to predict the Powerball ball, and the Powerball ball cannot be wheeled anyway. Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere. The book has a very long section (some 20+ pages) of ads about Howard's other books and software. Hey, you pay for that too! You'd be better off spending your $$ on a couple of extra tickets...
__label__1	Nothing New: This is nothing new from Gail Howard, or at all. These wheeling systems can be worked out mathematically, without paying for this book. There are also lots of websites that offer number generators and wheeling system explanations for free. If you want it all spelled out for you then buy this book, but if you are willing to do a little mathematical work check out lottery information website like [...].
__label__1	Not Very Useful Unless You Can Afford to Spend A Lot of Money, Buying a Lot of Tickets Per Game...: I found her concept very, VERY good, BUT, unless you're really flush and can afford to spend a great deal of money for a LOT of number combinations per game, it certainly doesn't increase your odds much. Now... there ARE folks who can afford, and DO buy, many ticket combinations per game... so for THEM this may be helpful; however, for the average person who buys only a few number combinations each game, this is a waste of time. Sorry Gail :o( !!
__label__1	Waste oF $MONEY$: Waste Of Time & Money... I found that if you want to win big, just put the money into a savings account & watch your money grow! Pay YOURSELF not this author.
__label__1	The odds are against you not for you.: Winning is pure luck. There is no amount of strategy unless you are already rich. And believe it or not rich people play too. They can buy 100 tickets week. I cannot. But in reality it only takes ONE set of numbers to win anyway.Gail conviently leaves out this one very fact. 71% of winners are quick picks. The rest here and there over the years have been their own numbers. You cannot predict the powerball.The book has good ideas but how many people have won by using some kind of random system? I doubt any. It is all luck, pure and simple.
__label__1	Incorrect Product Information: The actual model of this meter is the i410, I am unsure where the number 617727 is relevant as Fluke doesn't identify it with this number. I suspect this is a component of some kit, which is defunct and therefore the reason for the strange model number. There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns. If someone purchased this and did not return it, maybe AMAZON did not look at the listing.I suggest those looking for a current probe visit the link in this review and proceed from there. The review is for the improper listing.
__label__1	DO NOT AGREE: THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE Fluke 617727 Clamp-on Current Probe INDICATES CLEAR GOOD THAT: Fluke Clamp-on Current Probe is to 1000 amp AC/DC current clamp for ideal DMMs and is the digital tool to extend the current ranges of multimeters. THEY SENT ME THE MODEL I410 WHO IS GIVES 400 AMP OF RANGE, NOT THE ONE THAT BUYS THAT SUPPOSEDLY IT(HE,SHE) IS GIVES 1000 AMP OF RANGE, I FEEL DEFRAUDED BECAUSE I PAID FOR A Clamp-on Current Probe GIVE MORE CAPACITY AND THEY GAVE TO ME ONE OF MINOR CAPACITY.
__label__1	Misguided and unclear product info: I bought this clamp and it turns out I need digital multimeter to operate it. I do not understand DMMs means before . After i received it and read the intruction then I understood. I wished that the ad could be more clearer. I have not returned it yet because it cost money to send it back.Any suggestion ? Mean a while I already bought another fluke amp meter that does not need another digital meter to operate it.
__label__1	wrong amp rating on website: The Fluke current clamp works properly but the Amazon website listed the device as having 1000amp capacity. Actual specification is only 400 amps. Since I'm monitoring an 800 amp, AC service it's not too helpful. Please fix the website. Product description as of 05/06/12 says 1000amp AC/DC.In the technical details it would be very, very helpful if you would attach pdf's of the manuals and spec sheets.
__label__1	Might as well buy it at the apple website: It's $39.00 on the apple website, there is free shipping as well, so why buy it on amazon? I came here looking for a deal and was disappointed.
__label__2	Apple travel plugs well made: I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need.
__label__2	Flawless: Worked like a charm all over England. I haven't tried the other adaptors, but I found my MacBook to work just like it does here in the US, and there was no difficulty plugging into the outlets.
__label__1	"I don't get it: Why does everyone rave about this? One of the reviews even says, ""If you need this then get it."" Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."
__label__1	"This is a Joke: When travelling I seek to minimise the weight and number of items I bring. Technology is one good place where gains on this front can be made. This product bundle is a complete joke. Why so many pieces? Why bring all of that excess stuff? If the answer is ""just take the ones you will need for a given trip"" then why not just buy some cheapo country/ region specific solution? If you are serious about travel with your electronics (not just Apple) check out this:Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter. It has covered me in Asia, Australia, and Europe and there is only one piece to deal with."
__label__2	Hail Mary!: This album is truely amazing. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are funny yet full of truth, and her voice is awsome. The songs are full of crude humor as she talks extensively about drinking and sex. Somehow though, even a more conservative girl like me can grow to loooove her music. The reason is because of how deep her lyrics can be, even though, at a first lisen, it might not appear that way. Her songs can range from very funny like, The World is Full of Bastards, which almost any girl can relate to, and guys laugh about, and Mata Hari, about a fake and slutty girl to more somber like Takes His Place, about relationships never working out. Her songs speak to everyone as she speaks about messing up in life and about bad relationships. Everyone needs to get this cd, support lil local bands...also see her in concert, that is the most amazing experience!
__label__2	More dirty lyrics....but it's great!: Mary Prankster may offend the meek...but they can go elsewhere, 'cause Mary scores another hit. It's great!
__label__2	roulette girl: After listening to Mary's first release, Blue Skies Over Dundalk, I thought it couldn't get any better than that. Well, Mary has proven me wrong. Roulette Girl is a half hour of deeply emotional yet still witty songs. Anyone with a pulse should own this album.
__label__1	Size way too big: This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping.
__label__2	Newman is a musician worth listening to.: As a sensitive person with eclectic tastes it's easy to be impressed by Animal Dreams. It's full of original, creative surprises that restore faith in the existence of musicians courageous enough to speak with their own voice, from something deeper and broader than a desire for popularity. You can't find this CD at the music store nearest you but fortunately it's available here. I recommend Animal Dreams and Ron Newman as a musician worth listening to.
__label__1	single song makes it worth it: Almond sings off-key, but that is a longstanding trademark , and, oddly, creates a weird appeal regarding his singing style. The songs however are a combination of irritating and boring, with the notable exception of his duet with Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. Their mutual effort is a winner and, if unavailable on other discs, makes this disc worth having.
__label__2	Very Helpfull: Excellent little book, specially for some of as, that came to this country a bit later in life, and need it to learn the language just like everyone that comes here.
__label__2	Good: Remembering my school and college days. reminds the grammar lessons and explaining the rudimentary parts of speech noun, verb, pronoun, adjective, adverb
__label__2	Great Book!: Great book for people that need to write email. It would be nice to review the grammar rule's from time to time.
__label__2	A very clear picture of the English language: I enjoyed reading this and brushing up on my grammar. I thing I whould have done better at school if I had this then.
__label__1	"Old and free is no way to sell your books, son.: If you need a grammar reference, this may well serve until you find a better one. It might be of greater utility if the tone wasn't vaguely condescending and pedantic, and it eschews the panoply of actual examples in favor of definitions. To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of ""to love"" results in ""If you have been loved..."" gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate ""falar"" and need to know which one to use.--#"
__label__2	Beautiful Hard Cover: Very Slick Looking Book - Perfect Condition and Glossy Looking - Looking forward to reading it :)
__label__1	"If the title is incorrect...: If you REALLY want to write correct, you won't write ""correctly."" Yes, it's in common use but it is, by the rules of grammar, incorrect. It's an overcorrection, an unnecessary addition. Here's a simple rule of thumb: Substitute the word ""fast"" where you're thinking of adding an -ly. Would you say ""How to Speak and Write Fastly?"" No. Same part of speech, but it somehow escaped that stupid -ly trap."
__label__2	Effective: I found the information timeless. Yes, somethings sounded dated because of time. Yet it did not take away from the content.
__label__2	Very helpful!!: Very nice book! I am very happy with all the information on this book. It explains a lot of english grammar!
__label__2	Excellent Work: Great book. Really helpful and easy to follow. I know it will come in handy because I am not the best at speaking or writing.Thank you!
__label__1	Too Much Info: This book should have been written more as a novel than a how to. This book goes into story like dimensions and there are others better written on the subject.
__label__1	This is a gem, for a CERTAIN KIND of reader: If you know it all already, this is a good book for you to buy. If you are looking for grammar instruction, look elsewhere. This little book was written 75 years ago and it has things worth thinking about, but it is not a grammar book, or a book on speaking, or a book on writing. I just bought it and am delighted to rummage about in it. It's a GEM. It's worth the money by a mile and a half. I gave it two stars only to not be lost in the shuffle. Buyers often don't look at 50 rave shill reviews but they'll look to see who doesn't like and why. So maybe I caught some readers. This is a good buy IF you KNOW IT ALL. It's not instruction, it's food for thought.
__label__1	"This book is awful. Give it a miss.: Even for the free Kindle version, I found myself thinking, ""I want my money back!""This book is a laundry list of rules and regulations of writing, grammar and style that are incredibly outdated. And how can you trust a language coach who, in his effort to teach us to write clearly and using simple words, writes, ""This book has no pretension about it whatever, -- it is neither a Manual of Rhetoric, expatiating on the dogmas of style...""Expatiating, indeed. lolThere are countless books out there that will help you improve your writing and knowledge of the English language. This definitely isn't one of them!"
__label__1	no dice: This is a book that serves no purpose i would not read again it does not do wat the title says it is
__label__2	books: free from amazon, downloaded the free kindle app for a new android phone and was trying it out, have not read the book yet but the pages and quality look good.
__label__2	Smooth Feel but costly: I loved the product, but when I went back to get another bottle, I discovered it had nearly doubled in price....so no thanks...I'll find something else.
__label__1	I have not received the item: I have not received the item that I bought. I amjust waiting for some extra days in order to send a claim or a complain.Rgrds,Xavier Arderiu
__label__2	Good raw thrash...: I've never been a huge fan of Voivod, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Very raw and over-the-top, with raspy vocals and plenty of energy. I'll definitely be checking out some of their other stuff as well, as this one is really growing on me...
__label__2	"NUCLEAR WAR!: A must-have for any fan of Thrash Metal. Blacky's meat-grinding bass sound and Snake's Venom-like vocals will make you wish you were born a Voivodian. However, the production sounds somewhat inadequate. Having seen Voivod live this past summer perform two of these tracks (""Nuclear War"" and ""Voivod""), I thought they sounded MUCH better in concert than on the album. Still, it's WAR & PAIN!"
__label__2	pure hardcore thrash: If you want a pure hardcore 80's thrash sound then this cd is for you.It sound like they locked the producer out of the studio and then recorded. It's pure, raw, agressive and (for the time when it came out) nasty.The fore-runners of the 80's thrash scean. Taking the best from both the thrash and punk genra. Unfortunate for all that they didn't recieve the recomendation that they deserved.
__label__2	Fabulous!!: I think this album is brilliant--awesome music!! Can't turn it off!!! Especially love Allegratango!!! Adiemus could sing to the sound of a washing machine and still sound good! Kudos!!!
__label__2	Masterpiece.: Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection.
__label__2	"Not as good as ""What burns never returns""...: ...but a very good pick anyway! As usual Don Caballero manage to hover miles above the average indie-record. This time tough the music is less aggressive, the drumming less furious and the pace is overall calmer. Don't get me wrong, they haven't limped, they still spark with energy and creativity, only the've become more ""mature"". For those who don't know anything about the band I'll just say that they find themselves between shellac and tortoise, between arty improvisation (which most people call post-rock) and noise-rock."
__label__1	"Two Words: Terrible ""Author"": Great book if you want to read the self-indulgent ramblings of delusional, holier-than-thou person with an 80 at best IQ. NOT recommended."
__label__2	Great Band Info: I was born in 67. So I have always enjoyed 70 s music but found alot of great music from the 60's about 5 years ago. I play guitar and that always gave me reasons to learn more.
__label__2	Story of The YARDBIRDS: Excellant DVD. Had a lot of info I didn't know about the band. Highly recommended.
__label__2	Usher: OMG Tour Live From London [Blu-ray]: The DVD was amazing.. My whole family watched, we love Usher..This was better than going..I could see his every move.Thank you Amazon you make shopping easy..
__label__2	If you love Usher, you want!: I wasn't totally in love with the show, but I'm an Usher fan. I feel like the Los Angeles show would have been more banging! I've been dying for Usher to release some sort of concert on Blu-ray. Really wish Confessions or 8701 would get put on Blu-ray. If you are a real Usher fan, this is a must have!
__label__1	Terrible: I bought thnking was another artist, but anyway when I watch it , how bad this guy sing, very bad, no voice, it is terrible show, terrible sound. Not worth it at all
__label__2	Usher's Concert: If you a fan of Usher this blue ray concert is a must have. The quality and his performances are very good.
__label__2	Frasier: A great DVD by Usher; I love his music. The perfromances are great and the songs make you want watch the DVD over and over again. I recommend that you buy this one.
__label__2	An 80's classic!: I don't know what it is about this movie but it's a classic 80's flick! Mark Harmon is at his best. The plot is a little predictable but it's entertaining and takes you back to the decade past.
__label__1	Not good, not bad: If you like early Mark Harmon, then it is worth the time. Otherwise, it is a made for TV style situation comedy. There are some embarrassing moments and a heart-warming ending.
__label__2	A great and fun romantic comedy that is not very well known: This is an old school comedy and it is not very well known, but it is a real cute and funny movie, with some wonderful actors doing a great job, a great storyline, and for all the guys some really pretty girls! ;) It is a really great romantic comedy that I highly recomend to anyone who likes this genre!! Out of 5 stars I give it 4 and 1/2.
__label__1	Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete: I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.
__label__1	Looks like it was Printed on a cheap broken down Printer: Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
__label__2	Great for kids who like to work with their hands...: This kept my grandson busy for a long time and they are very durable. He made many different things with them.
__label__1	What ever happened to Barbara Crampton?: In Movieland, some people are just born for certain parts. This was a Jeffrey Combs/Barbara Crampton movie if there ever was one. All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time. Oh, and Joe Estavez...Talk about unintentionally hilarious!!!.
__label__2	One of the best....: What a rib tickler this film is...I've seen it twice and know that twice more at least is on the cards. Of course, I love Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu, so to have them together is pure heaven! For a quite amazing contrast, check out 36 Quai des Orfèvres, a violent police/crime drama also starring both actors. Whether you speak French or not, you can tell these guys aren't just playing themselves...they are both excellent actors. See these films if you're a real, dyed-in-the-wool film buff!
__label__1	Fourth order of the same movie.: I have ordered this DVD four times. Picture is fine, music is fine, subtitles are fine BUT none of the received DVD has french dialogs/ actors' voices. Does somebody else have the same experience??Steve
__label__1	Offensive: This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen. Don't let the title or the box fool you. Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment. I was shocked that such a film could come out of France. If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.HIDEOUS!
__label__1	Nothing to Write Home About: Nice in theory, but doesn't really do the trick. We thought the longer shaft and small profile would make it easy to hold it in the right spot during intercourse to give me the extra zing necessary. The problem is, the surface is difficult to press up against the right spot. If the paddle had a nub on it or it was convex would make it a lot better.I was also disappointed in the speed/strength. In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase. The strength is a little much to start off, and usually not enough after a short while. It would be nice if the power were adjustable.Positive: Very easy to clean - waterproof - inexpensive - slender design makes it easy to bring with you anywhere.
__label__2	A book by an outstanding mentor: Dr. Jeanne Shaw is an outstanding mentor and guide in the area of human relations and relationships, as reflected in her handbooks. From her decades of experience of counseling individuals and couples come the vital lessons that she has compacted into this handbook.I have learned so much not only about relationships, but about life and living from Dr. Shaw, that I remain eternally indebted to her.
__label__2	xinhua dictionary chinese / english translation: i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book.
__label__2	Life Drawing: Techniques in Action: I teach Figure Drawing and I am using some of the exercises with my class. They love the new way of thinking. Guessing measurements has really helped.
__label__2	Why is Amazon still out of stock? This is a great item?: I liked Ms Woods book on life drawing (which I bought through Amazon) so when I saw a DVD also listed, I was interested. Amazon listed it out of stock, but I managed to find a copy. I am amazed to see months later that you still show it out of stock. It is an excellent DVD. I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point. I found many of her 'lessons' helpful and would think many Amazon clients would agree. Incidentally, her book that piqued my interest wasLife Drawing: A Journey to Self-Expression
__label__2	Excellent Product, Fast Shipping: Scott's Cakes contacted me after receiving my previous order. Representative was pleasant, and wanted to know how they could improve. They did what was recommended and my next shipment came on time and without melted chocolate!!!Thank you Scott's Cakes for providing my family with delicious products and excellent customer service!!!
__label__1	Foam Ripoff: The most uncomfortable, overpriced piece of foam on the market. Also beware that there is a 10 day return policy on this piece of junk.
__label__2	It really helped me: I had very bad hoarseness from acid reflux. Prescription medicine wasn't helping. My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux.
__label__2	Eliminated my acid reflux: My acid reflux started a year ago. Whenever I lied down, my esophagus would start hurting within minutes. I tried just about all of the various acid reducing pills, both prescription and non-prescription as well as many natural remedies, with limited effect. I still woke up every hour or two at night and had to chew antacids to be able to sleep the next hour.After using this pillow for a few days my acid reflux pain disappeared and I don't need medication anymore. I place the back support pillow along the lower edge of the wedge pillow, inside the pillowcase, to elevate my rib cage. I use the neck support pillow together with a regular pillow, inside a pillowcase, to support my neck. I try to sleep as much as possible on my left side, although after a couple of weeks there was no discomfort sleeping either on my back or on my right side.
__label__2	Clan of the Cave Bear: I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla.
__label__2	A really good book: Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone.
__label__2	It's a good book: This is the first in a series of very good books following the life of a prehistoric woman. She uses creativity intelligence to live in a difficult environment.
__label__1	Typos abound: I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will.
__label__2	I'm going nuts!: PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!
__label__2	Well researched, educational, and realistic!: An inspiring depiction of a woman. I received this from my mother in Junior High School, I only read this recently. I wish I had read it sooner. I have sent this series to all my friends. I can't wait for the next book!
__label__2	Enthralling: I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow
__label__1	Tedious: This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended.
__label__1	Prehistory - Schmistory: Intellectually and artistically roughly on a par with the Flintstones. Despite the numerous five star reviews it has received here this risible prehistoric bonkbuster is utter dross, a hopelessly 'eighties modernist' take on the past diplaying minimal knowledge of human nature and the way new ideas and societies really evolve.Of course good fairy tales can be entertaining for children and adults alike and are an esential part of our cultural heritage. Not this one though
__label__1	Great Title Not a great narrator: I found Sandra Burr choppy and irritating to listen to. Her voice was not what I expected. There is another version of this book narrated by another woman whose voice is smooth, and can put you to bed. Yet she tells the tale with enough excitement and with different tones for each character that you are compelled to listen ALL DAY!The plot is wonderful, though if you want to listen instead of read, I don't reccomend the Sandra Burr narration. I reccomend the one read by Rowena Cooper. AMAZING!
__label__1	"Failed attempt at female empowerment: The basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical (or pre-historical?) fiction. However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal ""mind meld"" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."
__label__1	Don't bother reading the book: I was recommended this book by a family member. I'm going to be honest, this book is really bad. The main character is a Mary Sue type character (she can do everything perfectly, tame horses, etc) and it's like a Harliquin romance novel - because there's so much sex in it. This book was a complete waste of time.
__label__1	really really bad: i find it incredible that so many people speak so glowingly of this book. on the basis of its literary merit it deserves a prominent spot in supermarket checkout lanes. that this is in any way respected as a novel or thought of as remotely historical (pre-historical, is suppose) speaks sad volumes about our society.i guess my one star may be a bit harsh. it's concievable that one could glean some amusement or light entertainment from this. but i feel a civic duty to in bring down the five star average it's garnered so far.
__label__2	Not the same as pitchure: The book dose the job as far as that goes and it is a used book but I was expecting a newer book going by the pitchure
__label__1	I read almost 5 pages!: An earthquake opens a crack in the earth, the parents fall in, and it slams shut!?!?!? That's the best Auel could do? Has that EVER happened in history to ANYONE?I read that and threw the book in the trash. And it wasn't even my copy!
__label__2	Best book ever: This first book in my 62 years that has make me laugh & cry. It is an amazing story of a young women who suffering made her stronger to survive & to love unconditionally.
__label__2	Good re-read!: So happy to find this book. I read the series several years ago and shall start them over this winter. Sent quickly & in good shape. Recommend this seller to all.
__label__2	awesome reading: This book is the start of an incredible journey. It gives an insight to our origins in such a way that you can no longer doubt ourroots. Ayla is the epitome of all of us!
__label__2	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I started reading Jean Auel's Earth Children series many years ago. I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive.
__label__2	The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear.: I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
__label__2	Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel: I have read this book a few times since it came out. It had to be replaced because it was faling apart and I could not find anyone to repair it. Looking forward to getting the last book in the series in hardback.
__label__2	such an intriguing idea: actually, an intriguing and literally epic idea. especially when I first read it, years ago, the idea of a female protagonist being the central figure not only of the story but of this stage in human, earthly development, was absolutely unique. I still find it so (I reread it)...
__label__2	A Fantastic Read: I love to read, and I especially love to see a movie for the first time and find out that it was inspired by a novel. The Clan of the Cave Bear movie was good, but the book is amazing. Jean M. Auel tells an engaging story. Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep. I try to reread it at least once a year. If you like books that grab your attention and then refuse to let go-This is the book for you.
__label__2	Finding a Treasure: Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!
__label__2	"You will FALL IN LOVE with Auel's Ayla!!: You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously ""too perfect"" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."
__label__2	"Clan of the Cave Bear: This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the ""Others"", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"
__label__2	Very well researched and written.: Reading this book was an emotional experience. The author was able to describe scenes so accurate that I actually felt as if I were that little 5 year old girl, lost in the wilderness, hungry, cold, tired, delusional, and frightened. I was captivated with this series and reread all four books five times already. I've learned more about survival from this book than I have from 12 years in our public school systems. Great job. When's the wedding going to be written?
__label__2	very exiting series: I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????
__label__2	A wonderful story of early man.: I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
__label__2	The best series of books out there: This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time.
__label__2	Great Story - You will enjoy it.: This was a great book. Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today. As well as enjoying the story and learning about primative times you will also be thinking about how this can relate to today... Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read..
__label__2	VERY GOOD, I WAS IMPRESSED AND WILL READ MORE: I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?
__label__1	Prehistorical Meandering Story: The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else.
__label__2	Magnificently compelling...: This is a wonderfully entertaining, well-written and thought provoking story. The author did a superb job of developing character and plot, leaving the reader with a lust for the story to continue.
__label__1	"Amature.: I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
__label__2	clan of the cave bear: this book opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. she showed rational method as to how many discoveries could have come about. riding a horse for the first time must have been a true sight, it is taken for granted by us today but can you inagine what it must have been like to wittnes this for the first time. i have read all her books several times and been just as awe struck by every one.
__label__2	This is an amazing book.: This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran
__label__2	A Scientific Saga: I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga.
__label__1	"Oh, puhleeeeaze!: I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
__label__1	Compelling story but reads like a textbook: The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end.
__label__2	"First in the series ..: This, the first book in the series of ""Earth's Children"" is a gripping, fascinating introduction to the first of our thinking ancestors. Almost as if we were there."
__label__2	a wonderful epic: This is one long story that really takes you into the depth of prehistoric times and rituals. It's wonderfully researched and finely detailed. I read with wonder all the recipes for medicine. What herb cured or maintained certain diseases. The movie does this book absolutely no justice. What was Darrel Hannah thinking when she signed up for that bomb? This book takes a look at human relations and the beginnings of communication. A great read.
__label__1	Not My Cup of Tea: I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for.
__label__2	A moving book about the endurance of humanity: I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results.
__label__2	HOURS OF GREAT READING......: I have the entire collection of Jean Auel's Children of the Earth series, and reread them over and over. Great books!
__label__1	Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read.
__label__2	A Must Read For Ice Age Purists!!!: Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
__label__2	Added to my collection: I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection. It turned out to be a book club size and I traded it to a friend for the full size version.
__label__2	I loved it.: I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change. She makes the characters real, you can sense and identify with their emotions. Hurry with that next book
__label__2	original, and discriptive, Jean displays her imagination on: paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%
__label__2	I really enjoy the series.: Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book.
__label__2	Not the best of her books but still high quality...: The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to.
__label__2	The clan Of the cave bear is a good book: It has an interesting plot and alot of great information. I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it
__label__1	I really tried to like it: My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half. Really not very interesting. For whatever reason, women seem to find this book interesting. I have other male friends that have had the same experience. For me, nothing that grabbed my attention happened and the writing wasn't enough to make up for it.
__label__2	"5+ stars. LO MEJOR DE LO QUE HE LEIDO EN MI VIDA.: Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.Un libro para leer y releer, es como un libro de superación personal, pero sin los aburridos consejos sabiondos de los autores, ni las falsas promesas de los nuevos autores llamados ""new age"". DEBE LEERLO, Y POR FAVOR, NO LO PRESTE.....!El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS.El libro de los viajes (""Plains""): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN ""cazadores"", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....""The Shelter of stone""...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."
__label__1	"way too much: I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a ""must read"" for women as young as 10!"
__label__1	Its really just a harlequin novel: If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc.
__label__2	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I really loved this book and the books that follow this one, but I didn't really like the way the people's feelings are. I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do. Though the parts that confused me were the mogur ceremony and the earthquakes. Because in a way it makes it seem as if all the magic is real.
__label__2	to much detail: Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details. But I guess that makes for a good book writer.
__label__1	No plot, No Characters: One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them. Why the author felt she had to abandon any attempt at subtlety, and write as if the readers were as ignorant as her characters seem to be is beyond me.
__label__2	Great. Really Great.: I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces.
__label__1	Boring: Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.
__label__2	The Clan of the Cave Bear: Several times over the years I've tried to read this..but every time it just didnt catch my interest enough....still,i was pretty sure at some point it Might be worth trying again..... So after many years i finally downloaded it to kindle and wow, it was terrific... Now i'm hooked on reading the entire series. Try it, YOU might love it too!
__label__2	Interesting: Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.
__label__2	An exquisitely written adventure!: I have read these books to the point of wearing out my paperbacks. Ayla is the role model I never had as a young girl and sets a high standard for all of us to attain. I was completely transported to a different place and time while I read each story and felt drawn toward these marvelously written characters. I am so anxious for Ms. Auel's next creation I cannot pass a bookstore, anywhere, without checking to see if it's in yet. Please hurry, Jean!
__label__2	"A little much for a 14 year old: Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the ""clans"" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"
__label__2	Very good reading.: I loved all three books. I had read the Shelters of Stone first as it was a gift, but thoroughly enjoyed going back to see where it all began. Amazing author.
__label__2	2nd time around: This is the second time I am ready this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first read them. The main Character Ayla is wonderful and you become very attached to her from the time you meet her at age 5 through her life. You root for her and cry for her. I can wait to start book 2,3,4,....until the last book which recently came out in 2012.Well worth the 500+ pages
__label__2	Clan of the Cave Bear, a true classic: Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before.
__label__2	First in the series. Great read.: If you enjoy anthropology, archeaology, and learning about the first of mankind on our planet, then you will find this entire series plausibe, and very enjoyable reading. This is a series of books that completely holds your attention through every page. Every book is based on thorough research of ancient sites, tools, and other findings that tell us about the people of yesteryear and how they survived the glacier period. The characters are so well presented that they seem real. Each additional novel is a continual saga from the prior book, so continuity flows very well.
__label__2	Great story, excellent insight into prehistoric man: While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)
__label__2	Cave of the Clan Bear: Cave of the Clan Bear is well written. It moves quickly. The descriptions of the venue are detailed enough to draw the reader into the scene and the little girl's trials are believable.
__label__1	I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But...: I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening.
__label__1	Kindle's edition is full of typos: The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books.
__label__1	"Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.: Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
__label__2	"This series is a ""keeper"": Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."
__label__2	"Great Book: Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, ""Clan of the Cave Bear "" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get."
__label__1	amazing: it amazes me that after so many years and so much exposure that this book is still in print. the only story i have ever read that is worse than these is Moby Dick. the only thing worse than those 2 books are the movie adaptations. i'd rather pull out my own fingernails with red hot pliers than to read the cave bear again. a insanely long and over written pile of trite tripe.'a festering bag of fish entrails' is too kind a review for this load of sewage. if anyone tries to make you read this book, slit your wrists and fling yourselve from a cliff first - it will be less painfull.
__label__2	"The Clan Of The Cave Bear, and the other books were great.: In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her ""tribe"" gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book! Even though I started the series when I was in the sixth grade, last year, I love this series, and have already finished it. I'm dying to read the next one."
__label__2	Great Read: I am currently still reading this book. I'm having a great time reading it and I love how every scene is so perfectly described and full of details.It's one of those books that you have to stop reading now and then, so that you can let your imagination fly and Imagine how would you survive in such conditions and time period.Simply fantastic.
__label__2	"BEST of the series...unfortunately: This is the first book in the ""earth's children"" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"
__label__2	So Much Detail that the Story Come to Life: I read this book a few years back but couldn't resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account.Jean Auel is one of my favorite authors. I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!
__label__2	Clan of the Cave Bear, good read.: This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times. It is a fiction for both sexes, as both my son and daughter loved reading and listening to the audio cd's.
__label__2	A fascinating tale: This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older.
__label__2	I fell in love with this book from the first page......: TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it.
__label__2	"Prehistoric Research Fiction?: I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (""the clan"") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."
__label__2	"YOU MADE ME FEEL I WAS AYLA!: WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT? THERE HAS TO BE A #5. I WILL READ EVERY BOOK YOU WRITE IF THEY ARE LIKE THE ""AYLA"" JOURNEY."
__label__1	Tripe, and not very good tripe at that: lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash.
__label__1	"Neanderthal Sexists: This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters ""made the sign"" indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs."
__label__1	Horrid!: I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time.
__label__2	Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. I would purchase a used book again from this source.
__label__2	One of the best books I have ever read: I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels.
__label__2	Sensational.: I enjoyed this book a lot. It was difficult for me to put it down at times. The end of the book leaves you captivated. It makes you want to start the next book in the series as soon as possible.
__label__2	Beautiful!!: I was hooked from the first page!! This is the best book ever written! If you have read this book, read the others, they keep getting better!! When is the next book coming out?
__label__2	there's nothing better than this: I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new book to read. When I found my mom's old tattered copy of Clan of the Cave Bears, I didn't expect much. Oh my goodness, though, Auel is a virtuoso. I cannot wait for the next one!
__label__2	EXCELENT!!!: It's just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. These series have given to humanity a great gift. Thanks a lot Ms. Auel. I hope you will continue the Ayla's story. I've been waiting for years to continue the story, I'm sure you have too much to write. When the next book will be coming out?. Every time I go to a bookstore I look for the next one.
__label__2	Cave Woman: I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE.
__label__2	Very Good, But Not For Immature Children: This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book.
__label__2	Totally addictive: Loving this series. Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more
__label__2	Read this book and get hooked on the entire series!: A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family. She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M. Auel series.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child
__label__2	Fascinating!: I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself.
__label__2	AMAZING series: I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay.
__label__2	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book.
__label__2	Simply Fantastic!: It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)
__label__2	This is one of the most beautiful books I've read.: What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end
__label__2	My thoughts: I read the book many years ago, and decided to reread due to liking the book so well and when I am finished, my granddaughter will read
__label__2	Enchanting and Creative: I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
__label__2	Highly recommended to me, and I agree: On a number of occasions, it had been suggested that I read this book, and I must say I'm very glad I did. I got very involved, as the writing was so wonderfully descriptive. Having said this, I don't think it was arduous to read all that detail, which sometimes makes reading a book feel a bit of a chore. I would recommend it to anyone!
__label__2	What I expected: Friend told me about the book , have not started to read it yet. Hope it is as good as she said.
__label__2	Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation: Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
__label__2	"brief overview: This is not a book, its a pamphlet that gives a very terse overview of the PL/I language. Its not a beginners book but a primer for experienced programmers. The only current book on PL/I is ""The New PL/I"" by Eberhard Sturm which is already out of print after being out less than 2 years"
__label__2	for beginners: This is a very good book for the beginners to gain a overall knowledge of PL/1 and start making small programs.
__label__2	Nice for NYG Fans!: Very nice Floor Mats. Bought these for my Honda Civic and they work great. Super deal. Shipping was very fast and they were exactly as I expected. A little small so they should fit just about all vehicles. Might be too small for large trucks.
__label__1	Very bad logo!! You cant see it.: the shipping was fast, as usual by Amazon. The product is terrible, you can barely see the logo, its not a real Colts blue, more of a very dark navy almost purple color. They will be going back. I should have known the price was too good to be true for a product of any real value.
__label__1	"trouble with car not matts: Matt on driver side slides forward and I have not found a way to anchor it. It would be better if the Broncos had gone to the Super Bowl in 2013. The ""Prayer in thin Air"" did them in or was it ""The kneel down in D Town?"""
__label__2	Smooth, great color, and good price: I happened upon this product at Nordstrom's Rack and picked up one. Boy did I wish I had grabbed a handful. I have been buying Origin's automatic lip liner for about $22.00 a pop and these are just as good, if not better. On a lark I searched Amazon to see if they had them. Yep! I use the Black Berry as I like to wear dark and wine colored lipsticks. I am going to grab a handful this time. The liner goes on easily and keeps my lipstick in place. Makes a nice frame for the lipstick.
__label__1	"Bless her heart for writing this: This book is the worst! It is more like a journal than advice on how to deal with a child with SID. No reference is made as to what works and what doesn't. Mrs. Wilson uses this as a forum to slam her son's teachers and class mates. She even refers to a 2nd grader as the ""son of Satan""- Nice and very Christian of you....It appears that Mrs. Wilson thinks she's doing something benefical for others but don't waste your money here. If you are looking for a book to help you cope with your child's SID this is not it."
__label__2	Fun Read!: This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!
__label__2	Pictures!: I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
__label__2	Very dated: If you love Dear Abby, you'll love this book. It is very dated however. She had quite a sense of humor and it is evident in this book. A mindless, time passing read.
__label__2	Lots of fun for Dear Abbey lovers: This book was great! Lots of old Dear Abbey letters with background information on the thoughts that were behind the answers.
__label__2	Excellent reference guide: I work at a Wild Birds Unlimited store and customers rely on you to give them the best information on bird feeding and care available. This book is super helpful in achieving that goal.
__label__2	"Will take a 15.5"" laptop: I have an XPS GEN 2 Inspiron which is 15.5"" long. I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5"" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16"" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack."
__label__1	poor quality backpack, don't buy...: I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!
__label__1	Mind boggling design flaws: I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs, and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.
__label__2	"Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!: Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
__label__2	Another reason to suscribe to Prime: This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn't suscribed to Amazon Prime. I'm not getting any perks, etc, for reccomending Amazon Prime, but one of the features is the instant video. While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good. I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein ofThe Descendants.
__label__2	Gripping Film: Very good acting. Very emotional. I empathized with every character! I was very impressed with the the actors and writers, who weaved the story in a way that we were kept on edge wondering with the characters, what was going on.
__label__2	great story, well directed, fine acting: This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!
__label__2	Captivating, Engaging, Wonderful: Completely captivating and amazing. When I saw the movie I knew nothing about it and I am glad otherwise the plot would have been ruined. So, I won't say anything about the plot.This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.The DVD has very few Special Features. But, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are preceded by an interview with the director explaining why each of them was cut out of the film.
__label__2	What A Story!!!: It fires on all engines and pulls you right in!Compassionate, heart-wrenching, happy and sad at once, this incredible story will resound within long after the credits roll by at the end.It's keenly raw, honest, and emotionally intense.
__label__2	If only Hollywood could offer something this good: I saw the previews for this movie while waiting for my main feature it seemed interesting so I remembered the title and I am so glad I did. Excellent story, excellent acting without it be overdramatized. I will add this to my collection.
__label__2	review: don't let the bad cover art fool you. I saw this in the theaters and bought it immediately when it came out on DVD. A powerful film. To say any more to be to give it away.
__label__2	Worthy of Several Academy Nominations: Director Susanne Bier, Best Screenplay writers Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, Best Actor Rolf Lassgrd, Best Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, and a few other supporting and camera work nominations would not surprise me. I will be disappointed if they are not rewarded for the talent and intelligence evident in this film. After the Wedding is so honestly human that it does indeed break your heart. Happily it also hands you hope, a little laughter, and moments of tender warmth and love.
__label__2	Very Nearly Perfect: This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie.
__label__2	Traveled to Sweden.: This was such a beautiful film. Breathtaking! The best part was watching it with my movie buddy Sandra Zhao! I cannot wait to see it again. I truly felt like the movie had taken me on a trip to Denmark. I have still not watched the Lives of Other's which beat Pan's Labyrinth and this movie for Best Foreign Film. Can't wait to see it.
__label__2	very good: Beautiful movie. I always admired Danish cinematography and this feature was the best so far. Fabulous set of very talented actors. I loved it and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
__label__2	Moving story and film: I enjoyed this film. Although a tear jerker, I thought the acting was well done and the script was well written.
__label__2	Alls well that ends well: This is a perfect story of everything working out in the end. Im getting married and so decided to watch all the wedding movies I could find this didn't disappoint at all. It was great to watch a non-american film gives you an eye into other cultures.
__label__2	"Excellent Enz: Although a little uneven, this release has two timeless ballads (""Iris"" and ""One Step Ahead"") and some rollicking good time pop songs (History Never Repeats, I Don't Wanna Dance, Hard Act To Follow) and the dazzling ""Ships"" which is one of my favorite Enz songs. Actually I think it is better than thier debut and shows a lot of growth."
__label__2	"The real story of globalization: ""Before one can cry Big Mac, Larsson humbles the critic of globalization into silence. Larsson is William Blake's ""Mental Traveler,"" taking the reader through ""a land of men and women"": the slums of Rocinha in Rio where police are more dangerous than gangsters; a Bosnian mother supporting her blind husband and mentally retarded daughter on sweater knitting. Put down your placard and have a veggie burger, this guy's been there.""- Zachary Wales, Business Correspondent, United Press International"
__label__1	Sunny Side Up: I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book.
__label__1	is that fencer attacking with a bent arm?: and what is with the foot?Usually a preview should (as far as I know) show a good example that will motivate people to watch moreof it and this just isn't it...I haven't viewed the video or part you can download as yet but if this picture is an example of what it contains I am not too inclined to view more of it...what are these two fencers doing?is the one on the right attacking with a foot in the air,next arm and point way off target or are they retreating ?and if so what the .. are they doing? Balance?!?and the fencer on the left - are they attacking? bent arm? what is with the front foot?ok so maybe need to download it and view it but I have enough faults in my technique without viewing this....sorry was just looking up fencing on amazon and found this video download...sighand if you are wondering I have over 20 years of fencing - all three weapons and I like to think (some... may disagree...lol) that I am an ok fencer...
__label__1	"One of the worst movies I've ever seen: Poor story, worse acting, appalling film making. This film sems to have been made to ""showcase"" the dubious talent of its maker and lead ""actor"". I've seen hammers with more expression and talent. Don't bother unless you're masochistic enough to sit through it. Less enjoyable than chewing tyres."
__label__2	A powerful, moving film you can't stop watching....: even as it races towards its inevitable and forgone conclusion. This movie reached me in a place I didn't even know I had. Jesus Nebot's acting and directing ability should make him an international star. To me the two main characters in this drama are Pablo and Mrs. Knight, the bereaved mother (played by JAG's Susan Haskell in a gut-wrenching performance), forever connected to each other by an accidental tragedy with a cosmic resolution. This movie will stay with you.
__label__1	"Incorrect Order & Product Color Inconsistent: I ordered:4 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft BeigeThey sent:3 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft Beige -- (Note: See Color inconsistency note below)1 - Almay Liquid Makeup (which I did not order)Each of the 3 Revlon bottles was labeled as ""05 Soft Beige"" but visually looking at the makeup through the glass bottles, side by side, the actual color was markedly inconsistent.Out of the 4 bottles which I ordered, and paid for, only 1 was usable.Due to their lack of accuracy on the order fulfillment and the lack of quality control of the product, I will not order from them again."
__label__1	Age defying doesn't quite fit the product: I am a very young looking 61 years old woman. I don't wear foundation on regular basis, but sometimes I like to look extra nice. Revlon's age defiying foundation doesn't fit it's name. It looks good when you put it on, but after wearing it few hours, it magnifies every line on my face..actually I see some I never seen before. Honestly, if this is what make up foundation will do, I'll be much more content without it. Show me one that doesn't do it, and I'll become a believer... But surely, to call it age defying, it is simply not true!
__label__1	Not what she wanted: Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she read a few pages and quit because it was too sad. I told her it had a good ending but she won't try again, be prepared for tears when you read this one.
__label__1	sent wrong thing: I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both books (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it. The book looked nothing like the picture and it was very cleared written that I was supposed to get both. I got jipped.
__label__2	Child called it: this book is so heart felt. He makes you wonder how the system failed him and many others. I always wondered how his mother was never charged of put in jail for life. The very least be treated the same way.
__label__1	"A Child Called ""IT"" and The Lost Boy One Child 's Courage to Survive: Ordered this for Christmas about 3 weeks before it never came before or after, never had any response, very disappointed."
__label__2	Oustanding Historical Reference Volume: This work is an exhaustive study of the Luftwaffe's inventory from 1931 - 1945. Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended.
__label__2	BEST HOCKEY GAME EVER!!: This is the best hockey game ever. You'll never want to stop. There is every team and player. Theres a mode were 2 people can play each other and you can just play the com. just for fun. There is also a franchise mode where you go threw as many seasons as you want. You can also trade players and sign free agents. Theres also a draft after each season. You can also set the difficilly level to any thing you want. Theres also a season mode where you can just go through only 1 season. Also theres a playoffs mode were you skip the season and go right to the playoffs. It has the best grafics too. The bad thing is that you can't create your own team like in NFL 2K3. I recremend this game to everyone...
__label__1	Over-rated!!: I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. Even NHL Face-off is better than NHL 2k3. The graphics are only average and the controls are horrible. It feels like the players are skating in sand. The replays are ok but this game doesn't even have a create-a-player option. Sega should stick to football and basketball. Sorry Sega but I miss your Genesis games!
__label__1	THIS GAME STINKS!...: The only way to score on this game is dekes, rebounds and defelections. The gameplay stinks, the commontary stinks, DO NOT...waist your money on this game.
__label__2	Great Game.... :): This is a game everyone should play, great storyline, great graphics, and REALLY fun! I am proud to own the game and I reccommend it to about everyone!
__label__2	the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: in this game other than the fighting style the animated cut scenes have the best graphics. If your a fire emblem fan youmust buy this or just trying something new rent the game atblockbuster or at gamefly.com
__label__2	Best Fire Emblem Yet: I have this game and have beaten but boy it was hard. It took me like a month to beat it. What I love about it is it's on the Gamecube, their are little movie clips, the action and the adventure you take. I don't like that they took choosing classes away and the plot is later on in the story. BUY THIS GAME NOW!
__label__2	Fire Emblem on Game Cube: This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the story line is prety good. It has the weapon triangle like the rest of them, but the magic triangle changed which stinks. But, still in this one, you can give your units extra experience, you get to forge your own weapons, and you can change the color which is cool. The graphics are a bit better. But, still the same types of batte maps. Overall, this game is awesome!!!
__label__1	Worst game I have ever played: Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever.
__label__2	Best Fire Emblem Yet: This game is awesome! I got it and couldn't stop playing! The graphics are awesome! I played the two english fire emblems before it, but this one beats them all. The story line is pretty good,the graphics are awesome, cool new 'abilities' or 'skills', and able to choose weapon after class change. The only con for this game is that if you've ever played Fire Emblem Sacred Stones, you will find out that this game loses the choices of classes to change into. Multiple chapters or 'levels' to play through, many recruitable characters, new types of magic, and a bunch of new weapons. There are also new classes, including beasts and ravens. I hope you buy this game and that this guide has been helpful to you.
__label__2	Very fun game: In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting.
__label__2	Epic fun.: This has been an amazing experience to play and has a great chance to be one of the best Gamecube games I have played ever. One of the best games ever too. Definitely pick it up as it has lots of everything you can ask for. Definitely up there with FE7 as the best of the series.
__label__2	One of if not the greatest game I have ever played: This is a fantastic and near perfect game. The only minor imperfections are lack of some gameplay features that are added in the sequel. The characters are very interesting and unlike most games are not mere cliches to create gameplay. It does not have any fan service at all and is better because of it.
__label__2	another winner by mustang: It may be a five,but I won't actually get another ride in this year. The seat looks great, shipped fast and was easy to install. It certainly is heavier than the stock seat and wider with more back support.
__label__1	Crappy workmanship: One of the three pliers did not work at all when I got it. I had to take a file to modify the thing so the locking mechanism would engage.
__label__1	"RIP OFF, STOLEN WORKS: Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Instead buy the REAL thing, ""Let There Be Light"", by Darius Dinshah. Nothing else to say. Rip Off of Darius Dinshah's father's works!!!!!!!"
__label__1	Reminds me of a joke...: What do you call the medical school student who graduates at the bottom of the class? Doctor.
__label__2	A surprisingly effective fantasy for beginning readers: If you want to introduce the fantasy genre to a younger reader, I can't imagine a better starting place than this book. A lot of story is packed into this beginning chapter book. Although some profound issues are raised, I think what will appeal to most young readers is the adventure and the relationship between the boy and the new pet he brings home - which, in this case, happens to be a dragon! Readers will no doubt want to read the rest of the books in this series which, though not as good, are certainly entertaining.
__label__2	My daughter Love it!: My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan. This book, although she read it for school, she loved it. We read it once every 2 weeks, she now has certain lines memorized and loves to read it with me.
__label__1	Where are the Pictures?: I am very disappointed in this book. When I looked at it on Amazon there were pictures. Why was it not mentioned that there were no pictures in this particular book?Shame on you for misrepresenting this book. Now I have to return it and get one with Edward Lear's imaginative art work as well.
__label__1	"Disappointed: I ""bought"" this book for Kindle. All I got when I tried to read the book was a list of numbers that didn't correspond to anything. I'm glad the book was free so I can delete this without being out anything."
__label__1	pointless rubbish: Just as the title says, book of nonsense. A book of poorly written rhymes, lacking even a hint of smutty humour.
__label__1	Limericks: If you are looking for a nonsense limerick, this is the book for you - otherwise, keep looking. I kept looking.
__label__1	Weird, Uncomprehendable Book: This has to be the dumbest book I've read. It has riddles and rhymes that totally don't make sense. I know I would rather read real poetry and literature, not this. I don't even think that small kids would like this confusing book.
__label__1	???: This thing has about 3 poems in it. Terrible! Do NOT waste your time!!!!!!! Extra words extra words extra words
__label__2	"The Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear: He is the best of all writers of nonsense verse. He wrote ""The Owl and the Pussycat ""The Nonsense ABCs"", and numerous limmericks.dwahl"
__label__1	"This should not be listed on Amazon: This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
__label__2	"Excellent, classic, but...: I'm going to review this briefly as a book for children, which is what it is. I read most of this to my 3-year-old (including all the limericks and most of the poems, and a little of the other stuff). As long as I didn't read it too often, my son was usually game for this. He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.""The Owl and the Pussycat"" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition. It would help if the pictures were in color, but I gather you're getting it closer to what was published in the 19th century here."
__label__1	Formatting problems: The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out. This one was quite disappointing, since the limericks it contains appear as continuous text, so are quite inconvenient to read. It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!
__label__1	Kindle version - lost formatting: Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one.
__label__1	Not really readable: There are headings for pictures, but no pictures. So half the content is missing from this edition. And, the remaining limericks are just silly.
__label__2	WWE Road to Being the Best Game on the GameBoy Advance...: This game is so awesome, I got this game on Christmas Day and once I the plastic off, I grabbed my GBA and put it in. There are a huge variety of game modes in this game. Although this game only has 15 characters, this game is very attractive. The characters are very recognizable. And unlike the first Road to Wrestlemania, each character has a unique moveset. For example: The Rock has his Layin' the SmackDown Punch Rush, Undertaker has the Chokeslam and the Tombstone, Triple H has his Jumping Knee Attack, Chin Crusher, and his Spinebuster. The championship mode on this game is fun, although no storylines. You can win merchandise from ShopZone by by doing special tasks. You can create a PPV, but you must make the events enjoyable not only to the fans, but...Vince McMahon! Overall, this game is a great game, I recommend this to any Pro Wrestling fan. It is a fun and enjoyable game.
__label__1	enterence video: there is no enterence video,no storylines,much lesser wrestlers so its not enjoyable playing mode, so please next time just think about this things so it can be enjoyable while playing on GBA.
__label__1	Wrestlecrap: This is very slow and very limited. It has better graphics than Road to Wrestlemania but does not compare to it in anyway in terms of gameplay.Also it doesn't have STONE COLD STONE COLD THE RATTLESNAKE STONE COLD
__label__2	GREAT STUFF: If you want some good ol' fashion raw speed metal, this is your album. Fast, loud, and raw. This is one Motorhead album, ofcourse Motorhead is one great band. So yea, if you want some good speed metal this is for you.
__label__2	"Where to start with MOTORRRRRHEAD?: I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... ""Overkill"" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as ""Metropolis"", ""Stay Clean"" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of ""Overkill"" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover ""Louie Louie"" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice."
__label__2	"Good, but it gets better: Motorhead put their blueprint together for this album, and it is very good (especially ""Pay Your Price"" and ""I'll be Your Sister"") but they still needed to hone in on the speed and aggression."
__label__2	"Great Early Motörhead: One of Motörhead's best, ... offers their usual mix of groove infused speed metal with some atmosphere (""Capricorn"") and punk inspired hark rock (""Tear Ya Down""). A very strong album, with no weak tracks!"
__label__1	Wrong info: I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. I do love this album from Motorhead though.
__label__2	"The Perfect Portfolio: ""Perfect"" This book was incredibly helpful. I am just beginning to put my portfolio together and this book helped immensely. I found out what type of photos I should have, how they should be displayed, etc. Great Book!"
__label__2	"Better than New: I borrowed a copy of this book from a friend who said it only had 2 readings.When my ""used"" copy arrived through Amazon, it was like new, even betterthan my friend's. I am very pleased."
__label__1	Boring, ideas, not worth it!: I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween book, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy. After looking at it, the book was returned.Words cannot even describe the dissappointment I felt after glancing through it. Boring, old, uninviting, crafty suggestions. If you are looking for a good Halloween book for the not too crafty or the not too gory, games, treats, decorations, try 101 Halloween Ideas.
__label__1	"So much potential.: This is one of those books that I like the *idea* of, but not so much the execution. It's gotten to the point where if a book has the word ""spooky"" (or a variation) on the cover, I'm just going to assume it's not. The idea - offering ideas for six themed parties - would make for an excellent book if they were all actually Halloween-themed. Sadly, even the Halloween-specific party suggestions fall a little flat."
__label__2	Thuvia is great: As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series). As a youth, when I first bought the book, I had my doubts; having cut my 'martian teeth' on Pricess and Warlord. However, true to Burroughs style, the action picked up quickly and was on par with the other books in the series. A great read.
__label__2	I adore this series: Romantic, full of action and rich dialogue and imagery, this series will last forever (despite the epic fail of the Disney movie).
__label__1	Less substance than a Cugel novel.: Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance...
__label__2	A good read.: Follow John Carter's son Carthoris on his first adventure in the series. It was a quick read for me that left me looking forward to the next book.
__label__2	classic: Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction.Our hero is framed for the abduction of princess Thuvia, so he goes to rescue her and clear his name.It's also a pretty classic romance plot, with the hero and heroine in love with each other, but unsure how the other feels, and societal/political conventions standing in their way. *shhhh... don't tell.
__label__1	not good: I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
__label__2	Better than I remembered it!: Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individual's right to seek success, the strength to stand up for one's own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didn't see the recent movie that came out based on the series; kind of glad that I didn't. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide.
__label__2	A great find!: I recently discovered this band while surfing the net.I sampled a few songs off their website,and I really loved Bemoaned Animosity.I wasn't sure if I'd like them that much,but wow was I wrong.Their tagline says it all,Death Trash Chaos!This cd has got to be one of my favorites,an instant classic for me.I find it difficult to compare them to other bands,as they have their own sound.My sister chuckled when she heard the name of the cd,but after she heard the title track,she was hooked and loves it as much as I do.It's certainly heavy,but blends thrash and death metal so well that I never really notice,cause I'm to busy head bangin'!
__label__2	Metal all the way.: This band has some very good music. The track 'Let Me Be Your Tank' has to be my favorite off the entire album.
__label__2	Cheaper (and maybe better than) a Therapist: Though not a fan of his astrological writings for Vanity Fair, this book is mind-blowing. I have had it for over 20 years (even had it rebound at Kinkos). It has truly helped me reinterpret the motivation of countless people in my life in a way that's helped me improve those relationships. It's a book like no other in the way it helps me make sense of other people's actions by understanding their point of view (haven't read his new book yet).
__label__2	astrology: This a the book everyone should have- from serious students of the stars, to consultants, to people who know nothing at all about astrology. It's brilliant, hilarious, and ORIGINAL. You won't find a lot of this information in any other astrology books and it is accurate-
__label__2	Couldn't Be Better!: Having never heard of this band before, I picked up this album from a Border's Bookshop store where I could sample the tunes first. Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing. I cannot recomment this album more highly!
__label__2	A very good album: The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch.
__label__2	A sonic summer's day: I think this is the best Sea & Cake album so far. Song for song, this stands up against any of their previous albums, and it's their most cohesive album to date as well. The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences. There are touches of synthesizers, there are breezes of strings, the guitars dance around each other, the drums create rhythms that are part latin, part kraut rock, while the bass anchors the entire album, creating a foundation (a mobile dynamic foundation) for the other players to weave their sounds around.
__label__2	"whoa: Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to ""all the Photos"" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."
__label__2	"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music.....: Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
__label__1	"Snoozic: This idea was interesting on their earlier albums. If I listen to Oui ten times, I can't recall a single song, or even a single idea. Nothing here is memorable. It's sonic wallpaper. If you like this record, you sure are in luck. There are thousands of boring, fungible records like this released in the mid-60s from Brazil, France, etc. This is not to say that all of this type of stuff is worthless. Rather, now that the Sea and Cake's output is an emotionally devoid genre exercise, there are many other mediocre examples to collect and savor. I'm sure most of them are similarly ""positive,"" as our reviewer friend from Venezuela found Oui to be."
__label__1	"Boring: Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and ""Afternoon Speaker"" is it. It even gets a bit monotonous, but at least it's perky and interesting. Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep."
__label__1	OK: Pretty horrible. Like in WWE women cant wrestle.Expecially harcore wrestling.Sexxxy eddy was the best part of the whole dvd. There is no bonus matches wtf!? It says there are but there isnt its just the tournament. Do not buy! I should have listened to the review but i didnt
__label__2	"A ""MUST HAVE"" book for IBD info: I have been so impressed by this book. As a UC sufferer of many years, I really felt at home reading it. There were so many things that I could relate to! The information is up-to-date and incredibly informative and helpful! And the quotes from everyone are just great - they really touched my heart and helped me to know that I am not alone in my thoughts and feelings.For those with IBD, or their friends and family, this book is an exceptional addition to the library. If you buy nothing else regarding this disease, buy this one!"
__label__1	"completely useless - garbage: at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program... cheap, uses up very minimal resources, simple to use.. lifetime subscription for free.. what could be wrong?EVERYTHING. see, the problem isn't that this program can't find viruses.. the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. that's right, it leaves the viruses right there!! how is that useful in any way? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses, but still the log report would announce to me ""(this many) viruses could not be deleted or cleaned."" well, thanks for nothing. i'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program."
__label__1	Subscription Flawed?: Bought the 2005 program in the spring. I've been using this program for about 4 months, now the program prompts me to renew my subcription. I can't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription. Other programs give you one year of use before renewing. I'm not certain if this product is working correctly. I'm going to use a different product instead.
__label__1	Beware, it crashed my Hard disk!: I downloaded EZ Antivirus trial version from CA and Installed it on my laptop (XP Professional SP1). After installation the software started scanning automatically, which I allowed it to do and left my laptop alone. The laptop caught my attention when it started rebooting again and again. I realized my hard disk was also making a lot of noise.I went to CA's website and couldn't find any number to call. So I started web chat with their support. The support said that I might have installed the software with another anti-virus already working on my laptop. As per him, now only Microsoft can fix my problem. He said he would escalate the issue and copy me the email, which I'm still awaiting.To fix my hard disk I tried XP setup, Restore disks, and even reformatting the hard disk. Nothing works. I had to throw the hard disk.So just a friendly warning... stay away!!!
__label__1	breaks other programs, can't uninstall: DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. On install the etrust antivirus software (nothing else just antivirus) broke my Zone Alarm firewall, interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up. I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install; they keep popping up with guess what error message? That's right, please uninstall Etrust antivirus software, it is incompatible with our software. I've emailed Etrust and tried thier 'live' online chat and get no response. The software is evil, it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it. I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand. Don't repeat my mistake!!!
__label__1	Very Disappointed: I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply. The reply was to go to their update center and to renew. I sure wasn't going to pay again for something I only had for two months and its suppose to last for a year.I'll be going back to my trusted Norton Antivirus, it may be slow but at least I only have to buy it once a year.
__label__1	Unable to uninstall: Once my year-long subscription expired, I have been unable to uninstall CA ETrust. It now pops up a nag window about every 20 minutes, and when you click exit, it pops up a browser window and takes you to CA's web page. I have tried uninstalling many different ways to no avail. This has been going on for months and makes my computer painful to use.My attempts to reach support are futile. Their support page doesn't work in my browser (IE 6.0) and the phone line is pay (which I will probably end up paying).This is much worse than a virus. At least with a virus I can go buy Norton and clean things up.
__label__1	Stoner Rock, I think not!: First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed.
__label__1	POOR Quality, stay away!!: One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof.
__label__1	Couldn't use it: After adjusting the leg pieces for several days (wearing socks & boots)and then even replacing these with foam rolls I still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product, even at a 45degree incline. I know somebody else who has one and they like it so I guess it depends on the person, I am not heavy for my size and never thought this would be an issue.
__label__1	Does not work with palm easily: Did not work with my Palm T|C right away.I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C.
__label__2	card is actually 66x not 133x: The product title is incorrect. This card is 10MB/s (up to 66x). That is what it actually says on the box, not 133x. It isn't a problem for me because 66x is plenty fast for my panasonic fx30 camera. But if you really require 133x (i.e. 20MB/s) this is not the card for you.
__label__1	Do not order this part from RitzCamera: I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). Ritzcamera will cheat you. You can find the part they sent me for $20 less on Amazon with free shipping.
__label__1	I don't have answers to your questions: I gave this item as a gift. I don't have answers to your questions. I thought the doll was very expensive. Diane
__label__2	This book explains the work of God in a way that make sense.: This book answers hard questions regarding God and our existance in a way that is very racional. I could not find one thing that didn't have a logical explanation regarding the spiritual way of looking at things. It is bealtiful, positive, and only talks about love. It has helped me see life in a different way and respect God's work. I learned that he is in charge at all times, protecting us, and will give us eternal life. This knowledge will help you cope better with every day life issues, tragedies, etc. I hope everyone in the world would read this book and live accordingly, which will happen with time.
__label__1	NOT REALLY A LUNCH BOX: This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price.
__label__1	"Overpriced: I cannot believe the ""discounted"" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3.00 (that's right, $20 less). Search on ""key float""."
__label__2	Well worth the price: Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else.It bolted up almost perfectly, had to pull one corner slightly to line up with the mounting hole, but this was not hard to solve.Packaging was a little scanty for a heavy product, but again, for the low price it came in great condition, just a few scratches because the box was broken in a few places. But this product is going under my car, not to be seen and polished.Very good value, I would recomend this to anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive hitch receiver.
__label__1	Doesn't fit!: The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it.
__label__2	An honest look at goaltending: I found this book to be an honest look at the world of hockey goaltending from mites to the pros. My son, who is a youth hockey goalie, enjoyed reading Robb's history and hockey philosophy. A good book for all hockey goalie parents, especially those who are new to the goalie world.
__label__1	I've never heard a worse one: In all the years of my life, I'm sure I've never heard such an awful musical. No wonder it was a flop! The story is ridiculous, the songs are silly and the music is incredibly bad. It makes COCO, BIG or LI'L ABNER ( a trilogy of disastrous music) sound like WEST SIDE STORY. Among the ten worst Broadway musicals of all times, this one has the honor to be TOP 1!
__label__2	Inspiring to tree-huggers!: This book is a great book for those who care about the earth. There are so many great quotes and stories that are still relevant to our societal values. We use this book at camp to open campers' eyes to the world around them. The contents are a great inspiration and conversation starters.
__label__1	You don't buy this one for the plot or the acting.: What little plot there is is an old one. Aliens send a rep. here to look us over. Only this one is only interested in our sex lives. Plenty of good looking babes. No acting tallent. The music bites.
__label__1	Pervasive Silicone Enhancement: Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com).
__label__2	great movie: this movie was for both men and women. the shots in the movie were very well done, the music was cool and it is one I would be pleased to own. It had a style that made sex very sexy and not dirty.
__label__1	Relaxing viewing time: A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
__label__1	Femalien: For this kind of movie your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. But that's what happened.Only 1 person could act. Most of the women where max 5s. The best part of the movie is the front cover.
__label__1	Femalien: This is one of the worst plots, but no worse than many porn plots. The Femalien, who is obviouslyover-sexed, is sent to Earth to observe and participate in human experience -- almost all of it sexual. Contains frontal nudity.
__label__1	Crappy: Should have 0-star as a choice. Horrible excuse for a sci-fi movie. I don't see what the other reviewers seen in here. Poor DVD quality. Lucky for me, I don't plan on watching it again.
__label__2	Aliens Study the Sensual Arts: I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon. As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien. Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions. The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for.
__label__1	Femalien: The R rated DVD of this movie is not worth the price. It's cut to smithereens. Buy the unrated version, instead.
__label__1	See It: See this move for Matt Schue. I think that is his name. If it is the long haired blonde dude. He is so hot.
__label__1	Don't waste your money!: No plot,waste of time and money in this 'Disney Porn' flick with ugly girls and stupid story line,Stay away!!!
__label__1	Femalien: A soft adult movie. Good to watch once if you are in the mood for that type of movie.Save your money and get something else.
__label__2	Good ending: While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad.
__label__1	"Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!: Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."
__label__1	"Wow, what a letdown: I thought this movie was going to have an incredible plot - All I wanted was to be able to go home and watch a really bad movie. This movie was different. It went beyond the limit of manass. It would have been better with Chuck Norris- 10 TIMES BETTER. ""Sun"" should have had more speaking parts where we could get to know her better. Next time, see Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie instead."
__label__1	"Nil Science Fiction, Strong Sexual Content: Because this video in unrated and carries no warning in the information area I feel shoppers should be aware that this by all rights a soft core porn film with strong sexual content and little science fiction. I bought the VHS version from another source expecting the sort of movie ""Roger Corman Presents"" might sponsor, something along the lines of ""Species"" or Amanda & the Alien. While more in the vein of the latter the sci-fi part, {or any other technology for that matter}, is limited to a few teleportations via telekinesis and some aura/emotion melding. The movie is probably 60% by time made of sexual contact. Technically the movie is suprisingly well made for the genera. It is shot on film {not video tape}. The scenery is professionally done and the acting level reaches that of daytime soap operas. The sound quality is not bad. So the technical qualities are there to be transfered to DVD, just beware of the content."
__label__2	close encounters of the sexy kind: As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up.
__label__1	"What a waste: I had the movie before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the ""Flyboys Game"" I thought I would buy it off the market place. Good seller, but the DVD did not come with the game as advertised. It only came with a DEMO version of the game. They should have said that on the box. Thanks a bunch for false advertisement. Thought the other extras might make up for it, WRONG! Don't waste your time or money."
__label__1	"pretty awful: I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
__label__2	"Well Worth Watching: Like the movies ""Titanic"" and ""The Great Escape"", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the ""Lafayette Escadrille"". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen ""The DaVinci Code"" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."
__label__1	completely disappointing: I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This cliché-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead.
__label__1	Terrible - I walked out of this movie: When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype.
__label__1	A movie or a music video??: What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser.
__label__2	Romanticism and Reality: All the elements of a great movie. What can I say, I love to study the elements of war, and I enjoy a good love story along the way. This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie.
__label__2	High Flying Adventure: This movie is very fun and entertaining. It does slow down quite a bit at times developing the subplots, but even two solid hours of nothing but action would get monotonous and boring.It explores the bravery, sacrifice, and even politics exemplified by so many in so many wars. In this case it is WWI. It is the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, among the very first fighter pilots, as they take on the Germans. There is lots of action, great cinematography, a good plot, and a love story as well.Despite any inaccuracies with the aircraft in this movie, it is nothing that a non-expert would notice. The flying scenes may be CGI, but it is done very well. A very enjoyable movie.
__label__1	Another computer generated teen brain flick: The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can't watch this thing....You can not fly next to each other and yell back and forth between aircraft... They had hand signals for that... the story line is far from historical... I guess is Ok as a highschool date movie...
__label__2	great movie: i thought it was a very entertaining movie, should have gotten more press when it came out. very good acting also
__label__2	"WWI movie review: This was an excellent movie that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized.) There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual ""composite characters"" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a ""team,"" but this was better than most. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I reserve those ratings for the truly outstanding movie that comes along rarely."
__label__1	"Is There A Cliche That Wasn't Used?: This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
__label__1	"Ho Hum Effort: Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
__label__2	Flyboys (Collector Edition): The movie has 8.5 calification, the special effect are very good, in this new time of best movies, this movie its the first movie about the First World War; the DVD has 8.7 calification, god presentation, the postal pictures from the movies are good, the extras from the movie are good.My final calification is 8.7, is a very good movie, the scense and the flow of the story is good.Please buy this title
__label__1	"What A Bust----Don't Waste Your Money: I'm glad I didn't go out and buy this movie. Thankfully, I just rented it. It starts out moving very slow, which some movies do. However, this movie never ""gets going"". The plot does not flow well, the actors lines don't always fit in to the scene, the background music does nothing for the movie, & there is a love side story thrown in for good measure. The computer animation of the air battles is the only good thing about this movie. My wife & I both watched it together. We both did not enjoy it. While watching the movie I actually thought about just ending the movie early. My advice, rent it before you buy it!If you want to see good WWI movies, then watch: The Blue Max, Paths Of Glory, The Lost Battalion"
__label__1	"Thank God for fast forward: I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
__label__1	Flyboys: What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on?
__label__2	pretty good wwi movie: they don't bother to make many wwi movies anymore, so i was excited to see this one. the script is admittedly not very good, and the performances were kind of lame but they did not have good dialogue to work with. despite this i still enjoyed watching the movie as the combat sequences were very very realistic and had wonderful sound. it is great to finally see combat the way it probably really happened and feel adrenalin pumping. i thought that one scene in the howard hughes movie with decaprio got this across, and this movie continues what that scene suggested. too bad whoever wrote the script was not very smart or this could have been a classic.
__label__2	"Fly Boys Lafayette Escadrille,movie for Plane lovers!!: The ""experts"" always!! This movie is enjoyable,the air battle scenes are very well done,story well told,it is for planes lovers not for history or movie ""experts"",the dogfights are fantastic!!I RECOMMEND for any plane Lover!!For the History ""experts"",Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, formerly the Marquis de La Fayette (or Lafayette) (September 6, 1757-May 20, 1834) was a former French aristocrat and military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions.He permanently renounced the title ""Marquis"" before the French National Assembly in June, 1790.)Lafayette served in the American War of Independence both as a general and as a diplomat, serving entirely without pay in both roles.Movies are for Entertainment!!I highly recommend this movie."
__label__1	"Boring, don't waste your time: This movie is so boring. I was looking forward to it. But they bash America and the flying scenes look fake.Long boring love story that ends with both characters not finding each other.Rent or buy ""The Blue Max"" it's much better."
__label__2	Almost great: I am not sure which movie all the critics were watching, obviously not the same one I was watching. Granted it could of been better in the development of characters but if they'd included the amount of detail some people would want then the movie would be as long as WW1. The computer generated dog fight scenes are great and keep you on the edge of your seat. It has its funny and sad moments but not too many dull moments. So if you're looking for a couple of hours of entertainment give it a try, if you're looking for a sickly love interest go and watch Titanic for the 50th time..
__label__2	One Of The Best This Year !: After I watched this film I was ready to watch it again. This is a fantastic movie; if you love a great action packed film with a beautiful scenery and a wonderful story of courage, friendship and love. You will enjoy this film. With a love of history in it's truest form. Don't listen to the critics they never know what they are talking about I somtimes wonder if they even watch the films they talk about. Watch this film you will enjoy every sec. of it.
__label__1	Flyboys! Don't think so: Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste....
__label__1	"Hollywood commercial film-making to the bone: Every possible cliche is here. The sound track smashes you in the head all the time. GCI battles cuks the life out of the movie. I'd prefer to watch again 1966's ""The Blue Max"" thatn ""Flyboys"".However, what makes this fil going and even somewhat tender to watch are the performances. There's some eracl acting here by James Franco and Jean Reno and the supoorting cast, even if they all clearly know this is an extremely commercial and cliched movie."
__label__1	"Should been better: Nice actions, but if you looking for a more authentic WWI aerial combat drama try ""Der Rote Baron"" instead."
__label__2	A great action-adventure film.: Flyboys has been severely critisized for being historically inaccurate. However, for all other reasons this is a great film. The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film. So if you don't worry about the historical inaccuracy, this is a film you will enjoy. Join me next time for my reveiw on the 2004 film National Treasure.
__label__2	Good Buy: It isn't the best movie in the world, but it is definitely one that should be watched in HD with Surround Sound. It is a must for my library.
__label__1	Have any of you who said this was good seen Blue Max?: Obviously by all the 5 star reviews who think the dogfight seens are great have never seen the Blue Max. This is what WWI airplanes flew like, not the cartoon in Flyboys. The only disapointment in the Blue Max is George Peppard is not german. Don't buy flyboys, watch it on cable.
__label__1	"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting....: Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
__label__1	A $1 rental: The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected.
__label__2	best movie of the year: Its sad that the movie will only last a week or two in the theatres since it is a good rip roaring adventure that loosely follows the Lafayette Escadrille in WWI. The special effects are excellent, the planes and action appears to be real. If you get a chance see it on the big screen, it will lose a lot on video
__label__1	You've got to be kidding me!: Well, let's not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible movie. Being an Air Force veteran, I like movies with planes, old and new, but I have to tell you this wasn't one of them. Acting was poor for the most part, historical aspects, well they get a grade of F-, including the planes, and supposed time period. All wrong. I usually like to watch a movie, and enjoy it, without analyzing it, but this one was different, and I could not help myself. I kept hoping it might get better, but no luck. So, Nothing ventured, Nothing gained, and I would not recommend this film to anyone! Period! Adios!
__label__1	"Save Your Money: Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"
__label__1	this is the funniest movie i've ever seen: i watched this movie and thought it was hilarious i didnt go five minutes without laughing. I loved all the random animals that kept popping up, and i especially loved the way the french chick instantly started talking like a mongoloid while she was learning english. At the end i couldn't take away one good thing from this movie. It is just terrible
__label__1	"CRITICS GOT THIS ONE RIGHT!!!!: This movie was so awful, I felt compelled to warn others NOT to rent it & certainly not to buy it. Sorry, but this was a stinker. The battle sequences were OK, but they weren't enough to overcome the shallow & predictable ""plot""--there were these incredibly long, boring stretches where the cardboard characters kind of looked at each other and muttered horribly cliche, stale dialogue. It didn't try to be realistic; I found myself going ""Oh yeah, right"" countless times. This really is a waste of time & money. save yourself!!!Or dont say that I didnt tell you."
__label__2	"The Sky is the Limit: The true story of the Lafayette Escadrille comes to life in MGM's action packed war movie ""Flyboys"" The young american men who fought for the French and became the first fighter pilots during the Great War. It's one of the best war movies ever made, a thrill ride into history, the best WWI movie since ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" It's spectacular, a great war film. See ""Flyboys"""
__label__2	"EXCITING & ENTERTAINING ! FORGET THE CRITICS !: While this film may not win an academy award the aerial fighting sequences make it well worth the money ---plus the acting from relatively unknown actors was not bad at all----Those people who tout all the films historical errors tis IS a fictionalized account of Lafayette Escadrille how many of the critics especially some of the women critics have even heard of this name before? --Name one WW1 aviation film that has gotten it all correct you can't --""The Blue Max one of my favorites had pilots pulling on some sort of handle to fire their machine guns (all wrong) and had lozenge camouflage on the Fokker Triplanes which was also wrong --there is plenty wrong but I still loved the Blue Max as I love this film too---Maybe director Peter Jackson (King KONG) (who is rumoured considering) remaking the BLUE MAX WILL GET ALL THE SMALL DETAILS RIGHT AND ALSO make a kickass film that even the critics will have to love! Go see FLYBOYS You will be entertained!"
__label__1	"Painfully fake: For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
__label__1	A truly bad movie: Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
__label__2	Overall purchase: I wasn't sure what to think of the movie since I remembered hearing little about it. But it has become one of my favorite movies, especially war movies that try to tell some real truth about the time frames they cover. The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would. I believe the movie is excellent. The DVD arrived two days earlier than expected, so the seller gets a solid A, not only for speed of shipment but for speed of receipt. DVD in perfect condition.
__label__2	Visually Stunning: I loved the Movie, it has everyting Great direction, Stunning visuals, Good looking cast, Great locations, Superb arieal fight scenes, Awesome Blu Ray picture & sound quality..Other than some great action, it covers Romance, Friendships & some more..pssst now thats for you to watch & find out!!
__label__1	"What a Lemon: I ordered Flyboys because I had seen stills of the replica Neuports and they looked fantastic! As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of ""the skunk of the year award"" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that? Will we ever find out?Well for me The Blue Max towers above this movie despite being over 40 years its senior. Flyboys is a dog worse than Pearl Harbour yes we have the technology but that cannot make up for a very poor and purile script and wooden acting."
__label__1	Be Forwarned!!!: I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like.
__label__2	"Flyboys: The acting and aircraft sequences are very good. I enjoyed the movie, but if it is based on a true story, then I would have to read it. I found the ending a bit ""hoakey"". If you like WWI movies, like ""The Blue Max"", you will enjoy this one."
__label__2	FLYBOYS: I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.
__label__1	"Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else: This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
__label__2	If you're a student of the first air war...you'll love this.: Super sound and visuals bring WWI air combat to life. For 90 years, the story of the first aces & fighter-planes has been limited to our imaginations, grainy pictures and mediocre films. Based on a true story with plenty of artistic license, Flyboys is fun to watch. An enjoyable story that puts the moviegoer in the cockpit. After watching this, you'll respect those Flyboys and be glad you weren't in the cockpit! The DVD is crisp, the audio great, the flying scenes spectacular, the story good.
__label__2	FLYBOYS SOARS! Blu ray review.: Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!
__label__2	Fly Boys: A very good account of WW1 flying aces. With a story line added to keep interest it realisticly accounts our early participation in WW1. With violent content viewers should be aware that it is not suited for younger viewers.
__label__1	Save Your Money: I'm sorry I ever purchased this movie. Eddie Rickenbacker must be rolling over in his grave. Absolutely no relationship to reality. An insipid story line and unrealistic special effects. If you want a good WWI movie, go with All Quiet on the Western Front (with Lew Ayers) or the Blue Max (with George Peppard). Forget this drival.
__label__1	Might make a good coaster: I went to see this in the theater and myself and two friends could not go the distance. We walked out before it was over. The plot is ridiculous and the acting does not make up for it.
__label__1	"Crap.: Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
__label__2	Excellent aviation movie: No it doesnt have A list actors in it but some are recognizable. The plot is entertaining. What makes this move a must see is the dawn of avation and combat tied into one movie. If you even remotely have an interest in military aviation, buy this movie.
__label__2	The story is a bit campy, but the flying scenes are excellent!: This is a movie that does a great job of using CGI to create some awesome scenes. Despite the formula plot and silly side-show drama, the flying scenes make this movie worth watching over and over.
__label__2	Remembering old times: The music is just as I remember it! It brings back so many memories... The only disappointment, is that is not 100% digital, it has been recorded from a long play, and you can still hear the needle going on the disc. Besides that is perfect!
__label__2	Tight Dope: Dude, this CD is all sick! It is so totally awesome, you MUST buy it. The songs each have a unique sound, and personally I don't think any of them suck. They're all so happy!!! And the people who don't like this CD can suck it. So, if you don't wanna be a nark, buy this CD. Yo! Whaddup New Mexico? (Yes, it is part of the United States)
__label__1	"This is not ""98 Degrees that play their own instruments""!: What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
__label__1	"Sheesh, pull kids away from the radio!: I don't own this, which is surprising because I love to ""discover"" new acts. You want to know why I didn't buy this? I don't think they should even be allowed to sell this garbage! ""When I get you all alone, I'm gonna take off all your clothes, ain't nobody gonna interupt my game."" I couldn't believe that a song like that could make it onto the airwaves. I know you'll make fun of ""Genie In A Bottle,"" but I don't care, it's innocent and cute when a girl does it. When a guy sings stuff like this, I want to throw a rock at 'em!"
__label__2	"This is one of my all time favorite cd's!: I absolutely love this cd. It reminds me of the 80's music I grew up on. When I first heard ""Ooh it's kinda crazy"" I did think it was George Michaels and I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this cd that Soul Decision is talented enough to write their own lyric's I don't think there is a song on this cd that I don't like. This cd puts me in a good mood, if you can appreciate a good love song and enjoy easy listening music with a pop and funky beat this cd is for you! I hope they come out with another cd soon."
__label__2	Souldecision's a hit!: Hey,I have been lucky enough to meet Trevor(blond spiky hair and lead singer) Dave-brown hair, Ken(other blond plays keyboards and they are very nice guys! Their cd is also good, especially Let's Do It Right, Faded, Ooh It's Kind of Crazy. If you like pop with a beat to it definately SD is for you!
__label__2	The Bomb: this cd is the bomb that has great songs like fadded, stay, and gravity. this is an awsome CD so buy it or u made a bad decison so by No one Does it better by soulDeicion
__label__2	"Great album: For anyone who considers them in the ""boyband"" category, they were around making (playing the instruments, and writing the songs) their music long before the current craze; besides, if it's all about the music, it's a different sound, though still firmly in pop. Most of the CD flows pretty easily, the lyrics actually say something, and avoid ""bad/sad""-type cheesy rhymes. Faded and No One Does It Better are far and away the best, but that doesn't mean the others aren't good. Looking for a strong sophomore effort to keep Canada on the music map.. (I know Vancouver puts everyone in a good mood, but maybe next time with more than one song in a minor key!?)"
__label__2	Needed in every Brio railway layout: This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size. The male-male and female-female pieces will provide a dramatic increase in the number of layouts possible as you can now overcome the problem of curves returning to the starting position.This is a must-have for any Brio enthusiast.
__label__2	religious guides: I am impressed with the language and content of the Missionary Pal: Reference Guide> I did not expect to see references from several religions, but was glad they were mentioned. This way I gained a better understanding thru comparison.
__label__2	Great Item!: We were so excited to get this item. We have a missionary out right now and he requested it about 9 months ago but we had no success in finding it. UNTIL NOW! I haden't even thought of looking on Amazon. Great shipping and our missionary is finding this to be very handy. Thankyou!
__label__1	Bias Shows Through: While this book is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. If this book were to be shared with people of non-Mormon faiths, they would become very defensive and rightly so. The author's invective toward the Catholic faith is appaling. Many Mission Presidents do not recommend this book. It could be dangerous in the hands of the untrained.
__label__1	"THESE COME AS ONE PAIR, & NOT 3 PAIRS AS PICTURED!!: I'm sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed...my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price. I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and ""false advertising"", as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price. Hope I enjoy the socks, but thought I'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you'll receive."
__label__2	Great Socks: I wear these socks on a daily basis and I am very happy with them. They are about the only pair I've found that will actually stay up on/above my calves for any period of time.
__label__2	Gold Toe is the Gold Standard: Love these socks from Gold Toe. They last and they are well made. Most of my socks are Gold Toe.
__label__2	fab book for cowboy gear: This book is fascinating for its images & history for me the Aussie, we just dont have these cowboy suits in our history, & as a sewer who makes cowboy shirts in Oz, it interested me greatly, I got a 2nd hand ex library book & it was mint. Seems like an invaluable keeper to me.
__label__1	they have taken a step back: i was also excited about buying this game only to find out that the people at visual concepts had taken a big step back. i was a fan of the series on dreamcast and had easily handed it the best basketball game of 2000 - 2002. well i purchased this game 4 days ago and haven't found a way to play more than 10 minutes total. to me the graphics look no better on gamecube than it did on dreamcast. second of all the gameplay ... the dunks look worse, the post play is horrible and the high lob passes will drive you crazy...the menus are confusing also. i don't think nba live 2003 is the answer but this game doesn't do it for me either. play 2k2 and save your money.
__label__2	This game rocks!: Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!
__label__2	Completely amazing!: The signer's voice is wonderful and the beat gets you moving. The lyrics are very sweet too. Between 2:06 and 2:48 there's an excellent beat rising and then it goes on with the moving beat. Any trance lover got to listen to that! :) I know some may say it's quite cheesy because of the vocals but I think it's a very good song on overall.
__label__1	Dry and Humorless: I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars.
__label__1	Booooring!!: This game is way to easy. The camara gets all twichi and there's not enough weapons.There are some cars that may be impossible to unlock(I think that way because you need to get to mission #18).I highly reccomend to rent it before buying it.
__label__1	Saperstein is a no talent: He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
__label__2	The best of Raymond Chandler: This book, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book! Read The Long Goodbye, then read it again. This is not just a great mystery, but it is also great literature.
__label__1	Long drawn out...all over the place!!!!: I saw this movie at the UMFF. It was toooo long. It was into 67 mins and still haven't got to the point. The storylines ...well so are all over the place. I would recommend putting on this movie if you have insomia. Trust me it will put you to sleep
__label__2	Energetic, Tantelizing, and Spiritually Moving!: Wendy Rule has done it again, with this release. Her writing style, and vocals give her music a unique and undescribable sound. Anyone who has been searching for Wiccan/Pagan music artists will be delighted. For those who aren't Wiccan or Pagan, her music is sweet no matter what!
__label__2	Sorry Wendy: I would have given this album a 5 had I not heard Zero first, but then nothing beats a live performanceBB
__label__2	Music for the 21st Century: This is one fantastic CD.The combination of musicians that are on this CD take the music to another place. I am a big Miles Davis fan and first heard of Jason Miles when I got TuTu many years ago.On this Cd he has managed to create a musical universe that I have not heard on a CD for quite sometime. It's funky,lush,melodic,hard hitting and has the musical integrity that many Cds that try to be commercial don't have.I played this for my 17 year old son and he just loved it.The music has the ability to speak to alot of different audiences and age groups.I love the track Voices on The Corner. It's music that I've never heard before.I agree with the reviewer here who can't figure out why Jason Miles isn't a household name. Hopefully this CD will change that
__label__2	I finally found a book I can understand: I have read this book slowly and thoughtfully, letting Jesus' words sink in. This book has helped me to really grasp much of what Jesus meant in his stories. I will read this again and again.
__label__2	Easy to read, packed with wisdom: I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Parables. I didn't expect this book to be overflowing with facts on jewish culture. Gary does an excellent job describing the context for each parable. Gary picked essential parables and truly helps you understand what Jesus meant. One nice surprise is Gary's theological application. If you like books that flow but have a deeper teaching then you should buy this book. Let this book be a deeper devotional or a study tool for your next teaching on a parable. I promise you will be inspired and encouraged by Gary's interpretation of the Parables.
__label__2	Excellent read!: I've given three or four away for others to read... If you enjoy the parables you'll definitely want to get this book...
__label__2	"The Parables Review: As a Precepts on Precepts student doing a 23 lesson study on Matthew, I thought this would be a good book to help understand Jesus' parables better. Kay Aurthur advocates letting scripture interpret scripture. The author of ""The Parables"" did a nice job, but I guess I was looking for more indepth analysis of the various parables. I would recommend this book; it is an easy read and does give a lot of information about the parables. Maybe if I were to read it a second time I'm sure I would get more out of the book. It's like reading the bible, you are always discovering a truth that you did not see before."
__label__2	Beautiful: This movie is just brillant! Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fabulous. and Liv Tyler sparkles. Plunkett and Macleane had all elements of a memorable movie that you'll want to watch again and again!
__label__1	The Velvet Goldmine with wigs and panniers: The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad. Pretty costumes, pretty direction, a nifty techno soundtrack, and Robert Carlyle make watching Plunkett & McLeane worthwhile only if you're in the mood for a ninety-minute music video. Brainless fun.
__label__1	"To waste time only.: If, according to the editorial review, you either desire to lavish the director of this picture with affection or to slap him silly, I advocate the latter. An amateurish attempt to lend some ""hipper than thou"" gloss to a mediocre plotline. Even the actors themselves seem uninspired by the material. Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."
__label__1	Pretentious and Predictable: There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair.
__label__1	One of the worst movies EVER !!!!: I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film.
__label__2	A Real Sleeper: Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate.
__label__2	Pleasently Surprised: I bought this movie on a whim, knowing that two of my favorite actors were in it, but also knowing it had not done well in the theatres and that one of my LEAST favorite actresses was in it. However, after viewing this movie, I'm shocked at how good it was. The music threw me at first, but I soon got into the mood. Knowing that Ridley Scott's son directed this movie also gives it merit. I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!
__label__2	A new old fantasy: A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it.
__label__2	Beautiful Photos, Great Info: I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers.
__label__1	"TeddyBears: Okay...........I'll admit that The TeddyBears got a good hit in ""CobraStyle"".........however, someone out there please reference me back to a hit from the 60's or 70's that has the same beat and melody and a lot of organ and drums.Please...............it is driving me crazyTed in the Sanitarium Lobby"
__label__2	"Techno with a twist: A group that's fairly unknown in the south but worth a listen. You may remember their song, ""PUNKROCKER"" a few years back on a Cadillac commercial."
__label__2	"Captures a certain amount of Zeitgeist: Disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of music, inasmuch as I prefer rock and adult contemporary. After hearing the appetizer ""Cobrastyle"" as a current staple of the alternative radio realm, I was anxious to see the full menu. I also heard an interview of the three core band members from Stockholm about 3 weeks ago.The album is an eclectic mix of techno pop, shining brightest when showcasing the irresistible thumping dance rhythms. The overall experience brought back a certain frenetic dance energy I haven't felt in over 10 years. Overall, I am very glad I bought it. I expect it will be a hit at any party. Turn the volume up and let loose!The highlights for me are ""Cobrastyle"", ""Different Sound"", and ""Little Stereo."""
__label__2	My new favorite record: I saw these guys at Coachella last year and not only do they put on an amazing performance, there studio work is nothin short of superb. This is definitely an album you can put on and listen from track 1 until the very end and get into every minute! All my buddies are hooked!
__label__2	"Oh my gosh....: This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read."
__label__2	Very Different From Jaffe's Usual: The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book.
__label__2	Now I want to meet them: This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani & Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!
__label__1	"Hostel is better, but not by much.: i'll make my review short on this movie. it took 59 minutes to get to the ""good stuff"" and there wasn't much at that. you've seen all this before. no shock value here."
__label__1	"Great in theory....horrible in execution: They had a great idea with this film (despite clearly borrowing the concept from ""Hostel"")...a group of stranded tourists in Brazil are drugged and robbed and left with no alternative but to follow a ""friend"" into the jungle, ostensibly to have their organs sold on the black market, unbeknownst to them.What failed was just about everything from the horrible acting, to the gratuitous bikini-clad ""Hostel"" wanna-bees, to the implausibility of their situation and the fact that a horror film should actually be scary. Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it. If you like the idea behind the film, ""Hostel"" is a much better take on the could-it-really-happen-to-me-as-a-traveler-in-a-foreign-country horror film."
__label__2	Intense: I love how this movie shows the two extremes of Brazil; the beauty and the beast so to speak of touring a country that has extremely lovely beach and jungle areas, but also bleak areas of poverty where corruption and crime ruin lives. Great concept for a movie, and very well written and filmed in my humble opinion. I really appreciated the cave/water scenes, since they are often so difficult to do. The action gets intense, and some scenes are pretty gruesome (don't eat your dinner in front of this film if you have a weak stomach), but I really loved the story and acting. This is a tale that makes you 'think' about some of the horrid things going on in the world and the chain reaction of greed.Chrissy K. McVay - Author
__label__2	Hot women and freaky moments: I don't get why this movie isn't more popular. It's got a good cast, many hot women in little to nothing, and a slasher plot that's entertaining. I mean it's not a 5 star worthy movie, but what horror movie is? Stephen King's IT, maybe?
__label__2	Could Really Happen: A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better movie than Hostel. First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot. Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary. The acting is good, the tension and thriller elements are good and even the scenery is good. It is very gory though, so if you cannot stand the blood, get out of the jungle operating room.
__label__1	Stay far,far away from this garbage: This movie is so haorrible its not even funny.its very slow movie,the acting is bad,all of the good action takes place at the end and before you know it its all over before you got a chance to even enjoy it.if you are looking for this type of film watch any of the saw movies or the two hostel movie...all of which are better then this.trust me dont even rent this.i got it for $5.99 and felt cheated.a fair warning to all those considering this....DONT DO IT to yourself.
__label__1	2 stars for 2 scenes: 1 girl running off cliff and 1 girl still awake while being operated on (creepy).other than those scenes,its basically the son of hostel.
__label__1	Not a great movie!: I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
__label__1	It's like watching the show LOST!: Is it just me or did I feel like I was watching a missing episode of the show Lost? Just kiddin but anyways I thought it was a lil like the show Lost a bit but this movie was horrible. Do not watch it!
__label__1	Humbug!: This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Not my sort of thing, so I probably never should have bought it in the first place.
__label__2	Turistas: This turned out to be a really good movie! I actually saw this movie for sale in Blockbuster for $5 months ago, but after reading the description of it, chalked it up to being another edition of Hostel. Only recently when it came on cable did I realize that it is much, much better than Hostel.
__label__1	Just Awful: Horrible acting, worse plot...the only thing it has going for it is some good looking ladies, but even they can't make the film worth watching. Save 2 hours of your life and avoid this movie.
__label__2	Better than Hostel !! Check it out !: Surely, Hostel pushes gore into new level. But to be honest I think Turistas is slightly more realistic than Hostel. A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.If you like Hostel, this one is no brainer but even if you don't like Hostel, you may still like this one as this is better than HOSTEL.
__label__1	suckfest: if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring...
__label__1	Um....Hostel anyone?: This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such. I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel. This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares. This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick. The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable. I'm sorry I wasted my time.
__label__1	"horrible: this movie was just plain bad. bad story. bad ""gore"". bad everything. don't waste your money or your time watching this."
__label__1	"Trashstas!!!!!!!: For reasons I'll never understand, someone at work gave me this ""movie"" to watch because they said I would like it. WRONG,WRONG,WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is is just one long and sick snuff film of the lowest order. Many will like it but it really worries me that this disturbing thing is listed as Entertainment. Igrew up with slasher movies and they were call all kind of things in there time, but this one is truly just sick."
__label__1	Low Budget: Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans.
__label__2	"A good movie but not a horror film: If you're going to buy ""Turistas"" expecting to see a Hostel"" Eli Roth"" type film ...Your not going to,What you will see is a good, well acted, action packed movie with pretty people, beautiful scenery and some blood ""not much"" but the premise is not Horror it's more like the vacation from hell.Over all I liked this movie and recommend it for someone not looking for a hard core horror or gore film but just a good suspenseful action movie."
__label__1	"Um...NO.: Ok I hate to burst anyone's bubble about this movie...but it says on the cover ""A better and scarier movie than Hostel"". Um...NO. I actually enjoyed it up to the point where they got into the house and it got dark. From that point on the movie took place in nothing but darkness and you could not tell what was happeneing or who was who. So so annoying. This movie pissed me off. Don't waste your money. Thank god I only paid a few bucks for it. A complete waste of time. Eww."
__label__2	I love this movie, and josh jackson looks real good.: i liked the movie cuz the guy that was sayin all that stuff..forgot his name...the 1 with red hair...he reminds me of a friend, and i really enjoyed all 3 of the movies.
__label__1	"The Movie That Spawned An NHL Franchise: Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid's flicks. Well, it was good for what it was. I wouldn't watch it again though, it wasn't as memorable as ""The Sandlot"" or ""Goonies"" but it'll do."
__label__2	Hockey! We love Hockey!: This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie. If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!
__label__2	A Film From My Childhood: I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me. I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it. The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment. Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey. When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there. This film is a laugh a minute with childish humour that still makes me laugh now
__label__1	uhmmm: I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.
__label__2	young hockey fans: My 6 yr old grandson loves movies on my kindle fire--and hockey fans of all ages in our family love the mighty ducks. this movie is becoming a classic, plus ordering movies on kindle fire is fast and easy. we saw this movie in a theater years ago, and it is just as fresh and fast paced and as much fun on the small screen as it was in a movie theater. He and I watched this together, and laughed a lot.
__label__2	Good Family Movie: This movie had funny parts, and a good lesson for kids: Don't take your life too seriously, have fun once in a while. You win just by having fun.With that moral in mind, the movie is one that is appropriate for all ages. There is some mild mischief in the movie, but the language never crosses the mild PG range. If you enjoy goofy movies with a fun ending, this movie is for you.
__label__2	Good hockey movie: Good story line for a hockey movie. Fun for the kids to watch and always a good one to bring up when you are around high school hockey players. A movie that all kids have seen in their lives if they enjoy watching hockey.
__label__2	You don't have to know hockey: One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment.
__label__2	"Family-Friendly Hockey Fun: If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called ""The Bad News Bears on skates,"" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)"
__label__1	What Happened.: Ray J Ray j Ray j whats goin on this album is crap theres about 3 songs with good beats on em but ray j's vocals just screw them up. theres nothing great about this album or ray j.
__label__1	"What happened to this man?: I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."
__label__1	"Please make it stop!!!: I'm sorry but Ray J can't sing worth a damn. Everytime ""One Wish"" comes on the radio I have to change the station - it's too painful to listen to. I can't believe they let that one get past the studio...please make it stop!!"
__label__1	"Career Advice Ray J:Avoid a Recording Studio: aside from the Fact that I was only trying to get the Cut He did with R.kelly""Quit Actin"", I wasn't paying this cat no musical mind.Ray J is vocally tone challenged.he can't make up His Mind who is attempting to jack as a Singer.One Minute He wants some R.kelly,then Usher,Omarion,etc...Problem is dude ain't much of a Singer.so i was surprised to hear any Record Company was actually gonna give Him a solo deal.but anyway I got the song I wanted&tunned out the rest.maybe if He is lucky he can get a gig on the UPN network.wait a minute I heard he got something linned up well stick to it&stay out of the Music lab."
__label__2	Ray-J has grown up.....: I'm feeling this album. He has really stepped his game up a lot. The intro on the song is even hott.My favorites would have to be One wish, Keep sweatin',Lets play house, Melody, Sexy, Anytime, and What I need. The songs I didn't really care for are Unbelievable I don't like that song. Exotic I thought the song would be different. and War is over even though Rayj and Brandy collabos are usually hott I ain't feeling this song on this album.
__label__1	He's not quite there yet...: Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!
__label__1	"This is horrible: Out of the whole cd Ray J has just good song called ""One Wish"" the cd is a mixture of songs that don't make sense and he shouldn't be singing. I would not recomend this cd to anyone."
__label__1	If I had one wish...: Amazon would allow us to vote using negative stars. While we're on the subject of radiation, maybe chemotherapy would be less painful and traumatic then listening to this garbage.
__label__2	Ray J Stepped His Game Up: I don't care what anybody says this album is tight..Its a cd you can play from the beginning to the end..We all know Ray J does not have the best voice infact he can't sing at all, but give the man some credit he did his thang on this album..I don't get why it didn't sell cause in my opinion it should be on the top ten charts its very underrated..So if you wanna listen to some REAL r & b music then pick this album up.
__label__1	"WHY?: Ray J is not a thug... This as well as his image is all a FRAUD. It's insufferable listening to all his whining. Even R. Kelly's presence on ""Quit Actin'"" and Mya on ""Sexy"" are not enough to save this garbage. Ray J take a hint and ""Quit Actin'"" yourself and while you are at it stop singing too."
__label__1	"If i had one wish...: I'd make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. ""If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish..."". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song."
__label__1	"Pure Rated Garbage.(PRG): THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
__label__2	"The World Ain't Ready 4 Ray J: This album is one of Ray J's finest works. It's gritty and it's honest. His vocals are REAL. When you're a true artist you understand that making a song is not always about hitting the 'right note"". It's about the feeling behind the lyrics. The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview"" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience. Overall the album is worth every penny you spend because it sounds nothing like the regular mindless stuff you hear clogging up the airwaves today."
__label__2	I love it Ray J has soul!: I love this cd so much! hes really grown up hes only about a year older then me but hes still sexy and he can sing sing sing i love the majority of his cd i love blue high heels melody one wish and war is over featuring his sister brandy hes stepped his game up and hes not a little boy anymore so if you like rnb and good sounding music go out and cop this cd its a real slow jam banga! im lovin it! hes so so sexy now too hes grown up and i think his cd is underated by most people so if you like soul and rnb and hip hop all rolled into one you will love this cd i guarantee you'll be playing it on the regular i know iam! its one of my favorites! love it love it he has such a great vocal range and a great body too :-) so if you like soulful great fun love music get this cd and stop hatin on the brotha for makin some good tunes that you can really groove to cause im lovin it i give it all 5 stars!
__label__2	I knew!!!!!!: I knew he would do it. it is long over due for people to stop looking at Ray J as Brandy's little brother and as his own individual person i give this album five fat stars i like this whole cd but my favorite song is Melody and it's exactly about the title I love this song too because I am a singer too and I love music so i get where he is coming from this song is beautiful!!!!!!
__label__1	"Noise Pollution: Every time I hear that song ""One Wish"" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD."
__label__1	"Not worth it: And I only paid $23 for it. Thankfully the boys at Alternate Universe in Milford, CT are decent people and let me exchange it for a book of Krazy Kat.I'm a pretty huge fan of Spiegelman's work. I even have ""Breakdowns"", published in 1977, NOT 1997 like this book seems to believe!Aside from other errors, it was largely padded. He spent nearly a page explaining what the Holocaust was. Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's. It also was a fairly extensive summary of the history of comic art, but that's not exactly why a person would buy this book.Sorry Mr. Forget, but I was unimpressed."
__label__1	Not as described: Package says one size fits most queen...well what the heck is most queen because a 1x and a 3x are too different sizes, I am a 1x and this didn't fit over my curves.
__label__2	good stuff: the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
__label__2	Want more: An interesting experiment.Great subject, great acting, great sound.Too short however, and too short presence of my beloved Zara.Awaiting more...The DVD also contains beautiful interviews with Ian Hart, Stephen Lord and Elaine Cassidy (a delight for the fans of her.)[...]
__label__1	"Dead On Arrival: Normally, I would never buy anything from Harman Kardon. But this DVD player was on sell for $100.00 from $300.00. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. I set up the player and placed my first DVD in it. I knew I was in trouble when I hearding a whining, grinding sound. That wasn't too amusing. What was even less amusing was the nice blank TV screen. I tried another DVD just to make sure it wasn't a problem with the DVD. I got the same whining, grinding sound and blank TV screen.It wasn't worth mailing back, in either time or money. I went down to the local Best Buy and bought myself a nice Sony DVD player. It has been working great.I'm waiting to take my HK DVD player outside and re-enact the scene from ""Office Space"" where the guys beat the crap out of the printer. ;-)"
__label__2	The Most Understated Guitarist of our Time: Blues Saraceno is nothing short of a demi-god when it comes to musical genius. His approach to music in it's entirety is amazing to say the least. He has replaced my past favorites and now stands proud at the top. While he is fast as Vai and Satriani, his phrasing is majestic. His tone in unprecedented and unmatchable. Surprising to say, Saraceno cut all of these tracks in his own home studio at the ages of 16-23. You will understanding what I am talking about when you hear this albumn. BUY THIS CD!!! REVEL IN ITS BEAUTY!!! SPREAD THE WORD OF BLUES SARACENO!!!
__label__2	GREAT,GREAT,GREAT!!!!!: There should be a warning label cautioning drivers not to listen and drive. You'll get lost in the beat and end up with a ticket! FIVE STARS ISN'T ENOUGH !!
__label__2	"Magum's finest?: Magnum's ""Vigilante"" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!"
__label__2	"This could be the best yet...: In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
__label__2	Quiet Nights: Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves
__label__2	"Bebel Gilberto does it again!: Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best. After her previous releases I thought to myself ""Well it cant get better than this"" and while maybe I can't say she has improved this is still up there with the rest of her releases.Soft vocals over an almost African rhythm that just blend together so well. Yeh this is quality lounge music, this is music for the summer, long lazy days having a drink with friends, just being alone after a hard day or a long drive.Probably the only thing I dislike on this CD are when she sings in English. Give me that Portuguese any day!"
__label__2	Yet another solid collection...: I wouldn't be at all surprised if this release, Bebel's third, receives mixed reviews. Its flaw is that the first two tracks are the weakest songs on the cd- hard to believe, I know...(and the 2nd track is the supposed 'hit single'). But starting with track 3, Close to You, through til the end, it's consistently strong, varied material, closer in spirit to Bebel's 2nd release, Bebel Gilberto, than Tanto Tempo: more focus on Brazilian music than electronica (though admittedly 'Cade Voce' does recall the insipidness of the opening two tracks). That said, there's none of the soaring intensity as on Bebel Gilberto: Memento, by comparison, is a rather laid-back, understated affair. Um Segundo- entirely acoustic and recorded live in a studio in nyc- is one of a handful of standout tracks, reminding me of how much I'd love to be back in Bahia...
__label__1	"Disappointing: Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. Last two tracks (""Cade Voce"" and ""Words"")are almost noteworthy, but not quite! Save your money on this one unless your a collector. Oh well - maybe next time."
__label__1	A real disappointment: I stumbled upon Bebel at the bookstore with her first album. I rejoiced when I found a second and then when I listened to it could hardly keep myself away from it! If I had listened to this album first I would have dismissed Bebel immediately as not worthy of listening to. Her cut of Night and Day sounds like she is drunk and her instrumentalist joined in in the partying. There were a few good moments when the real Bebel seemed like she would make an appearance, but these quickly faded. I would not purchase a fourth CD without listening to it in its entirety first.
__label__2	Good album: Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music. Though personally this isn't my favorite album that she's made, however the songs Momento, Close to you, Azul, and Cade Voce in my opinion are more of the rare gems Bebel has added to her already popular arsenal of great Bossa Nova music. Any true fan of hers would be satisfied with her overall performance of this album. Keep it up Bebel!!!!!
__label__2	Ultra Force Field Jacket: The real deal. Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter. Field jacket, liner, and undersweater. 28 degrees and still comfortable. Great investment.
__label__2	Fabulous customer service: Gomadic brand product does the job and seems well made. The Gomadic web site which provided customer service was top notch. I either misplaced or didn't receive the exchangeable tip for the AC charger. When I let them know they were more than helpful and I had a new tip in my hands almost instantly. A singular experience for me and I buy online often.
__label__2	"The Teenage Tragedy Phenomenon: For some inexplicable reason teenage tragedy was a pop music phenomenon in the late Fifties and early Sixties and this single-disc collection hits all the highlights. ""Last Kiss"", ""Teen Angel,"" ""Endless Sleep,"" ""Tell Laura I Love Her,"" ""Patches"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" all went Top Ten, so apparently sad tales of adolescent woe weren't a detrement to chart success. The only real clunker here is the goofy parody ""Leader of the Laundromat."" [Surprisingly, that song went to No. 19, while ""Leader of the Pack"" was still on the charts.] If you like a good cry now and then--or just need to be reminded that not all pop hits were sunshine and rainbows--this album is for you. RECOMMENDED"
__label__1	An example of silly science fiction: Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight.
__label__1	Coffee Table Book - good for ideas but no plans or detailed design: If you're looking for a finnish fireplace design book, look on. This is a picture book showing how a finnish fireplace design can fit into home decor, containing not any plans or technical information. Disappointing.
__label__1	"Not DVD Quality: I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up. In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light. It gets very annoying. There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie."
__label__1	Meh...I've had better.: I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality.
__label__2	Quality: This is a quality product. Brio puts out a great wooden train track. They are wooden, well made and have held up to many years of use at our home.The more different sizes and items you have for your track the more your track can change from a simple circle to a large fun track. We have several sets of these to play with at our home.I would probably buy these after I have bought some of the extension kits with the more specialized track pieces and after I had some of the smaller pieces available for purchase.Well worth the money.Enjoy.
__label__1	Thomas the Train tracks: This is a good product, but highly over-priced. $10 for FOUR pieces of track ???????
__label__1	"Not Moorcock's Best: Blood is a book that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Sadly it never focuses on any one of them long enough to become interesting. Too many elements seem to have been tossed in without having any impact on the story, stretching suspension of disbelief beyond all bounds. The attempt at ""non-linearity"" simply creates a jumble that, while ultimately having a certain underlying logic, is not a very entertaining or engrossing read."
__label__1	"Mediocre: I have been reading Moorcock's work ever since I encountered his creations while playing RPGs in the early Nineties. Suffice it to say, Moorcock seems to have nothing more to add to his Chaos-spawned mythology other than an obviously mediocre book. Old hands will probably notice the allusions to the Eternal Champion, a concept which in all the circumlocutions ,Alas! almost put him at par with those lame ""formula writers"". His Blood just fails to churn mine."
__label__2	Great Value Priced CD: Saw a TV Show not long ago with the Everly Brothers in concert and hadn't really ever though much about them, they were before my time. However, really liked them and I couldn't get the song, (Till) I Kissed You, out of my head. So I bought the CD for my girlfriend, come to find out they have a lot of songs that we liked and had heard, but never really paid that much attention too and didn't know that they sung them. It's a great CD for the money, but I do hate the Eco-Friendly Packaging.
__label__2	"The BEST Everly Brothers album you will ever need,: Long ago in californialand, i heard the last everly brothers ""hit"", on the wings of a nightingale, 1 time and i knew I HAD to have it. Took me about 20 years to find it, in this album. If you really like good music, with tight harmonies, good guitar work, words you can understand, a little bit of country and early rock to the still bitchin, fresh,updated sound of nightingale, then STOP RIGHT HERE and get this album. Enough said!"
__label__2	Everly Brothers: These brothers were early rock favorites of the teenage crowd - a kinder, gentler time. Most teens today would consider them boring, but their messages are still relevent, just to a younger group. I still love their music, and you can actually understand every word they say. Very catchy tunes, and even my granddaughters will play their cds occasionally (they're early twenties). I recommend this cd because it has all their best songs on it.
__label__2	NBA 2k3 VS NBA 2003!!!!: Unlike the other reviewers, i'll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. I got BOTH!GRaphic-NBA2003 had better graphics, smoother movement and brighter textures.Sound-NBA2k3, cuz of ESPN!!!Value-2k3 hands down. I don't know why... but it last longer. and Online Play nuff said....Gameplay- 2003 is more casual friendly, which means even if you're not into Basketball you could still find some fun here. And with their innovative Freestyle right joystick control, its deffinitly funner.While 2003 could be funner for a shorter amount of time, 2k3 is the real winner if you took your time for Seasons.... Which one's better is really a matter of taste.
__label__2	2K3: This is the same as playstation2 verison i love all ov the 2K's this has better graphics then playstation2 but this is a good gane overall.
__label__2	Sega Sports Rules: Best basketball game out there...most realistic, challenging and fun...street games are a great addition
__label__1	"Don't believe the hype.: The reason i bought this game was beause of all the great reviews from here and game web sites. All i hear was it's the best B-ball sim out there. Well that's a bunch of BS. I don't know how many times playing as kobe, Shaq, Iverson etc.. i've gotten my shot blocked (even on fade aways) by a bench player. As shaq i get a miss match with a 6foot guard so i try backing him down and well i can't. It seems shaq isn't strong enough to plow his way through a 6 footer lol. And when i make him spin to the basket then press shoot 9 times out of 10 he doesn't go for the dunk instead he throws up some off balance,fade away crazy looking shot. The gameplay is challenging but not in a good way. I guess i will try ""NBA Live""."
__label__1	A complete piece of junk: This piece of equipment is aweful. It doesnt work period. Just look at the tech support webpage from ADS an be your own judge.
__label__1	Piece of grabage - STAY AWAY!: I have about 20 hours invested in this thing. It DOES NOT WORK!I am running a new install of XP on a new Pentium 4.The only good thing about this package is the third party Ulead software that is included. As for the ADS software, I continue to get errors when I try to playback video:ADSTech CapWiz Application has encountered a problem and needsto close... This is the second PC I have tried to install this on, and it is the same story. I have followed the instructions over and over again. What a waste of time and money!
__label__1	Does not work properly, COMPANY NO HELP: The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn't work properly. While converting: I am getting interference from the unit on both the TV and computer (which shows up on the copy), there is a 1/8 inch distortion at the bottom of the preview screen (also shows up on the copy), and the sound is not in sync. I tried to contact the company by phone and left messages instructed with no call back from them. Sent an email to tech support that went unanswered too. Finally contacted someone at the company, explained my problems, returned the unit as per instructions for repair, received it back after 3 weeks and it still doesn't work. Contacted tec support again and was told to download updated program(I had the latest version installed) did so anyway without any better results. My suggestion is to pass on this unit.
__label__1	Problems with drivers and Syncing - Don't Buy: Drivers for XP gave trouble. Had fewer problems with Win ME.However, this baby has problems syncing sound and video. Check all forums on the web, this is a problem everyone has.Doesn't look like ADS is about to fix it any time soon.A definite DON'T BUY.
__label__1	bad: Not happy with this product lots problems!!!Not work at all for me. Had a person who is computer nam look at it and everything. He not get it either.
__label__2	ADS works fine...1st time: I had few problems installing these units on two different PC's. The CAPWIZ is somewhat flakey (V2.0) at timesand requires exiting and reentering the CAPWIZ program.I found this utility to work the best with the unit inplace ofthe Video Studio. Unit does a fine job in the capture process andcreates a presentable MPEG1 (SVCD,MPEG1,MPEG2)..I Found VCD resolution encoding to be less than ideal,
__label__1	Good piece of hardware, C+ software, terrible tech support: This product is a good idea. However, the software is not easy to use. Unless you have a very powerful PC, and get installation right the first time, you'll be in trouble. Included documentation is of little help and Tech support is a dead end (not to mention arrogant).
__label__1	Not for XP: I have a 1.7gig P4 running XP and found this product to be very unstable which is a nice way to say it doesn't work. The hardware would always hang my computer no matter which software I used with it. Also a note to their clueless tech support, my Maxtor hard drive was the cause for the sound and video being out of sync, when I reinstalled XP using a Western Digital drive the sync problem went away but not the instability. Believe Microsoft when they say use of an unsigned driver may make your system unstable.
__label__1	Worst ever: I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. This is neither instant nor is it DVD. It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy.
__label__1	Instant Piece of [junk] is more like it: I was unable to get the driver for Win XP Pro to work. When I had problems I went back, erased my drive and did a clean install of Win XP, twice. The second time I was very careful about the order in which I loaded the driver, but to no avail. The applications that came with it kept hanging and never worked. Instant DVD is a total piece of [junk]. I regret wasting this much time on a product that does not seem to have been tested with Win XP. I contract this with Pinnace's product. I installed Pimmance PCTV Pro and it was easy to install and works like a charm.
__label__1	USBAV-700 Software Wouldn't Load: Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly. E-mail to company went unanswered, except for auto reply. Phone numbers were always busy. Returned the unit to the store of purchase for a refund.
__label__2	Wonderfully inspirational!: If you've ever wondered *what if* about a past love, this is the book for you!! A GREAT read!!!
__label__2	"Bravo!: Though some of the works here are better than others, such as ""Milagro"", and ""The Integral"", Ms. Pita offers enough of a variety with a master's stroke that most tastes will be satisfied."
__label__2	Snapped right into my 03 Accord: This is a pretty good product. It fit nice and tight in the doors of my 2003 Accord without having to drill any holes. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to do some customization to get a tight seal around the speakers (5 1/4 in).
__label__1	This one's a loser: Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice.
__label__1	not that much of a heartache .,: When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it. This is the second book in the all-girl brands series it 's not as good,it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can't feel a whole lot of empathy for the character.THE HEROINE IS JUST SELF CENTRED AND BORING AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HERO SEE'S IN HER BESIDES THE FACT SHE IS A MODEL THE HERO DESERVED BETTER.
__label__2	A comidy thriller: Jessie Woods,my great great Aunt, has had such a wonder and histerical life. Her facinating stories of her early life as a wing walker, have been put in a book that couldn't of been written any better. I would recomend this book to any one who is looking for a good laugh and some teeth gripping tales o walking on the wing.
__label__2	Grat book!: A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
__label__1	This is the worst hockey game!!: This is the worst hockey game made for this season. This game looks like it was made in the eighties! I rented Hitz and the gave me this by accident. I played it for about twenty minutes and i was so disgusted I didn't touch it again. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone except as a very last resort. After a bout five minutes of playing I had counted three animation glitches and five sound ones. This game was so horrible my family who doesn't know much about games even thought it was horrible. I have been to three rental stores and four different department stores and the highest and the highest anyone gave it was 4/10.

__label__1	"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd: The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library ""Prepared by HP"". It is ""an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages."" My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99."
__label__1	waste of money and time: I bought this cd and have been disappointed from day one. First of all, there are only 200 questions per section (5 sections) which means you will be through this cd in less than a weeks time....you'd be better off buyng the book set instead. As well, when you take the mock exams you will soon discover that they have cut corners once again and have recycled questions from the previous sections into the exam. This does not test your knowledge, it tests your ability to memorize. When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong, but be careful because once you quit the cd, all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again! All in all, i was thoroughly dissapointed with my purchase and would have been better off without it. By the way, i haven;t even written my board exam, so i am not blaming this cd for poor exam results...yet!
__label__1	Couldn't get it.: I got no traction at all in this book. Was counting on a friend who also bought it and, sadly, his reaction was the same. I'm going to take another run at it.
__label__1	Two discs won't play.: Discs 6 and 11 won't play. Big damaged spots, you can see through the discs. Humbly request replacement or refund.
__label__1	"Ick!: I was expecting the author to continue with some Dickensian darkness and magical whimsey. The darkness was certainly delivered...and with heaping doses of vulgarity to boot. A dry read most certainly NOT reminiscent of the tone of ""A Christmas Carol""--as one is led to expect by the book's abstract--I stopped reading it after the fourth chapter and haven't missed it at all!"
__label__2	Very imaginative and mysterious: Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read.
__label__2	"Brilliant: I read this book over the summer and it was so good that I kept putting it down as I didn't want it to end! Dicken's ""Tiny Tim"" is now all grown up at 23 in 1860 and is living in a London brothel, where he teaches the mistress how to read and write in exchange for board. He discovers three dead girls that have died in an unusual way, and he sets out to find out how and why. Include a colourful cast that includes a street urchin and an Italian orphan, and you've got yourself a fantastic, brilliant read. It is easily one of the best books I've ever read."
__label__1	avid reader: BORING. this book should have been a short story. i am shocked that people liked it so much.
__label__1	"Tiny Tim in Adulthood: Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
__label__1	one of the worst: This book was one of the worst I have ever read. I thought it was going to be inspiring on the life of Tiny Tim from The Christmas Carol story. Instead, it was raunchy, and totally boring. Shame on the reviewers who lured our book club with their praise of this book for the Christmas season. Couldn't even finish it - and I have never not finished a book in over 30 years. Blah!
__label__1	Disappointing: Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back. I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting.
__label__2	Couldn't put it down: Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. As a character, Mr. Timothy is drawn with a complexity that defies prediction of his actions. The two children he partners with feel true, with the charm and courage that Dickens gave the children he wrote about. One cares what happens to all of them, and I assure you, much does happen. I found myself savoring the last few chapters, dreading that time when I would reach the back cover and part company with this fascinating group.
__label__1	"not really a memorable story: I read this book a couple of months ago and I cannot remember much about the book, it being totally forgetable. Mr. Timothy could be Mr. Fred. There wasn't much of a point to him being ""Tiny Tim"" - just a plain old story. A big disappointment."
__label__2	Pea Pod Babies: The book was in great condition and it is a great story, but the seller neglected to include that their was a personal note inside the cover.
__label__2	The Dutchman: I enjoy history and this historical fiction was terrific. Having grown up in the NYC area, I found the historical aspects very informative. The plot was complex but engaging. After reading this book by Maan Myeyers, I went on to read the entire series. A very good read and I recommend it.
__label__1	"Wrong Poster: The poster I received is okay - it's the one with ""Planet Earth"" written in italics along the bottom, instead of EARTH - but I really would have preferred the one I chose to spend money on, especially since you can buy the one I mistakenly got for .83 instead of $5ish. However, the shipping was fast and the poster was spotless."
__label__1	Wrong Poster: They sent a similar but incorrect poster, that is only about half as cool. It was missing the NASA sign in the upper left corner as well as the Earth Solar System lettering. Instead there was the words planet Earth written in Italics and a number of fake stars added to the background. The picture of Earth was the same, but the rest of this poster just doesn't compare to what is shown here.
__label__2	RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW: IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.
__label__2	Glad I finally found it!: I remember watching this on TV and taped it them. Somewhere along the way I lost the tape and finally found it on here. It is a FANTASTIC show!!! A must have for anyone...no caveats, just anyone who likes music!
__label__2	Ricky Martin is the best: Ricky Martin is the best don't ... Ricky has a great voice and his songs are very well written. And he's very handsome too!
__label__1	doesn't work if you wear glasses: You look thru a pin-hole to get the sighting, but you can't see thru the pinhole if you wear glasses. If you take your glasses off then you can see thru, but if you're near-sighted like me then you won't be able to see very far in the distance to tell what you're sighting.
__label__1	"Huh?: I have never given a movie 1 star before but here it is. ""Woman in the Fifth"" offers very little in the way of plot or relevancy for that matter. The characters are flat, dull, and the dialog is less than inspiring. This movie is about nothing, literally. There is no back story of any characters, no motivation for their actions or lack there of, nothing. Just nothingness. And then it ends thankfully."
__label__1	Enigmatic and moody and pointless and poo: Save your money and time. This is nonsense attempting to be arty and important. I'd also forgotten how dire an actor Hawke is. Save your time? There is no explanation or direction. Honey Boo Boo has better writin.
__label__1	Not happy. Read the book. Much better.: Very disappointed by this movie. The book was great and so I anticipated the movie would be as well, especially after seeing who was going to star in the movie.Very disappointed. Slow moving movie - lots missing...
__label__1	They should have stayed in the fourth.: I was attracted to this movie by the stars. I have not read the book, but I view movies on the basis of a perceived entertainment value. Unfortunately, this one is not very entertaining, nor is it very believable, even as a so-called psychological drama. It's the first time I've ever been disappointed by Kristen Scott Thomas. Save your money.
__label__1	Stine: I have been using Exuviance products for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied and feel I have found my skin care products that I intend to use for the future. But, unfortunately I had a bad experience when I ordered the products from Amazon.com(through a dealer called Impossible Discounts)- Rejuvenating Treatment Masque, Hydrating Eye Complex and Clarifying Facial Cleanser. All three products were dirty and did not come with any outer box or sealing. Actually, the products looked used! I have sent this complaint to Exuviance, but have not got any reply and now it is two months since I sent the complaint.. I am afraid that I will not buy Exuviance again nor buying at Amazone again after this incident.
__label__2	Cheap backup: There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap
__label__2	Handy, or better yet heady flashlight.: If you want your hands to be free, use your head. When I crawl under a desk to connect a computer, now I can see what I am doing and use the glowing screen on my cell phone to make calls and not cast a blue haze on the cables. Works well when I am in the wiring closet (by myself) now I have light were I need it and two hands free.
__label__2	Interfaith Symbol Charm: The order came in a timely manner, It was in perfect condition. I was greatly please with the service and the product.
__label__1	a minor book on the everest tragedy: lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the book is choppy and doesn't grip you like some other books.if you have all the other everest books go ahead and get it but you'll enjoy 'high exposure by breashears and climb by anatoli b. much better
__label__1	"wrong category !: This is not a book about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a book about mt. Everest; this book is about ms. Gammelgaard proving to herself ""she could be the first nordic woman to set foot"" on Chomolungma - big deal ! So maybe you can call this a tale of a driven, achieving lady who singlemindedly pursues a goal, but you will learn nothing about what happened in may, 1996 or about what being on mt. Everest is like; not even close to Krakauer's or Boukreev's books on the same topic: buy those instead."
__label__1	"SAVE YOUR MONEY: If you feel you are interested in reading this book I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter. Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a ""Mountain Climber"" would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend ""tip-toes"" each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was ""tip-toeing"" to, with the ""sexy green underware"" she speaks of in her book. Hmm?The book has nothing to do with Mountain Climbing if that is what you are interested in."
__label__1	"BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL: As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
__label__1	Self-absorbed garbage: Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money.
__label__1	"This book is not worth your money. Don't Buy.: This book, like a lot of this summer's ""blockbuster"" movies, enjoyed a major build-up. It did not live up to its hype. It was full of ego and ultimately left me wondering why I bothered to finish it."
__label__1	"Just an attempt to cash in on the '96 trajedy.: Everything that needs to be said was said in ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb."""
__label__1	"Yawn! Wake me up at the end.: I was excited to come across Lene Gammelgaard's book as I love to read about women who share my taste for adventure. Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has ""been a journalist,"" unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing."
__label__2	The most powerful account of Everest I have ever read.: It's about time the world heard a woman's account of the 1996 Everest tragedy. Ms. Gammelgaard delivers the most poignant and moving account to date. Unlike her male counterparts, she is not afraid to delve deeply into her psyche and emotions and shares with the reader her inspiring perspective of Everest and of the greater world we live in.
__label__2	Excellent perspective from a member of Scott Fischers' team: A refreshing account of the 96 Mountain Madness Everest expedition from a women who must command respect from the mountaineering world. This book is an inspiration to those who follow their dreams, and go beyond just setting goals in life, regardless of what that may be. A MUST read for anyone who's read Into Thin Air, The Climb, or The Other Side of Everest. I'd recommend catching one of her bookstore appearances as well!
__label__1	Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness?: I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it.
__label__1	"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,: The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
__label__1	A badly written book!: The author came across as a rather selfish and arrogant person, totally self involved. There were enough problems up there on Mt. Everest without Gammelgaard throwing temper tantrums because Scott Fischer wanted her to summit with oxygen. She frequently drew conclusions about other's thoughts and motivations without any basis for these judgements. The writing was boring, choppy, and unedited for grammar. Hopefully, Gammelgaard did get around to paying Mountain Madness the balance of what she owed them. She tried to convince us that she did in fact pay in full. Not true. Frankly, the woman has difficulty in relating the facts with truthfulness. I could never recommend a book this poorly written. She didn't really write about mountain climbing. She wrote more about love of self. Her own self, that is.
__label__1	Stick with Krakauer!: What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one.
__label__1	"All About Lene: After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"
__label__1	"A Major disappointment: Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
__label__1	"Boring and shallow!: There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than ""we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm."" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."
__label__1	"Self-indulgent drivel: I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the ""inner game"" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."
__label__2	Cosmological Eye: I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human.
__label__2	We love it- a must have!!: My daughter watches this daily and loves it just as much every time. I enjoy it alot as well. If you have an Elmo fan in your world, this comes with the most recommendations!!!!!!!
__label__2	helps children feel less afraid: My daughter who is a huge Elmo fan enjoyed this DVD. She was very sympathetic when Elmo was afraid, but now points out every fire truck, tells me why the firefighters wear their boots, hat and jacket, and can stop, duck and go.
__label__1	Too Scary for Younger Tots: While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children.
__label__2	"My son's absolute favorite!: We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son's second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home. He would wake up in the morning and beg, ""Elmo Firetruck House?"" He learned all about firefighters and firetrucks. We bought him a firetruck and hat for his birthday and he plays with them while watching this dvd. The firefighters in the video are actual firefighters, and they did a great job of teaching what to do in a fire. We all love this one!"
__label__2	"Very Educational!: I have two year old twin girls who are absolutely mesmorized by this film, every day they insist on watching it, and have learned how to handle situations involving a fire without even realizing it. They both claim they want to be fire fighters so they can ""put out the fire in Hooper's Store"". I highly reccomend this movie to any parent wanting to teach their child about fire safety."
__label__1	Scared Stiff: My son's day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. He is 2 1/2 years old. He still is concerned most days as we pull in the driveway that they will show it again.
__label__1	Not Actually Available: Tried to watch this using our ROKU (we've watched other amazon content this way), but when you try to watch, it says content not available. Annoying since the easiest way to search is online. Back to the search.
__label__1	Too boring: My one year old loves 5 of the Sesame Street DVDs we ordered for her. This one however was a total dud. There wasn't much here to keep a kid's interest and the educational value was marginal at best. Look elsewhere.
__label__1	Bad job!: I bought this video thinking that it would be a great tool to teach about fires. Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part. They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job.
__label__1	Poor quality: The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying. I would look else where for a piano DVD.
__label__2	Very good DVD, better than watching Barney reruns over and over.: The video is very good, it is cartoon characters which really kept my 5 year old engaged. I think the information is a little bit complex, but in my case that is a good thing because I dont want him to master the DVD the first time he watches it. I think it is great for what it is, I only wish they had a larger series covering more about the subject. I will have to say the materials on the DVD are very catchy, and my son loves watching it. There is also some song choices at the end. 30 minutes is a bit short, but it seems longer wit the menu of all the songs at the end. There really is nothing else out there like this from what I can see.
__label__2	Very Good Western: Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher combine their talents once again to make an exciting western/civil war movie.Scott is ask to leave his Civil War duties back east to run a stageline full time to deliver gold to the union.The transfer from the Warner Archive line is beautiful. Very crisp and colorful.All-in-All gets a B+ from me.
__label__2	A good, traditional western: This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc.), but still a very good one (4,5!). Scott is always good. He is so natural that one does not give enough credit for his acting. There are a lot good actors in this film though my favorite Virginia Mayo does not have very much to do. The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great.
__label__1	Disappointed: This book basically gives you the history of words and how they were established. It was not what I was looking for! Not a good read!
__label__1	Vocabulary Extender: Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Just a poor attempt at a primer.
__label__2	Vocab Builder: Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a book of this nature on hand, literally.
__label__1	Not up to HD standards: This game is poor - not realistic for anyone that rides a Harley. The game uses keystroke only - no joystick or wheel, and the sound doesn't resemble any Harley I ever heard, including my own. I can't believe HD let Activision use their name for this game.
__label__2	"Simple fun stress relief: This is definitely an arcade-type game. It has simple left-right steering controls, accelerate, brake, etc. It is shameless Harley Davidson promotion with H-D road signs showing up every mile or so, and cheesy 80's rock (Poison, I think), but is a LOT OF FUN.You can ride up to your opponents, kick them off their bikes, hit turbo boost to go really fast, and you gain points to buy better bikes and equipment.After playing so many ""simulators"" out there which just succeed in making me more tired after a long work day, this is simple, relaxing fun. Rock on!"
__label__2	A Master Teacher!: Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed.
__label__2	great cd: Probably ostaras best release to date. Containing elements of neo folk,goth rock,post punk and and numerous other elements..ostara stand apart from most neo folk acts in the vocals..much more poppy and happy sounding. The whole cd has a warm, inviting sound that demand heavy rotation.
__label__2	awsome: this was great i got the product earlier then i expected and it was in the exact condition that was stated on amazon. When i go to buy more movies i will deffinitly be going through the same group :D
__label__2	PERFECT!!: I absolutely love this series and I am so excited to have it! It's great to be able to watch all your favorite episodes... and even the ones you missed :O . It is a wonderful addition to my collection and I can't wait for future seasons.
__label__2	CSI continues to bring the detective side out of you.: After becoming addictive to the CSI series, I just can't seemto get enough. So I purchased the third complete series to geton with the excitement and I couldn't stop.Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotionsand perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And WarrickBrown returns to his oldneighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.All in all, if you're into CSI: Las Vegas, you'll enjoy thisseason as mush as 1 and 2.
__label__1	no sale: The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. I think this is kind of strange, considering one of the characters is going deaf.
__label__1	"Grainy, CC only with WMP: This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a ""play all"" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I've been able to pop a disk out of."
__label__1	worng order: okay so there is no 23 episodes. the seller only gave me a disc with 3 episodes. what a scam? don't buy from this person again.
__label__1	"Season Three Lacking: Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons. The episodes are tired and formulaic, and the ""surprise"" season finale is laughable. Continuity is thrown out the window and the storylines are fractured. Buy the first and second seasons to see the best of CSI."
__label__2	CSI CONTINUES TO SHINE: Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self. We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more. The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television. Brilliant show just keeps getting better!
__label__2	csi: was received faster than expected with package undamaged and in great shape..was so happy it got here in time to give as a christmas gift..will buy from again
__label__2	ok: it was good. one of the dvd's glitched after a while of playing. the screen froze and wouldn't play. the dvd's were dirty. i cleaned them up and seemed to work fine. so overall it was ok.
__label__2	High Quality CSI: DVD boxed set of CSI season 3, very high quality video for a DVD. Hardly notice the difference when playing back on a HDTV. 5.1 surround sound does not really work well for a TV series, sometimes the dialogs are softer than the background or effects making the story quite hard to understand, especially when there is no subtitles to go along.
__label__2	Fun Show..but....: CSI is just one fine TV series, though it can go from engrossing the viewer to grossing the viewer out with some of its all-too-ugly scenarios. Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?
__label__1	"Gotta Be There: I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and ""gotta be there"". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again."
__label__2	we love it: My 5 year old and I play this game. Its really cute, and theres a ton of stuff to do. 15 different levels and good graphics. my son loves the sound of taz burping an extra big burp but thats about as icky as it gets. All in all a good game.
__label__2	Kind of: Taz wanted is a really cool game, because it has a lot of things that have to be done. You can unlock mini games and see many levels. You also get to fight bosses like tweety, sam, daffy duck and a huge elefant. The sound is great because it gives life to the game. The game is filled with secreat passways and catchers who will try to catch Taz. The only bad thing about this game is that the colors are so bright that they could give you a headache and taz MOVES SO MUCH that you could get dizzy. Also at first, the posters will not be so eassy to find and destroy, but you must keep trying.(...)P>Good Luck!!!
__label__1	Not so hot: I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right. And if you get motion sick easily...well, Taz pretty much spins a lot. Enough said!
__label__2	Enjoyable: Vanessa-Mae is a talented musician. The songs are varied going from classical to popular to standards. It's very enjoyable.
__label__2	The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae: While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them.
__label__1	"not bad for a cheap knife!: cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
__label__2	"Very good, but...: Peter Turchin's ""Quantitative Analysis of Movement"" is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns. Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques. Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared. Turchin is kind enough to provide a special appendix, ""Diffusion for Ecologists,"" for those with relatively weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself). Not easy to understand but well worth the effort."
__label__1	Disappointed: I didn't even get a chance to play the game because it instantly crashed my computer; the CD was dirty outside when i got it, I'm very disappointed.
__label__1	I must be on something: I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened.
__label__1	This is not what I was looking for: Why are they still selling this? Worth a laugh, but the feature is 30 minutes long and I bet your laugh won't last all the way to the end.
__label__2	SIMON SAYS: GORE!!!: Just watched this on FearNet and will definitely buy this on dvd! I love crappy, gorey, over the top films and while it breaks no ground it harkens back to the beloved films of the 1980's that throw away plot and logic for gore gags and fun. Crispin Glover is great as Simon and this movie delivers on all levels. Fans of the original Mother's Day, Texas Chainsaw 2 and others of this ilk will enjoy this. I am not saying it is as good them, but good for a chuckle and midnight rewatching. Recommended!
__label__1	Why Cripsin? Why?: This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it
__label__2	Crazy In the Woods: You must buy this film, It is one of the best horror films that Ive seen in the last couple of years...Stanley & Simon are brothers & well they like to hunt & kill ......
__label__1	"stinker: The premise of the movie is nothing new but the acting was horrible. The worst part being Simon's accent. I got so annoyed everytime he would open his mouth and say ""You didn't say Simon says""....The rest of the characters were rather flat...the cheating boyfriend, the best friend cheating with the boyfriend, the stoner and ect. Also, all the flying axes get a little old after the first few times. What I wanted to know was how he could set them all up so quickly...?? The final showdown was odd and cheesey. All things considered it was a very lame and boring movie."
__label__1	"Disappointing: I am still new to the horror movie genre, and maybe I'm a noob at this. But, seriously the movie is nowhere near good. Crispin Glover does what he does best, I can recognize his psychotic face from a mile away and still run like hell. But, the story line and the graphics quality was disappointing. The first few minutes watching the movie I thought ""This is not going to go well"" but then I realize the name Blake Lively on the cover and was relieved. ""Thank goodness"" I said, but then I sat through the whole movie only to see Blake enter 5 minutes in the end saying a few lines, looking hot as usual, and capiche. End of movie."
__label__1	"Not worth it.: I like Crispin Glover and i am a huge horror and genre fan, but this movie was weak, really weak. I like movies sometimes that are bad, because they are bad in a way that is funny or even enjoyable. This was a movie that was bad and after it was over I say ""I just wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was) of my life on this crap!"""
__label__1	truly awful.: crispin glover completely ruins this movie. had a pretty good yet uninspired plot....but still decent enough to stick with...UNTIL about half way through and you seriously cant take him anymore....this movie could of been a ton of fun but ended up truly sucking.
__label__2	Brief but Useful Introduction: I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs.
__label__2	Don't let it join itself together again!: This is a present for my nephew. I don't see anyeducational value to this game. I used to play thisgame in the arcade. It is a lot of fun. You have tobe quick enough to not let the worm join itself back.Keep you hands on the trigger. Blast away!Enjoy!
__label__2	Filled with objective and factual information for Christians: Equip yourself with this handbook of New Age facts, doctrines, comparisons, and rebuttals. This manual will help you educate the precious souls that are being blinded by the dangerous New Age movement. Learn the difference between the Jesus they preach, and the Jesus we know.
__label__1	Introduction to New Age Cults: A very brief but necessary introduction for those who don't know but would like to know just a little of what's happing with what is called the New Age Occultism. This well know author of many books in this area introduces the fresh reader to people, topics, and a short glossary, and history to the ever present New Age Occultism, along with the latent dangers of this religious movement.
__label__1	The New Age Cult: Save your money, i'm not sure whats more disturbing the fact that a doctor wrote this garbage or that people will probably believe him.
__label__1	the item i got is broken: dear sir,i tried to contact you many times ,regarding this itemwhen i opened the box the faucet handle was broke and i can send you pictures if neededregardshaj hasanmohamad.hajhasan@gmail.com
__label__2	Good enough for what it claims: The people who have written reviews primarily have gripes that they didn't pass. They must have thought the book was THE ONLY RESOURCE they would need. I used this book and I did pass the exam. It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched. Remember to buy the version that applies to your test year.
__label__1	DISAPPOINTED: It is the worst book I have ever seen.I passed both CFA and AICPA and familarize with those materials. I still find it difficult to follow. Not clear explaination, contradiction among arguments and wrong answers for the sample questions.I am very disappointed.
__label__1	How not to write a book: I bought this book to write the FRM exam. It is the worst possible written book that I have ever seen. Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment. I wonder if anybody at GARP ever reviewed it before recommending it as a text for the FRM exam.
__label__1	The Worst risk management book: It is the worst risk management book I have ever read. Poor organization and explanation, make the matter difficult to be understood. It is a very disappointing book suggested by GARP. I am a CFA charter, I have good knowledge in most of the subjects, I still think difficult in reading this book because of its poor explanation.
__label__1	Hope this book is not representative of GARP's credibility: Is there anything less than 1 star? For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?
__label__1	Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation?: As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning.
__label__1	I Wish I Hadn't: This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials.
__label__1	Riddled With Errors: This book is sloppy and riddled with errors. Coverage of topics is uneven. The author delves into some subjects but tap dances around others. You don't need this book for the FRM. I don't recommend it.
__label__1	Regret to buy this book: Many reviewers have commend that this book is poor in organization and explanation, I don't want to repeat. But one thing I would like to remind the potential buyers that this book includes all the past exam questions of FRM. I believe that it is the only attractive point of this book.But the explanation of the answers of the past questions are also not very good.
__label__1	Lots of errors: This book is misleading. Contains impressive amount of errors, that leads readers to learn wrong concepts. I am starting to doubt that this book was written by a Phd. Or if it was, then lets revoke his title. Hope they release some decent review on this.
__label__1	Redundant and Too Expensive: This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff. The message seems to be that, if you can't make sense of his first book, you should shell out $100 to give him a second chance. Save your money. It is not worth it.
__label__2	XO PRO CUP WITH SUPPORTER: What can one say about protection for ones family jewels....Not only does the job that is intended but also is relatively comfortable, if that can actually be said about such things. The cup is very hard where it needs to be but as it tapers down ones body it softens up and becomes flexible so you can chase after baseballs without pulling hairs. All in all a great deal for a super price, not expecting to have to be in the market for one again, but would buy this same model again!
__label__2	"Stop the Whining! This Album Rules: Just shut your traps for a moment. It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made ""Dimension Hatross"" a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, ""Negatron"" is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace."
__label__1	"Voivod sounding like Exodus?: I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
__label__2	Recent Purchase: The book I ordered was exactly as described and delivery was even faster than promised.
__label__2	Looks great in my Craftsman home.: I still have a few original push button switches in my 1918 house. These wall plates look great. I'm very happy with my purchase.
__label__1	"Dopey: The title of this book is extremely misleading.It's packed full of stupid things like ""medicine ball biceps curls,"" ""triceps extensions,"" ""good mornings,"" etc... These are not plyometric exercises! Basically it's an excuse to use a medicine ball for classic weight lifting moves.Combined with this are some very basic throwing moves, of which I was hoping for more of.The drawings are of course crude stick figures, and the directions are weak.I'm returning this book.A little imagination will go a longer ways than this book."
__label__2	Best book on plyometric exercises from the best expert.: This is a great book.There are pictures that illustrate everything clearly.Buy this with an Amazon.com medicine ball and you can do a full workout in your home or office.
__label__2	Irish traditional folktales with wit, humor and light.: The book is appealing on many levels. It has fantasy,mystery, myth and abundant humor. Most of the tales aremythical in nature. Some are fabricated tall tales.The writing is excellent, with rich detail expressed interse language. A delight from cover to cover.
__label__1	"Great book, bad product: The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase ""L"".Find another printing."
__label__1	"Great story, no full color prints: I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig ""twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie"".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under ""illustrations"", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the ""River City Press 1978 reprint"""
__label__1	don't use this book for a class: The soft back edi- tion of this book is full of misedit- ed copy (full of sep- arated text (annoying isn't it?). It also does not have the publication date or a full title page. I wrote a report using the date of 2006 because that was the only date I could find. Lastly, whole portions of text are missing from this edition. My advice, spend the extra money and get a different edition.
__label__2	Concise, comprehensive primer on rose growing: This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days. It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all.
__label__2	Tom Bethany bares the bears: Enjoyable read from fun author Jerome Doolittle. Tom takes on the S & L corporates in the most unusual of ways. You _think_ you've read the routine via Crais' Elvis or Parker's Spenser, but you ain't seen nothing til you've met Jerome and a few of his friends. Go ahead, get the book. You won't be sorry.
__label__2	Excelent: Is excellent. I recommend it with your eyes closed. The trouble was that my edition came ugly and battered.
__label__2	Lovely sensitive and delicate!: This beauty and cute book is the best for catlover!Stunning photos, easy to read colour charts, a lot of informations also regarding the cats...and wonder projects to stitch!I can't wait to stitch all this beauty pussycats!
__label__2	Cats of the World in Cross Stitch: I have other books by Jayne Netley Mayhew and Nicki Wheeler and I like every one of them. So far this is my favorite and I like how some of the designs can be used for needlepoint as well as cross stitch. It has designs with jungle cats as well as domestic cats and it is very hard to pick a favorite. Both ladies work very well with each other. I'm looking forward to their new book this month and want to collect all the books they will make in the future.
__label__2	Different Covers: I love this book! The cats are beautiful! It works great for needlepoint also. I only gave it a four, because I couldn't do 4.5. My main pet peeve is that the covers get changed on books and if I don't catch it, I end up with duplicates. Luckily I could look inside to compare. My copy is paperback with a ginger cat on the cover... not a tiger, otherwise it would have been a 5.
__label__2	THIS JUST MAKES MY HEART: With definite echoes of Yo La Tengo, Illuminations is the record you SHOULD go to sleep to and it's the best to wake up to. Who else writes a song about director Edward D Wood Jnr (Unfair Kind of Fame). This album is the best to come out of Scotland for ages. It also makes one feel depressed without a special someone in their lives. It's best listened to when thinking of loved ones.
__label__1	"2 Stars For Persistence: Often I feel some admiration for Stephen Pastel and the way he (and Aggie and Katrina) have stayed true to their course and vision with such dogged persistence. So dogged have they been that, having been reviled for years, they're actually more respected than they've ever been.It was with some regret however that I have to report that any admiration I might have evaporates whenever I actually HEAR The Pastels - to be replaced with a feeling of ""can't they find something better to do after all these years"".Now, don't get me wrong, as Pastels go this CD is a lot better than almost anything they've ever done before - still doesn't detract from the fact that this is music by indier-than-thou smug under-achievers made for a captive audience who are, if anything, even smugger. Some people, it seems, are content to stay in their little ghettoes.The lack of talent is excusable, the lack of ambition is not."
__label__2	"Great Christmas classics by a great vocal group.: The Mills Brothers have voices of gold interwoven in a tapestry of magic. Their records made the world sing along, and we still recognize them instantly. Who doesn't know from the first few notes their songs such as ""Paper Doll,"" ""Glow Worm,"" ""Yellow Bird,"" ""You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You"" and many others? On this disc they bring the same level of skill and artistry to Christmas favorites like White Christmas, Silent Night, Joy to the World and more, enriching them with comforting warmth and heartfelt performances. For really nice Christmas music this disc is like a group of old friends sitting by the tree."
__label__2	Mill-ing Around, Merrily: I got this album long ago and have never regretted it. It IS my Christmas album (vinyl) that I use throughout the season. The perfect, blended harmonies of the Mills Brothers, the retro arrangements, the classic Christmas tunes, done with such mellow aplomb always amplify my Christmas mood. It oozes class. I would recommend it to anyone wishing a good, Christmas album, but especially to those audiophiles who appreciate the feel for going back a little in time, to our younger years and reminiscing about Christmases past and the good ol' days.
__label__2	For Me The Gold Standard: Don't know if it's from me listening to my Dad's albums every Christmas or not? For me this is the Christmas album by which all others are judged.
__label__1	Ridiculous!: I sent this unit back to Amazon! Its form factor is contrary to what it says.The camera is small, as they state, but attached to it is a bulky power cable and 9v battery connector. When you hook it all up it's huge! No longer a stealthy camera. Ridiculous!It does not serve its intended purpose.MUVI turned out to be my replacement choice. All reviews are excellent. The image is excellent and it records for hours on an internal battery. There are lots of examples on YouTube.TaosGuy
__label__1	wireless Camera: This was a great camera for the two days that it worked. I don't know what happend to it. I came home from work on the second day and my screen was all fuzzy. It just stopped working.
__label__1	Junk: This wireless camera only works 5 ft away from the receiver. It is supposed to be 100m. What is the point of wireless if you have to be that close?
__label__2	excellent product, but has a short range.: excellent product, but has a very short range of reception and battery life is short lived. You have to adjust the tuner several times before obtaining a good picturem, but not bad for a childs toy as beginner. would recommend to younger kids because it is a fun toy.
__label__1	HORRIBLE CAMERA!: I recently ordered this camera hoping I could fly my helicopter controlling it at close range. Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera.
__label__1	research before buying: i have bought several of these types of camera's form other sellers that work way better. spend the extra couple buck for something reliable. now saying that, with the cost you can't be picky if you are willing to gamble.SECURITY - DON'T BOTHER ( the tuning is way to sensitive, whereas it it really hard to get a constant clear picture.I would not use it for home security of any type as i live in a townhouse, and when set up it literaly make a cracking sound on the monitor when the unit transmits through one wall. )the range is not 200 feet..... maybe 10 feet line of sight. the advertising is false and i think this is why it was a dissapointing buy. i spent $50 bucks on the same type of unit several years ago and it works through the entire house and outside with no problems. this one has trouble transmitting clearly in the same room if large.Sorry to the seller for the bad review, but people need to know the truth about the item.
__label__1	Horrible video: I purchased this wireless camera for use in a medium size model helicopter. Unfortunately the range and quality of the video is quite weak. Even the smallest movement of the camera causes the video to destabilize and lose all detail. Might be good in a fixed location.
__label__1	sucks: It's not what you'd expect. Almost all signals around interfere with the video and audio of this camera. I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption. Not a good product at all. Will be more careful what cameras I buy next.
__label__1	does not work well: 1) both units require power. the camera does have a 9v adpt but not the receiver. 2) there is always a line of interferance on the monitor cause by noise. Not a good picture.3) Picture quality is not clear, grainy and dis-colored4) 1st range test was only about 50' from base which was located in my bedroom and the camera stopped transmitting in my drive way. I will test it outside later5) ther is no on board memory storage, so you'll have to set up a computer or something.good luck..
__label__1	not happy: great concept, however, tuning is imposable, you get some horizontal instability 98% of the time. but when you get it, it looks decent!
__label__2	TYKES: My child is 4yrs old and is REALLY into video games. With pure triumph to win a game. Alot of games are not made for the youngins. He is able mess with this game longer than five or more minutes. I as an adult don't enjoy it but he gets hours of pleasure.
__label__1	Please don't waste your money: I bought this for my 3 year old and it is the dumbest game ever. It has really bad graphics, game play is mega slow, and the music is horrid. They should be ashamed of themselves. Please save your money and buy something else.
__label__2	Best Cover Album Ever!!: This is a great album with many catchy tunes. Listenable from start to finish and a great primer into SCOTS.
__label__2	"Wow, Great CD!: I've been a SCOTS fan a long time. I've seen them many times live, and have purchased most of their music. I get a little frustrated with their ""White Trailer-Trash"" persona because I think it detracts from the fact that their a great rock and roll band. Rick's surf'n swamp guitar work just gets better along with the rest of the band.Thats why I dig this new album so much. I seems like the band really put some time and effort into this disc. Hearing them play The Kinks 'Muswell Hillbilly' and making it their own is a beautiful thing. Rick Miller tearing into 'Tombstone Shadow', awesome. Makes me wish they would do a whole album of Creedence covers! The whole band is really on the same wave-length playing each one of these diverse tunes. Its a shame that 'Walk Like a Camel' was their biggest hit. They deserve a much wider audience. Great Disc."
__label__2	"Gloriously Tacky!: REVENGE OF THE SON OF THE WORLD'S TACKIEST POSTCARDS is indeed tacky. I had no idea that the world was peppered with postcards such as these. In here you'll see hilarious cards from the 50's and 60's and find yourself asking, ""why would someone send a postcard about chopped Balkan horse hearts?"" Just be glad someone did, otherwise your everyday boring life would be deprived of such campy, pointless humor. This is a book you'll pick up periodically for years and laugh ferociously every time. I promise. A BONUS: The postcards are perforated and ready to send! Certainly a must!"
__label__1	A VERY VERY VERY SORRY GAME: this game will never earn akklaim ne sort of money except for ppl who like these kind of lame games it really isnt gwd really the cameara angles really bad too the grphix ok but who care bout grphix when u cant even get a good view of ur character nd the surroundings u will get bored of this game fast dont buy dun ever rent it im serious this game is so confusing too when u collect hearts it doesnt even tell u information on how to get the heart except a wierd riddle they give you that doesnt make any sort of sense plus once u manage to get a heart u get too strart over isnt dat fun u loose all ur extra life u earned and all the heart pieces u earned u need 100 to get a heart wow say u got 99 heart pieces then u pik up a heart guess what u get to start all over collecting the heart pieces dont even rent this game this game is so sorry i bought it and it took me forever to trade with my friend for one of his game i had to give him 5 games for 2 games
__label__1	Camera controls make life miserable: I like platformers, which is why I got this game. I've played it off and on for a week now, only because I hate not finishing something I start. If it weren't for that fact, I'd never touch this game again. The graphics are good, but the camera controls are [bad]. I've died more than once because the game decided to adjust the camera angle while I was in the middle of crossing some tiny bridge or climbing a narrow ledge.
__label__1	oh well: Well yea sure its supposed to be this wonderfull, amazing, groundbreaking platform game. Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank. All in all it probably would be pretty fun and thus you should add one or two stars if your new to this kind of thing, or add a few stars if you really really really like large environments or just platforming in general.
__label__1	Vexx fails: Basically, you can say that this game is about 30% fun and 70% Frustrating. The gameplay is uneccesarily difficult at times and ceases to be 'fun' after about 4 levels in. The camera is terrible. Some have said here dismiss it as 'oh well, all platform games have camera problems'. However, this game definately has the lamest camera of them all.Another dissapointment is the fact that there are no milestones. If you [expire], you get to start over. Period. No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time. Isn't that Fun?Acclaim has definately failed in their foray into platform gaming. Get Ratchet and Clank or Rayman, you will actually enjoy those games. This one looked like it had potential but is just too frustrating. Don't waste your money on this game. It just ain't worth it.
__label__2	VEXX: This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide. It's very basic, dosen't cover the controls, and just skims over the walk throughs. It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline.
__label__2	HE LOVED BIG BROTHER: Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once.
__label__1	Poor quality on Kindle: I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup.
__label__2	1984 is Still A Possibility: I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother.
__label__2	A must read: This is one of the few books I think everyone should read at one point or another of their life. I read this book about 7 years back and I think it does an amazing job of narrating the harrowing experience of people under an oppressive regime.
__label__2	A Frighteningly Real Masterpiece: This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic.
__label__2	My Favorite Book: I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact.
__label__2	"Big Brother is watching you...: Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is ""correcting"" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary. He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."
__label__2	"This is a Very Good Book Indeed.: This is one of the best written books I have had the opportunity to read. Those of you who gave it a 1 are ignorant. And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the ""Homeland Security"" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world. (Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"
__label__2	Parallels: 1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending.
__label__2	A good book that gets old fast: 1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends.
__label__1	"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I: While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
__label__1	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: 1984 by George Orwell, is the most BORING book I ever read for school. To me the plot was not interesting, the characters were useless and the time period .... Although the idea of the government controling everything is scary and most likely true it just didn't have any emotions to make it good. For a book to be good it needs to have emotions, and this book lacked them, and there was also no dialouge which to me is important.KNOT
__label__1	BORRRIIIIING!: I read this book in 8th grade. It was fairly easy to read and was not too hard, but it was by far the most boring and pointless piece of literature that I have ever read in my 15 years of life. I MUCH would have rather read a Case Note!If you are considering purchasing this book, I thouroughly discourage it. If you MUST read something by George Orwell, read Animal Farm. It is a pretty good book...
__label__1	"classic does NOT mean good!!!: If you havent been forced to read this book while in school, or hadnt had a chance to grab it at the library, run while you can. 1984 might have been scary 100 years ago, but not now. If you like reading about old people think they are beating the system by saving a PAPERWEIGHT, then by all means...The book has multiple plot holes as well. Beware the ""government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people"" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"
__label__1	Centennial Edition a Rip Off!! Buy a cheaper version: I had never read 1984 and was very excited to do so only to regret purchasing this edition. In the forward (by thomas pynchon) the entire ending is revealed in great detail. I knew what to expect through the entire book and I really wish that I could get my money back. Dont buy the centennial edition, or at least dont read the forward if you want a nice surprising read.
__label__2	1984 review: The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale.
__label__2	1984... ahead of its time: I just finished- literally- reading the book 1984 by George Orwell and my very first thought as I gazed over the last four sentences upon my nook version of the book was anger. Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended
__label__2	Ugh. Gives me the shivvers.: This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars.
__label__2	Great book. Ready many times over.: I wish I could just rate the book w/out writing a review! I'm not an author. I don't have a way with words!
__label__2	Distrubing Portent of Socialism's Logical Ends: This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end.
__label__2	Important for its portrayal of the mechanisms and motivations of totalitarian power: Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power. A dramatic, illuminating read.
__label__1	"George, Stick to Non-Fiction: This is the second time I've been forced to read this book for aclass, and I have to ask, ""What's the point?"" Maybe if you live in a country that's a monarchy, this book's worth reading, but this is *America*, ok? The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. ""Brave New World"" played up the science fiction aspect of it's ""futuristic"" setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (""Animal Farm""), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (""double-speak?"" Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try ""The Road to Wigan Pier,"" which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened. It's 2000. 1984 was a bad movie with Michael J. Fox."
__label__1	"Only read this if you like getting depressed.: This is a good example of the fact that pessimistic and shocking books often receive rave criticism while dynamically optimistic books are dubbed ""unrealistic""... NO further comment."
__label__1	"A redundant book of philosophy and vericose vains: While embarking on this ""classic,"" don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"
__label__1	"The Political Paranoids' ""Gospel of Orwell"": Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's ""Newspeak"" should include these additions: ""Propaganda is Truth""; ""Truth is Absolute""; ""Freedom springs from Fear""; ""Extremism is Virtue."" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as ""The Crying of Lot 49."" At least IT has the virtue of being well written."
__label__1	not good: Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it.
__label__1	poor: This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics. It is crude, heavy-handed, superficial propaganda.
__label__1	A little too slow: I found 1984 to be an intriguing book. The plot of the book was interesting. How the author went about telling the story was too slow for me. I found it hard to pay attention while reading it. Throughout the entire book there were bits of intereseting parts followed by several paragraphs of, what i found to be, random information. I though it was a great plot but the storyline wasn't to my liking.
__label__2	A old classic that is still pertinent now: This is the second time I have read this book. The first was for school. I enjoyed it more this time because of the things I did appreciate the first time.
__label__2	1984: Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described.
__label__2	A Modern Classic: 1984 is a great read but not a compelling one. It can be a little hard going at times. The characters are a little frustrating thus making it a little annoying to read. Still it is a great classic and well worth persuing to the end.
__label__1	Big Brother Lives: Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online.
__label__1	thing plot, boring read: Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it.
__label__2	Very powerful!: There are few books that I reference as much as this one. Almost every aspect of the homogenization of culture and individualism is realized in this book. You can not discuss world politics without reading this book. Just read the darn book!
__label__2	Better than most: The author has come very close to predicting the future, but we still have a long way to go.A very interesting story built around the future. Although 1984 has come and gone, the future of cameras watching our every move is very possible.As the war in Kosovo proved, some tactics are not just fiction.
__label__2	"Timeless: I recall the flurry of TV and print documentaries that appeared in 1984, all striving to answer the question ""How close are we?"" I thought that generally they missed the point.Yes, Orwell's classic was ostensibly about Totalitarianism, but on a deeper level, it is all about control. 'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled. And, to this day, it still sounds a prescient warning."
__label__2	One of my favortie novels ever!: This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five...
__label__1	It was a very good description of life during anti-social ti: It was a very good description of life during anti-social time
__label__1	"DON'T READ THIS BOOK: i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a ""classic"" but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."
__label__1	this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*-: 1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book.
__label__2	2 MORE ORWELL PROPHECIES CAME TRUE IN 2008: His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?
__label__2	True Prediction: On of the best and prophetic novels ever written about the descent into dehumanizing socialism.
__label__2	great book, but not much action: This book does a great job describing the society and people in it, but if you're reading it for the great action scenes, you might want to look elsewhere. This book is considered a classic for a reason. It actually makes the reader think and contemplate the future of our society compared to the one in the book. So if you're in the mood for a good sc-fi read, I would suggest reading this.
__label__2	very critical but this is the best book ive ever read: people are complaing about the plot but i found this book extremely entertaining and i cannot look at the world or listen to the news the same way. Read the dictionary of newspeak terms at the end and you wont be as depressed when you are done (still not a happy ending but atleast big brother falls)
__label__2	"More Relavent Now than Ever: Anyone who is interested in the nature of power and manipulation of the masses should read this book. Despite the fact that it was orriginaly an inditement against Stalinism, it is still relevant in 21st century America.The nature of the ""War on Terror"" could have been taken dirrectly from the book, in places word for word. The story provides facinating insight into the way that reasonably inteligent people can chose to behave in irrational ways in the name of partiatism and loyalty."
__label__2	"Everyone Must Read This: My brother isn't a person who reads so when he proudly told me he finished 1984, and that I MUST read it, I decided to try it.I was caught up in this book very quickly and I found myself reading it at work. I couldn't put it down. The story is frightening, especially when you think about some of our current issues such as ""Homeland Security"", and the new measures the government is taking to ""protect"" us. Given the current situation in this country I think it is essential to read 1984. This book has made me rethink somethings."
__label__2	"Dark and Bold: 1984 is written in the style of the ""negative utopia."" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."
__label__2	Read it!: Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book. It may show you how human you really are...
__label__2	Really Good Book: 1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more.
__label__2	The Greatest Love Story of Our Time.: 1984 is a social commentary on history and the appalling state of public policy and society generally told through a love story that resonates with a deep familiarity for all modern readers.
__label__2	"A work of genius that provides warning: 1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the ""future"" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."
__label__2	so far so good...: i'm reading this book in my english class right now and i'm actually not even done... i'll admit in the beginning it was pretty slow and kind of boring but we're almost done with it now and i really like it.. i'm not too into reading or anything and it's pretty hard for me to find a book i like... i guess what i'm saying is that it's a good book and people should read it :)
__label__2	scariest forshadow: a personification of the human spirit. after reading of the living death portrayed by the author, i realized that the man sentenced to life enprisonment has liberties unbound. to conceive the perils of this novel, is to enjoy life.
__label__2	More thrilling than any Steven King book!!: People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think
__label__2	Great Classic Everyone Should Read: Orwell's classic about Big Brother that will really keep you thinking. I read in High School and then again recently. Although 1984 is long past, the ideas put forth in this book shadow a darker image of what America could become that will make you think.Great classic! Go read it.
__label__2	"History repeats itself: George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the ""true"" narrative begins."
__label__2	"Not just a ""Political"" Novel: As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
__label__2	Prophetic and Frightening: Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate.
__label__2	Still a very good story: 1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable.
__label__2	"1984 - Frighteningly Realistic: George Orwell's horrific representation of Oceania, a world power and dominating force throughout the story, is a frighteningly realistic presentation of how governments work. Orwell displays the common theme of disinformation (called ""doublethink"")used by government powers. Although 1984 has come and passed, the idea that governments can gain totalitarian control through complacent, uniterested citizens is not far from present conditions. 1984 is an excellent read, filled with wondrous insight for everyone."
__label__2	"Good Read as Both Sci-Fi and Analysis of Society: This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's ""Prince"" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious ""Book"" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."
__label__2	Instant paranoia!: 1984 is a classic and rightfully so! It does not matter that the year has come and passed without such a world but there are subtelties that resemble such a world. In the wake of recent events the atmosphere (in the U.S.) is begining to strikingly resemble some of the aspects of Orwell's nightmarish world.
__label__2	Depressing, but enlightening.: As an American, I enjoy freedoms that are alien to the majority of the world. If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read. Every person who reads this book gets something different out of it, but I can guarentee if you read with interest you will get something out of it.
__label__2	"Ain't the future scary?: THe Party dominate all aspects of life and Big Brother is everywhere with cameras and microphones. Winston Smith is the central character whose diary gives him away along with his affair with Julia. Both are brainwashed into thinking The Party is always right, despite evidence to the contary and Winston ends up staing his love for Big Brother- the ""victory over himself"". O'Brien is Winston's nemesis in breaking him down and is a most interesting characther. ..."
__label__2	Time to think: George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius.
__label__2	Fantastic: Never has a book made me think so much and yet be absolutely terrified for the future. Ending is very bleak and gives one the impression that all hope is lost, but I still highly recommend it.
__label__2	One of 20th Century's Greatest: This book contains supreme beauty and the worst ugliness. One of the greatest works of the 20th century, one all should have a go at.
__label__2	"2008 is 1984: ""It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words"" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."
__label__2	Great book: If you're politically inclined, you'll love this novel about Oceania. Though this book is fiction, you'll find more similarities with your life than you thought possible. The symbolism is great and should be a must-read for any high school student in a high school civics course.
__label__2	The dark world of the future: After reading 1984 it is easy to see why it is a classic. George Orwell's predictions are a dark and terrifying world that captures the reader and forces them on. The stories told is one that may yet come to pass. The things he predicts have in some cases already been implemented in some areas of the world. I found the book to be a somewhat difficult read, so don't expect to breeze through it. All in all I rate it a 5 out of 5.
__label__2	"Go to the real source: This is a great book. Because it has been unsuccessfully re-written many times by lesser minds people suggest this as the source. However, the book ""We"" by Eugene Zamatin, an exiled Russian (like Nabokov, or Dostoyevsky), came first is even more powerful. I believe that it is out of print (at least the english translation), but if there is enough interest in it that could be rectified. Also, now more than ever the theme of governmental control is very relevant."
__label__2	1984 - Fascinating and Terrifying (Doublethink at work!): This book is a work of genius. It is so much more than science fiction. In fact, it's bleak vision of the world is scary because of its plausibility. It is so completely credible and convincing. It is brilliant philosophy, masterful thriller, and love story all at the same time.There is enough explanation about the plot of the book in other reviews, so I'll spare you. This book captured me completely. Read this book if you like thought provoking literature.
__label__2	"Amazing: Orwell was a pioneer in this form of literature. His insight into a ""possible"" future held more accuracy than I'm sure even he imagined.The book is a struggle of man vs. ministry. How far will the few in positions of power go to improve their personal ideals in the guise of overall social improvement?I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dark themes. The ending had me in tears."
__label__2	if it was a prediction...: If this book represents Orwell's circa 1948 prediction of 1984, he wasn't exactly right, but he wasn't completely wrong either. Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health.
__label__2	"a classic: This is a timeless book that seems more true with each passing year. Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no ""memory hole"" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny."
__label__2	NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR: A very well written piece of literature for its time. In light of the current state of affairs, it is rather frightening. It was a good read in High School and an even better fread today.
__label__2	Some classics are over-rated. This is not one of them.: Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother.
__label__2	"Nineteen Ninety Nine: This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"", which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"
__label__2	allthough it shows the extreme, it shows a possilbe truth: This book describes an extreme situation of what totalitarianism can lead to. But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it
__label__2	"Great Book, Couldn't Put It Down!!!: Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading ""the book"" is rather boring and takes a while to read. Overall I would suggest reading it as soon as you can."
__label__2	Wow: My class could do this for an extra credit grad and I am glad about that. This book is frightening realistic. The technology in this is possibly and some of its here, the government has come and gone in a lesser degree, and the issues faced are here. If someone with enough brains and had a hated enemy of the people, this government may come. The story is very believable and is a must read for casual and serious readers alike.
__label__2	"Doubleplusgood!: Wow! I read this after reading ""Animal Farm"" and found it fascinating. It's amazing that a book written so long ago could so vividly portray an author's prediction of how the world would be in 1984. Slightly scary, when you think of how Communism did take control of an empire. George Orwell's ""1984"" is a classic that should always be remembered."
__label__2	"Still poignant after 64 years...Newspeak, Big Brother, and Orwell: This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the ""truth"" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."
__label__1	Kindle Edition is a very sloppy copy/paste: The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file.
__label__2	"Thank our lucky stars government isn't like that...yet.: Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things. Readers ask themselves ""WHY? Why do these people let themselves be subjected to such mind control?"" Really it's all the people know. Somehow to them it makes perfect sense that the past doesn't exist. Scary. One of the best books I've ever read"
__label__2	A masterpiece!: I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece.
__label__2	The best book you should read, but don't in High School: Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come.
__label__2	This book is great, but terrifying.: After I read this book, I was so disturbed that I couldn't concentrate on my homework. Since I could do nothing else, I thought about the book. I realized how lucky we are that we live in a society with privacy, fairness, and freedom. I though it was inhuman when the man in jail (I'm not saying who) was proud of his daughter for turning him in after hearing him mutter in his sleep against the Party. This is the least of the inhuman things that happen. I really am able to apreciate our living in a free society. I hope others can too.
__label__2	An Ordaniary man and his response during a Revolution: This was a wonderful book where the main character, Winston Smith is compelled to speak out aganist Big Brother and the end result is exactly what any one of us would have done. A lot of people I know hated the ending, but I think the ending makes the book. It shows the way that we as humans really do respond in situations like that. Absolutley incredible. This is one of the best books I have ever read.
__label__2	Mrs. man Vanen's Review of Nineteen Eighty-Four: After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution. I read this book on the Supreme 747 PowerJet on my way to Australia. Despite being disturbed several times by male-stewardesses, I was able to tell that this was a fantastic book. It is unfortunate that this book caused the writer years of sickness and was bedridden for the remainder of his life. And that I was not included in his will. read this book!Judas man Vanen
__label__2	Sheer Brilliance!!!!!!!: Orwell's 1984 is certainly one of the greatest novels ever written. It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement.
__label__2	I liked this book.: This was a good book. I just finished reading it for a tenth grade English class and it was good. It was kinda boring at first, but I liked it. I would recommend it to my friends.
__label__2	This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind: This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
__label__2	I love this book!: Twisted view of a future world, even more creepy looking at it from a time 20 years after this imaginary future... it is interesting to compare and contrast this book with reality...
__label__2	"My ""1984"" Review: I think that the book ""1984"", written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions. It was a book about a man fighting for his rights only to fine out he had to give in a bit. ""1984"" was a book that captured me into its story and I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"
__label__1	"Slow, Boring, and Depressing: I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading ""The Partner"", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."
__label__1	review for 1984: I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.
__label__1	An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense: I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it.
__label__1	The Most Boring Book I Ever Read: I think 1984 is not very interesting. The words are difficult. I had no clue what was really going on. It would be less boring if it was shorter and broken down so it would be easier to understand. You might like this book if you are interested in predicting the future and you can read lots of difficult words and know what they mean. Keep your dictionary close!
__label__2	great purchase: great book, great presentation, first time i bought something for kindle. really please so far. looking forward to new titles and new features for kindle.
__label__2	Read this book!: I really can't give this novel any less than five stars. I read it every year and find something new, something often horrifyingly accurate in whatever political climate you're in. READ IT!
__label__2	A classic: Chilling especially given how powerful the media has become in our current society. Orwell was brilliant, and in this book, he is able to identify the critical elements of a democratic society that we often just take for granted.
__label__1	This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn: This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn..the condition is definitely NOT GOOD..Got this book for $4...It's not worth more than 25 cents for sure.
__label__1	"A Good Book but Not the Best!!: This book is essentially the same as ""The Brave New World"" but expressed in a totally different way. Somehow, I like the ""The Brave New World"" better. It gave me a totally different view."
__label__1	Review of this digital download, not of the material, merely the presentation and the first version downloaded but removed.: Ok, just where to begin. First this digital download version is a joke. Someone did not format correctly. Each line is either double or triple spaced, even if you change font. Why stop there? Why not put a word per page?I would like to return the digital download, but can not find a phone number to speak with someone. Or a mechanism to return it.1984 is a good read. Content is good, presentation, not so much.
__label__2	Genious, Peo-ple!: have you read? Its the book everyone is reading now. It shows what its like to live in a totalagrarian society like Nazi Germany or W. U.S.
__label__2	"I read this book 10 years ago...: I read this book back in high school, thinking ""Well, it's a classic. One of those books I SHOULD read."" I was right. There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read. There's constant references to this in media, pop culture, etc. It's just an important piece of literature. I think every single person who cares about their own intelligence should read this book. You just HAVE TO! Nuff said."
__label__1	"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
__label__1	"monotony: Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
__label__1	"CONFUSING!!!: I READ THE BOOK ""1984"" BY GEORGE ORWELL. tHE BOOK WAS ABOUT A GUY NAMED WINSTON WHO FOUND A DIARY AND WROTE HIS FEELING IN IT WHICH WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS RATHER BORING AND CONFUSING TO READ. I DIDNT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE THINGS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN READING THE BOOK I SUGGEST THAT YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY AND WONT BE CONFUSED."
__label__1	George Go Home: George had a good idea, I'll give him that, otherwise the book fell short. Very short. For me the book took a downword turn during the time where Winston started having a love affair with some girl. This girl latter became a thought police inforcer, which surprised me none. I found the book to be a bore of a read and very predictable. My advise to all of you fair readers is to steer clear of this vile book. You will live longer because of it.
__label__1	I think this book is horrible: I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
__label__1	Big Brother is Watching!: George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great.
__label__1	"Garbage and other phrases...: Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."
__label__2	Timeless and Enduring Social Commentary: Orwell's tale of a society where not only behaviour, but also thought is controlled, seems to grow ever more relevant as the years pass and new technologies of surveillance emerge. 1984's concept of `Big Brother' has passed into everyday use, and the `telescreens' used not just to broadcast, but to watch people, increasingly appear throughout the real-world society in the form of surveillance cameras. Whilst the totalitarian governments of `Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War. A timeless and enduring tale that will remain relevant and controversial well into the future, despite being set in the past.
__label__2	1984: This is yet another book that is difficult to put down. There are a few sections that you have to trudge through but it is entirely worth it. This is a very thought provoking novel and is beautifully written.
__label__2	Must Read: 1984 has come and left, some may say that this book has lost its importance after the collapse of communism. I think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate. The important point about 1984 is that if you don't pay attention 1984 can always become a reality. Need to listen to some of the people running for the top spot in this country and you can see them building their own ministry of truth.R HemingwayPast Twilight
__label__2	Hackneyed but prophetic: The power of Orwell's writing comes from the ideas expressed therein, not from the characterization or the quality of the writing. Orwell's characters in this novel are crafted of the finest cardboard, the writing is crafted of the finest of didactic lead, but the ideas therein are important -- because they are prophetic of what 2004 could be, and what 2003 may be becoming, if the current leadership of our country has its way.
__label__2	"Required Reading for every intelectual and all others!: Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..""a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.""This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."
__label__2	"Thought-provoking: If you have not read this, I strongly recommend it ... ESPECIALLY if you are like me, and somehow ""escaped"" having this assigned to you either in high school or in college, but have always wondered what the hype was all about.Too many times today, you will hear this book discarded as a bunch of prophesies that were way off -- e.g., that in the year 1984 there would be computers and ""telescreens"" that would all but read our minds; that ""Big Brother"" would always be watching us. Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of ""Big Brother"" -- i.e., how information is ""cleansed"" to ""protect"" us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"
__label__2	21st century reading: It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world.
__label__2	Big Brother is watching you!!!: 1984 is about a man named Winston Smith and the totalitarian society he lives in. Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today.
__label__2	Where the dystopia begins: I'm a first time reader of 1984 and am in love. I can't believe that it didn't show up in my reading list before now! I have been a long time fan of dystopia and am so excited to have read finally a founding book of the genre.I was absolutely enthralled. It has been a while since a book has grabbed me like this. To say I'd recommend this book is a gross understatement. If you've been holding off on reading this stop holding off!!
__label__2	Great book, skip intro, expensive ebook: Loved the book. But if you read it, skip the intro! It is extremely spoiling for the plot, it annoys me that it wasn't put at the end. After reading a couple of spoilers I skipped it. Similarly, it annoys me that the ebook is the most expensive option.Other than that I find this an epic book, a must read.
__label__2	Be Aware! This is where our government is headed: It is a world very much like ours today - no privacy, ignorance of the world and wars around us, everyone conforming to be no different than ones neighbor, and government only telling the public what they want them to know.Open your eyes and read this warning to what very well could become true if we do not change.
__label__2	Big Brother in the back door!: Well here we are in 2000, the year 1984 just a memory. Our fears of Orwell's book being a prophecy fully abated.Like most people I first read this book in school. Like most people I came away with the idea that the collectors of information will end up like Big Brother. I too cried '1984' when the government tried to collect even more info on us.Shortly after Princess Diana's death, though, I read this book for a second time. I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information. Who controls information today? The media. Compare Princess Diana's life to Winston's.Very good book. Well worth reading again as an informed adult. At least that is this proles opinion.
__label__2	"Required reading in these fictitious times: No novel seems to be more relevant these days than George Orwell's 1984. While the year has passed the ideas of trickery and deception by the government still exist. Oceania could easily be the United States and Big Brother could be any one of the three letter orginizations in the US. No there arent telescreens everywhere, but thanks to the deceptivly titled ""Patriot Act"" Orwells nightmare is eerily closer to reality than ever before. Read this book. Period."
__label__2	1984: 1984 by George Orwell is a story of a totalitarian government and a man living under its power. Winston, the main character, struggles to fight the ruling outer party, even though his works for them changing historical documents to fit the parties needs. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys conspiracy stories. The only negative thing I can say about this book is it becomes slow in some parts, but over all it is a great read.
__label__2	A frightening tale of an enslaved, socialist future: 1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life. There's little more I can say. Just read the book for yourself; it's what I call required reading.
__label__2	"Oh, god, please...: Dear ""reader from Mt. Pleasant, MI"":What on earth are you talking about? You think Orwell actually wrote 1984 because he was mad at the world? Christ, you make it sound like 1984 is the work of a nihilist. 1984 is a dark satire of totalitarian governments. No, the Soviet Union was not as bad as Oceania, but a satire is supposed to exaggerate.The novel has a perfectly legitimate political purpose, and has nothing to do with Orwell being mad at the rest of the world. You clearly didn't understand much about the book at all.As for why I liked it, most of it has been said already. It offers great insight into human nature and politics. Plus it's very well written. It is also probably the most immediately interesting and intriguing books I've read."
__label__2	"Chilling tale of anti-utopian England: I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve ""the Party"" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."
__label__2	Fine book to read: Even if some people disagree with me, I will say this is one of the best books you can read. Everyone must read this book, it has the power to change your beliefs about the world.1984 goes deep to show you what the world COULD be like if a ruling party did all the right things to gain complete control over the populace. Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading.
__label__2	Not just cheap propaganda!: I've read the book and found not only fun in it, but also deepness and complex political explanations. It is not only propaganda against communism, cause as everybody knows Orwell, in fact, liked communism ideals. It shows how individualism is smashed in a totalitarian society. I also recomend the animation movie AntZ. As many have seen it is not meant for kids...
__label__2	"Perfect.: Just three words; scary, depressing and wonderful. Definetely the best fiction about the future that i've read . Even better than Huxley's 'Brave new world'. I now start to feel afraid about the future. I now start to wonder if there are big brothers, ""ministry of peace""s , shortly ""OCEANIA""s waiting for us in the future?War can never be peace. Whatever type of future it is.1984 is the best novel I've ever read."
__label__2	doubleplusgood: it moved me to tears and no book has ever done that, it was very deep. very scary because its pluasable
__label__2	Delicious, quenched all my political hunger!!!: Well I read this book in the following reasons. TO learn about more in socialism and communisms differences and to learn a different point of view. I guess this book applies to every different reader something different because it holds many values and the values can be undestood from many ways. In simple quotes many things were hidden to find out them was like a puzzle for every reader I guess. I thing this was a book that I really liked to read and also I would like to share my ideas with other readers of this book and other readers of books related to this topic.
__label__2	A book that deserves thought: When I try to think of my reaction to this book, it goes beyond enthusiam. In fact, at first, I was speachless after reading the last sentence; the build-up was so intense that I actually thought that I was reading a historical account of the human experience. For those of you who haven't read the afterword by Erich Fromm, I highly recommend you do. He provides a much needed explanation for Orwell. This book offers a very important vision, one that needs due evaluation. If you read this account of the future, you must read Huxley's Brave New World, as he offers an alternative.
__label__2	excellent, well written and ver realistic: i thought it described well the possibilties of the power of the govbernment if we the people do notstnad up against the oppression the are providing.
__label__2	Fascinating, but...: I'm glad I read this book. It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue. Good or bad, that's the way it is.Otherwise, this lived up to hype and icon status that it is known for.
__label__2	You wanna be suicidal?: Orwell tells a story about Winston Smith, a man living in the utopian world of 1984! The book deals with his struggles, and eventually, the story's end is so depressing that in the end, you may want to commit suicide or take up liquor. BEWARE
__label__1	"Depressing: Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950""s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. ""Cold Sassy Tree"" comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."
__label__2	"A Grim Orwell: This is such a grim, frightening and scary book by George Orwell. Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for ""thought crimes."" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, ""I love you"" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim. However, still a good book.*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
__label__2	Right in the feels: George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments.
__label__2	The classic privacy horror story: Nineteen Eighty-Four remains the popular watchword for invasion of privacy fifty years after its publication. The novel can be read as a warning against the malign personalization that could be possible with a systematic technological attack on privacy. `The worst thing in the world,' says the hero's torturer, `varies from individual to individual.' The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. ``The command of the old despotisms was ``thou shalt not''. The command of the totalitarianisms was ``Thou shalt''. Our command is: ``*Thou art*.''
__label__2	A mind altering book.: This has to one of the best books i have ever read. It shows us what the world would be like if governments obtained complete power over the populace. It makes one think, and if you are not ready for how it makes you think then you may find it long and boring. Give it a chance though, you'll be rewarded.
__label__2	Big Brother is Watching Yo' Ass: WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. I am unable to adequately describe to you here how utterly amazing (also horrifying, nightmarish, grim, cold, and bleak) this book is. If you feel that you're capable of transcending to a new level of intellectual awareness and intelligence, then you're ready for this book. People who read this book that aren't ready for this transition will find the experience unfulfilling.
__label__2	A very critical view of a very possible future: Everyone knows the story of Big Brother sybolizing the communist movement in the USSR in the 1940's, but this book is far more than that. Towards the end of the book, where other people has refeered to as boring, there is a very deep section on the human mind and our understanding of the things happening around us. This is clearly one of the greatest pieces of lititure ever written.
__label__2	"Timeless Future Fiction: As gripping and wrenching now as it was on my first reading in 1972. For old film buffs there is a black and white production with Richard Burton and Fred Hurt. Also excellent. A modern dystopian tale available on Amazon, ""Transfer"", by Jerry Furland, portrays a new tyranny not unlike Orwell's in it's ubiquity. ""Transfer"" is stunninglyfrsh and topical. Like Orwell, Furland's impact is a mirror of the reader, hated or loved, but never hohum. Check it out. But hit Animal Farm before you leave Orwell:)"
__label__2	Thought-provoking and at times chilling: Many have heard allusions to Big Brother through television or movies. Many have heard that they should read this book because it's a classic, or because of the amazing predictions from 1949 about life in the future. Everyone should read this book.If you read it hoping to find action, or hoping to find a tie to the world as we know it, you most likely won't comprehend the actual meaning of the words. You'll be most successful if you consider what we have today compared to what we had when Orwell wrote the book in 1949. Think of how much the world has changed, and how far there is left to go.Read this book, and every chapter think of the relationship to everyday life. This isn't a book that should be skimmed. Think of the implications of Orwell's predictions. Realize that it could happen.Is it a novel, or is it possible? Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?
__label__2	Frighteningly close to the truth: For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984.
__label__2	Is this Bush and Ahmadinejad's playbook?: I never read Orwell in school for some reason and I am glad I waited. I can't believe this was written in the late 40's. O'Brien's descriptions of seeking power for power's sake and the mutability of truth and history have never been more applicable to current events. Reading this book now, you really start to feel like this must be on Karl Rove's desk.
__label__2	"This book will make you think: Perhaps the description will seem turgid and tiresome as you read 1984, but in retrospect it will have been to your great advantage to have read of this negative utopia. Regarding the one reviewer who gave this book one star -- please, actually pay attention before you write another review, and get your facts straight. Julia wasn't in the Thought Police. Why don't you go back to English class, and after you've mastered ""Green Eggs & Ham"" try Orwell again. Thank you."
__label__2	Both excellent and important: Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written.
__label__2	"Orwells dark but good book: George Orwell's, ""1984"", is a classic and detailed adventure that will leave you asking for more. The story is set in London where Winston, the main character, works for big brother. But he soon finds himself questioning Big Brother and how he works.For a while Winston tried to blend in with the crowd and not really stand out. But when Winston starts to remember his childhood, he begins to question Big Brother. Winston soon finds himself wondering what life was like before big brother. But unless he takes a real chance, he has no way of changing anything.One flaw I found with the book was its detail. I like a lot of detail, but this book overdid it. I would soon found myself thinking about other things and not the book."
__label__1	"1984: 1984,by Georgee Orwell,is not fun to eat although cheese is. The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, ""Boring!"" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."
__label__1	Fun, but historically innacurate: Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book.
__label__1	BORING: This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it
__label__1	boring: This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression. In any case, everybody's moved over to the American model, so Orwell's scrawlings would do well to stick around on their crusty little island.
__label__1	BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS TEENS WELL ANYBODY: Okay all this book was about was random sex, the destruction of human nature, and the ending of all morales. However I must admit that Orwell had a prphetic sense when it camr to the idea of being watched constantly by the government. This book lacked a decent plot as well. THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED.
__label__1	Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring: As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on.
__label__1	I've never thought about the affects of a book quite so much: Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it.
__label__1	I just couldn't get into it.: This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it.
__label__1	"School Book review: I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
__label__2	Big Brother: I don't think I can say anymore about this than hundreds of other readers have already mentioned. It's a classic and rightfully so. But will Big Brother eventually take over our lives? You be the judge.
__label__2	Crazy to think about: There is a lot of information and insinuations in this book - so many that I will definitely have to read it over and look deeper into Orwell's meanings. Most of it I did pick up on though and I must say that I love the story as much as I love Orwell's intentions with this book. Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel.
__label__2	Great!(:: The book was a little slow being delivered but no problems! It also came in better condition than I was expecting! (:
__label__2	Most important book of the 20th century: Firstly this is a fantastic book and a fantastic read. At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons. Namely Churchill and Orwell through the main character of this book. It is an excellent exploration of the two men and really gives an idea about who they were and what they really stood for.
__label__1	"Great Book, Inumerable Glaring Errors: I love this book, it was a great read.However, there are simply too many mistakes, misspellings, etc in this version. This is the very worst edition of any book I have ever read. I started highlighting the mistakes on my kindle, but there were just too many and I gave up.Add to that that the chapters are not marked, and there is no proper index.If you do buy this horrible edition, be prepared to read around an obvious error every other page or so.Some examples include:""There were four others oil the committee""""And they would sit round die table""Bottom Line: I want my money back."
__label__2	Not for the simple minded and/or immature: A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book. It is useless to prescribe it to silly bobby-socksers whose minds and interests can't go beyond TV shows about spoiled teenagers and/or Most-Popular-Boy-on-Whatyamacallit-School-Team. Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ.
__label__2	Looking at a future that is now past: I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience.
__label__2	Wonderful Work.: Richard Brown's voice is perfect for 1984 - a novel about a distopia. I listened to this while driving to work in my car. This is a very deep, thoughtful novel to begin with. It is made so real by a good actor. I highly recommend this.
__label__2	One of the greatest books ever: I literally continuously read this book for about nine months. I would finish the book in only a few days, but I absolutely loved it. I just started over and kept reading it and re-reading it. This is one of those books where the plot got better every time and even knowing the ending did not dampen the suspense. I thought this book is one of the greatest of its class ever. Orwell is a true master.
__label__2	"1984 is based on ""We"" by Jevgenij Samjatin: 1984 On september the 6.th someone said that Orwell never read, and therefore was not inspired by ""We"". That is not true. I have got a rewiew of ""we"" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times."
__label__2	"Frighting............: A frighting look at how the future could turn out. A world where Independent thought is a crime, because it is not sactioned by the goverment. A world where Big Brother is always right, because there is no way to prove it is wrong. A world where your kids may turn you in for being an Enemy of the State, simply because you said the words ""Down with Big Brother"". A protrait of a world that could very easily become our own unless we do everything in our power to fight it. Those who believe that Big Brother could never happen, will most likely be the first ones into Room 101. Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both once said ""Those who give up Freedom for Security, will not have, niether do they deserve, either."" 1984 is a perfect description of a society that gave up their freedom hoping for safety. Instead, they lost both, trading in the criminal in the streets, for criminals in the Halls of Government, and in essence, the innocent have become the criminals."
__label__2	Imagine the image of a boot stamping a human face, forever..: Nineteen Eighty Four offers a harrowing glimpse into the totalitarian state. Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader).
__label__2	"A book of prophecy about America: Someone gave me a used copy of this book when I was very young, and it sat on my bookshelf for many years before I read it. Although I found its ""science fiction"" setting to be engaging, it wasn't until my later years as an adult in the U.S. that I began to appreciate Orwell's foresight into the political future of our country.I am sure it would be controversial to conclude that we are now living under the watchful eye of Big Brother, but having read this book, I consistently do a ""double-take"" when I observe the evolving cultural and legal climate in our country. Our mainstream media may not admit that the ""thought police"" exist, but thanks to Orwell, I find myself always looking over my shoulder!"
__label__2	a classic: i have read this book over and over. it never bores meno matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live inpoliticians never change and always practice the art of deception.people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely
__label__2	Literally Genius, Politically Mind-Provoking: The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time. It makes us think of the world in the book, and inevitably compare it with ours. 1984 stands as one of my all-time favourite. And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16.
__label__2	Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book: Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )
__label__1	"Great story, poor Kindle rendition: Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the ""Kindle edition"" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."
__label__2	"The truth is scary, isn't it?: I feel as though I should be shouting all the cheesy cliches: ""What a page-turner!"", ""I couldn't put it down!""; but I would hate to parallel such mindlessness with Orwell's pure genius. 1984 is an excellent story with familliar characters (the rebel, the romantic, etc.), but also much more. Orwell's accuracy surrouding both the government and the media is undeniably disturbing. This book and ""Brave New World"" have turned me on to a whole new genre of literature."
__label__2	"a shattering ending to a rather slow book: Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like ""Animal Farm"" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."
__label__2	"A great book, makes you believe in how good a story can be: ""Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree."" 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."
__label__2	"Good if you stick with it: At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like ""doublethink"" and ""newspeak"". And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."
__label__2	on my shortest list of favorites: Just to add my voice to the rest here. It's hard to overstate the combination of message, artistry, and foresight in this book.
__label__2	Devestating: While the subject of this story intrigued me it also really disturbed me at the same time. I think it was an important read. Big Brother, here we are. I won't say you'll have fun from reading this book but I will say you will learn a thing or two about our world and where we are going.
__label__2	BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!: When I read this story, I was amazed. Though it's written 50 years ago, you can find some things that really exist in our time. Maybe not as terrible but terrible enough. This story is a vision on the future. A future that may come sooner that we expect. I recommend this book to every book lover, this one you can't miss, and remember: Big brother is watching you!
__label__2	george orwell, 1984: this is an amazing book. although it's non-fiction, it almost scares you into beleiving that you're living in their society. very thought-provoking, and very powerful. hard to believe that it was written so long ago.
__label__2	"A true classic!: Orwell does a fantastic job of showing the negative effects of a utopia. He shows how ""the party"" can take over everything. They can control you, and everyone can be the same. The individual person no longer exists. His realisism portrays true possibilities of what might occur. 2 thumbs up ! Go Lakers!"
__label__2	A book that gives me a new outlook on life: This book has changed my vision of natural human nature. I have found many events and characteristics of the Party to be preshadowings of organizations I see everyday. It also showed me how an evil administration can distroy a love that was so strong. This book is scary and too real.
__label__2	If you read it years ago, try listening this time...: This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did.
__label__2	The ideas are more important than the literature: This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in.
__label__2	Hauntingly relevant: This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are.
__label__2	outstanding: I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli. This is a fantastic story that is VERY easy to read, get involved in, relate to the main character, and find oneself caught in the truth of versus the appearance of reality. Excellent!!! A+
__label__1	Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...: I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them.
__label__1	doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews: this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book. I was excited to read it before amazon.com stole it.
__label__1	to future ap worlld history students: I honestly dont like this book its just not the type of stuff i like to read. So any of you that are thinking about reading this if your favorite book is the twilight series, eragon or the vampire diaries you probably wont like it either. I only read it because i had to.
__label__2	"Rough paper edges: A comment on the ""packaging"": Though the paper quality is nice, the book has rough cut edges, which for me makes the pages harder to turn. When flipping through, it's difficult to turn just one page at a time. Also, the print is a little hard to read; the font is Times style, and the thin parts of the font are much thinner than the thick parts, unusually so, making the letters harder to recognize."
__label__1	"1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.: While regarded as a ""classic"" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."
__label__1	It rings false.: The book has not much to say. It is just the common night-mares of its time. The contents can be discussed as a historical document.
__label__1	"Rediculously boring and redundent: ""1984"" by George Orwell was extremely boring. The text was so long and unelaborate. I think that the text could have needed some more details and more drama. I have heard many good things about this book, but aparently I was dissapointed after reading this. I had expected the same great literary work as ""Animal Farm"" which I had loved and read many times in highschool. I was greatly dissapointed with the redundent and unecessary words. I would definitely not recommend this book to someone who likes drama and more elaborate text."
__label__1	Orwellspeak, Sum Total Zero: George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is all catchphrases, Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak and it is absolutely rendered down to a zero summation, a monumental ode to nothingness, an ideologically streamlined state of unbelievable being.Chris Roberts(speak)
__label__1	disappointed: i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve
__label__1	"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Winston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
__label__2	A Must Read for Literary Fiction Fans: Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again.
__label__2	Gives me chills: I don't think this story really needs my review. So many people have already said everything that needs to be said. All I can say is when I was done with reading this story I felt a trembling deep inside of myself that never fully went away. There is a terrible truth here that needs to be seen.
__label__1	"Orwell....just a little too far out there for me.: I thought George Orwell's 1984 was an ""ok"" book. I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people. So just because I didn't think the book was that fantastic, don't let that stop you. I would advise you to read this book to see if Orwell's depiction of this strange negative utopia is for you."
__label__1	"1984: I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now ""drones"" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind. Still curious as to the outcome as I forgot the ending. More when completed.Would I recommend this book? depends, but not for everyone...I liked reading ""The Help"" better with the character interactions..."
__label__1	Book was not trimmed: The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
__label__1	bad service: really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers.
__label__2	Ageless classic: I had seen the movie based on this book years ago. The book has as much meaning in this day and age as it did when it was written.I was captivated by how stark, dirty, dingy, and hopeless the main charcter's view of the world is, even when trying to rebell.I think it's a very insightful look into just where a society can go. Even one with the best of intentions. It's very applicable in this era.
__label__2	"Orwell's Greatest Work!: I have read everything Orwell has ever penned, even his essays, and this is by far his best piece of work. The efficiency of his prose, the imaginative use of language that has become part of our daily lexicon (how many times have you used the term ""Big Brother""?). This is truly a treasure and a novel that I read at least once a year."
__label__2	"Thinking Book (Review written by Muad'Dib): This is a really wierd book. In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show ""Big Brother""), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell's books you'll LOVE Animal Farm."
__label__2	1984 defines our distrust for government: The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives.
__label__2	1984- More than just philospohy: When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!
__label__2	Captivating: Although I used to read books all the time (mostly teen series like the Baby-Sitters Club), I rarely find one these days that I can stand to read for more than 10 minutes. A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me. It doesn't matter how accurate he was about communism or whether or not communism is really bad. The fact remains that it is a wonderfully written and incredibly creative piece of work.
__label__2	"wow!!!!!!!!!!!: this has got to be the greatest book i have ever read.it kept me in suspence to the very last.it can be taken on so many levels. the best thing about it is the ending, where unlike day of the triffids or any other contemperies,there is not one glimpse of hope which is better than ""they live happily ever after"" BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!!!!!"
__label__2	"Big Brother is watching you turns real: I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says "" tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. "" or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?"
__label__2	1984: The most brilliant political treatise ever written: Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment.
__label__2	"It was a good book with an unfortunate ending.: The entire book was good up until the last chapter, at least in my opinion. Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try. However, the book was well put together overall with very strong characters and a strong plot. It's scary if ""Oceania"" ever became the world of today."
__label__1	Not such a hot book: As is the custom of Barth, this book is informative but incredibly boring. The story of the Basseri is detailed and interesting but Barth has a style all his own and to say the least it is not engaging.
__label__2	A hilarious roller-coaster ride thru a mixed up life!: I loved its candid, campy humor, madcap adventures, and sixties rebelliousness. Very stimulating reading! Fun!! Holly's adventures are priceless. It was great fun living the journey... Brian
__label__2	"Project Samuel: I completely enjoyed this book. ""Dr Jack"" captured the current possibilities of cloning in his new book. It was hard to put it down, especially since I work in the biotechnology field. I especially love the ending (which I will not give away). You will just have to read it yourself."
__label__2	Spellbinding fantasy: The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through. The author's love of baseball and it's heros is evident. I couldn't put it down, had to rush to the very satisfying finish. Looking forward to more from Polidoro.
__label__2	Timely SciFi: With all the news of cloning humans lately, this book is timely, if not prescient. Jack Polidoro's scientific background and his expertise in reproductive biology show in this novel. His love of baseball is also evident. Jack has a writing style that keeps you turning the pages and will make the plot come alive.

__label__2	love it!: I always have a hard time finding a concealer that is just right. But this concealer I found years ago, and I've been using it ever since! I have dark bags under my eyes and this concealer helps lighten them up. Definitely recommend it!
__label__1	Don't be fooled: I had high hopes for this product and I was completely disappointed. If you like wearing makeup that looks very obvious, then this is your product. It was very cakey and did not cover anything unless is was piled on in multiple layers- which looks really attractive. Plus it always came squirting out of the tube without being squeezed. I ended up throwing it away in the garbage where it belonged.
__label__2	Amazing!!!!: Just purchased this product and was totally amazed!!! I have tried so many differect concealer products and was disappointed each time with their efficacy. The first time I used ColorBlend, I knew I'd finally found what I have been searching for. It conceals so well, and looks so natural. Thank you ColorBlend.
__label__1	I'm probably doing something wrong. =(: I have yet to find a concealer that I am happy with. I have really dark under eye circles and this does camouflage them somewhat, but not how I had hoped. Instead of covering them, it seems to change their shade. Kind of like as if I were painting and rubbed white paint on a black spot, turning it grey. Get what I mean? It also looks really CAKEY! It could be because I have really dry skin, but not even with moisturizer + primer does it stop looking cakey.I'm returning this for my money back. That's primarily why I bought it here. I'm going to try Eve Pearl's salmon concealer in my shade, as well as Shiseido's concealer. Hopefully I'll find one I like.
__label__2	Hope seasons 5 and 6 come out soon: I love this show! I ordered seasons 5 and 6 in July of 2011. Maybe the DVDs will be out in 2013.
__label__2	Can someone tell me what season the Zorro episode is on?: Could one of the Bob Newhart Show fans tell me what season the episode of Bob Hartley dresses as Zorro for a masquerade party,and ends up on the ledge of of a building is included on?Thank You.
__label__1	What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6: The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
__label__1	Wait for a Better Release: As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided. There are still some channels broadcasting the series and even though they are the cut-up syndicated version, it was better than what I bought. Wait for someone responsible like Shout Factory to do it right.Try Hulu, it may be there.
__label__1	Great for native japanese speakers: First I have to say I am disappointed that I ended up buying a Drama Audio CD instead of a OST. While I love the Karin Anime, spending the money on something I do not fully understand is a bit aggravating.All that aside, I'm sure the CD will be a treat to listen to. It unfortunately means my imagination will be in overdrive most of the time trying to create some semblance of what is happening.If you are a devoted Karin fan who likes collecting Japanese Audio Drama CDs, this is for you.If you're looking for the actual Background Music to the Karin series, you'll have to look elsewhere. You could start with www.play-asia.com. However, with Amazon.com always updating and changing, you may be able to find what you're looking for.Enjoy! ^_^
__label__1	Chibi Vampire Review: This CD is not the music but a Drama CD. It basically has skits from the anime on it.Karin
__label__2	Great combination for camping...: I recently took this on my last camping trip. Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary. What was useful was the light that gave me a bright led that helped keep my tent lit when getting ready for bed. When I did try out the fan I was impressed by the air that came thru. Although my experience is more with the light I would say this is a necessary purchase for anyone taking a camping trip.

__label__1	Don't waste your money!!: Wenzel is a good name, so I bought this fan based on their reputation! This fan is hurting their reputation, what a waste of plastic!! I agree with the other reviewer, you'll do better by fanning yourself.
__label__1	"Weak compared to the competition: Pros: Uses 6 AA batteries which gives it a long life (about 9 hours with NiMH rechargables) in a fairly compact size. I did not see the problems that others have reported with the light not turning off or shoddy construction.Cons: The breeze it produces is fairly weak and diffuse. It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5"" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters. I thought the built-in light on the Wenzel would be nice but it seems that I usually don't want the fan and light pointing in the same direction. It would make more sense to have a separate light."
__label__1	CRAPPY FAN, DECENT LIGHT....: I ordered this fan for a recent camping trip, and never got to use the fan. I had it set up at the foot of my inflatable mattress, and one of my kids tipped it over accidentally. The fan detached from it's base, and I wasn't going to perform surgery on it during my vacation. The light on it is pretty bright, and we did use it throughout the trip. I'm sure there are much better, more durable fans out there.
__label__2	great fan: I frequently attend scrapbook retreats and crops and am very hot natured - so I ordered this fan for those occassions and it is great and the light on the top of it is an added bonus
__label__1	A Real Disappointment: This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment.
__label__1	Save your money!: I ordered two of these fan/lights. I wanted them for the fan.With the first one, the light wouldn't turn off. I had to remove the batteries when not using the fan. With the second one, the batteries only lasted two-and-a-half hours. Six batteries should have lasted longer.
__label__1	It hardly puts out any air: I can't recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn't actually get any thing done. Well if i had to say some thing nice about it that would be it has a nice LED light in there. So in conclusion don't waste your money on this product get a better reviewed one instead.
__label__2	Ideal answer to a power outage: This is the 2nd Wenzel LED Fan Light we have purchased from Amazon.My wife has severe asthma and during a spring power outage from a storm, the lack of air circulation bothered her until we remembered the first of these fans we had purchased earlier.We checked with Amazon for a second one and it arrived just in time to help us in a second power outage from a summer storm. Therefore I highly recommend these not only for camping, but for the type of emergency use we have experienced.
__label__2	Great Fan/Light: My husband took his LED Fan Light on RAGBRAI (Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) and was really impressed with and so were all of his friends. It withstood his tent blowing down and being ruined in a storm in the middle of the night.
__label__1	DON'T BUY: This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!
__label__2	Good Gun case: Pretty good gun case. I use it to hold 2 handguns and a kel-tec sub 2000(small rifle that folds in half). I can put all the guns on the top level then all the magazines and other items on the bottom level. Case closes tight and nothing moves around. The only bad is that the locks are useless, the key dose not fit well and it is hard to lock/unlock. I have just stopped using the lock, which would be a problem around children.
__label__1	pathetic: Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her.
__label__1	"Pointless Movie!!: I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
__label__1	Movie sucks: This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
__label__1	Save your money.: I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible.
__label__1	one of the worst Cannes winners: That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry.
__label__1	The Worst Movie Of All Time: This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie.
__label__1	Are you kidding me?: I watched this film a few years ago, and like The Secretary, it was a truly bad film. Sick and extremely disturbing, not to mention boring. I must've fell asleep 10 times while watching this film. I could've made a better movie. Not recommended.
__label__1	A real downer: If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. If you like true tragedies, then I think it would be a good film. The acting is quite good. At one point the main character tries to make love to her own mother. The whole movie was just too disturbing for me.
__label__2	From A Music Teacher!: This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians.
__label__1	Not What I Expected Or Even Close: The acting was good for what it was. The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was. The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.
__label__2	Classical music and sado-masochism...: ...who would have thought they could co-exist? This movie is criticized as being devoid of content, except for it's graphic sexual and violent content. I would disagree with this viewpoint. I think of it more as a study of mental illness. The film is highly unpredictable and very well made. I loved the music in the film as well. I personally didn't get the impression the filmmaker was attempting to make any broad-sweeping philosophical statements or moral pronouncements, as its critiques on this website are suggesting. Its simply a bizarre, somewhat disturbing movie that is very well made and interesting.
__label__1	"Misses the Mark: I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these ""critically acclaimed"" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying ""What?"""
__label__1	Beyond Weirdness: This subtitled film portrays the emotional deterioration and sexual perversions of an otherwise gifted and attractive professor of music. Includes scenes of mother-daughter incest, genital self-mutilation, suicide and recurrent sadomasochism. Despite all of this rarely seen pathology, this is very little excitement or entertainment value inherent in this film. Needless-to-say, a bit on the depressing side.
__label__1	Quite funny: Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John.
__label__1	repugnant at best: Well-acted for the most part, it was a relief to turn this movie off. The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape. This is one of those ugly movies that defiles the consciousness of its viewers with no higher purpose - artistic or philosophic. Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer.
__label__1	Pretentious bore: Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie.
__label__1	I think I'll go back and hide behind Clementi: I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music. I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was.
__label__2	Mostly quite good.: The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better.
__label__2	Difficult Parents quality: This text was in good shape, no bent pages, marks, etc. It also came quickly before I needed it for my class...and I'm based in China too. So was a good purchase overall!
__label__1	Doen't fit to DCR-PC55: This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It won't fit into the camcorder. The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50.The information about the battery is misleading. It states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55, which is not correct. This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55's battery bay.
__label__1	It's not evil, it's just pretty boring: Giving Sarah a lift from Loch Ness to London, the TARDIS picks up a distress signal and the Doctor lands the ship on Zeta Minor, a planet on the very edge of the universe. On this planet, an expedition seeking a new energy source has lost all but one of its members.However, when the Morestran Empire rescue expedition arrives, the Doctor and Sarah are prime suspects as the mysterious killers. But the planet has a very large secret, one which threatens the whole universe...'The Planet of Evil' is one of those Doctor Who serials that so many people seem to love, but which leaves me cold (perhaps not a surprise, as it was written by Louis Marks, who also wrote 'Inferno', which falls into the same category. Novelisation hasn't greatly improved the story in my eyes, and deprives us of the wonderful Zeta Minor jungle set.If you like 'Inferno', you'll probably like this one far more than me.
__label__2	One Of My Wife's Favorites: My wife really loves this movie, and I was happy to buy it for her for Valentine's Day. It seemed an appropriate gift, since the movie is essentially a love story. As I hoped, she loved it, along with the chocolates and mushy card. That said, in my opinion, Alec Guinness is completely unconvincing as an oriental, even though he is one of the most celebrated actors of all time. Couldn't they have found a real Chinese guy to play the part? But the cantankerous Rosalind Russell was perfect for her role, and played it to the hilt. I can't say I'm a fan of the movie, but because of my wife's love of it, it was a big hit at our house.
__label__1	Unbelievable: This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. It fails utterly. Guinness is badly miscast, looking about as Japanese as, say, Robert Morley. Rosalind Russell is barely plausible as a Jewish mother. The movie lacks wit, humor, sophistication, action, and suspense. It's basically a soap opera with lots of preaching about the brotherhood of man (oops, humankind). It's no surprise to me that the film has not been released on DVD. No one needs to waste time like that. Put this one in your Turkey book.
__label__1	BUYERS BEWARE! BOOTLEG OFFERING: This film has not been issued on DVD. This listing was created by a bootlegger, selling home-made copies.
__label__2	DON'T TOUCH MY MOUSTACHE: I love this movie! It is a tender and funny movie. Rosalind Russell (Mrs. Jacoby) shares her jewish traditions with a Japanese gentleman while in Japan. It is about how racism can be overcome by gentle understanding. How graceful times were. Truly a gem!
__label__1	"Beware DVD-R copies: This is the second time I have ordered a movie manufactured ""on demand"" in a DVD-R format from Amazon.com. My Sony DVD recorder/player is less than two years old. When I attempted to play each movie on the Sony, this message was displayed: ""Error. This disk cannot be played"". I have never had problems with movies that are manufactured directly by the studio so I assume that the middleman responsible for making these DVD-R copies is unreliable. Anyway, I am very disappointed."
__label__2	Finally on dvd: I have been waiting for this movie to hit dvd for years.I was surprised by the price .You can get this movie fromWarner Bros website for only $19.95.Why is Amazon making us by this dvd from a second party?When I get this dvd I will write a review.The wb website says this dvd has NOT been digitally remasteredfor this dvd.Hope this helps
__label__1	A Majority of One DVD-R movie: If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One
__label__2	"A dear old friend: Never mind that Alec Guinness plays a Japanese businessman. He does so well, you forget after awhile that he doesn't look Japanese.This film, which came out in the very early 60's I think, is based on a play by Leonard Spiegelgass. Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its ""modernity,"" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I'm so glad this film has finally been put on DVD."
__label__2	"a majority of one: I've loved this movie forever...watched my old VHS so much that it was beginning to look like a moth eaten rug!As 'Bertha' says [played by Rosiland Russell], ""It's like a Travel-log!""...a very interesting peek at the post-WWIIprocess of Japanese/American cultural assimilation as seen from the American perspective.Being a 'Trekkie' forever, too...see if you can 'spot' a young George Takei! And, Mr Takei reported in his marvelousAutobiography that Sir Alec Guinness had an awful Japanese 'accent'... to which I say = unless you're Japanese,you'll never know it....It's just great Guinness, great Russell, great Takei, other great character actors = a marvelous film!I decidid to 'treat' myself to a new movie...DVD this time...for many more years of enjoyment!"
__label__2	"A Majority of one: I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
__label__2	A Majority Of One: This movie is a Classic! So Glad to have found it:) They just don't make movies like this any more.
__label__2	A Majority of One: This movie is just wonderful. Very enlightening, entertaining and humorous. Helps people understand boundaries. I have watched it several times and so have some of my friends. Highly recommend.
__label__2	A Majority of One: This is one of my favorite movies. Rosalind Russell and Alex Guinness are just wonderful in it. Great movie!! I am so glad that is finally available on DVD. Thank you Amazon.
__label__2	Please someone stop me thinking that Green Thoughts is GREAT: I found this cd through some random thrift shop pillaging and have been praising the heavens ever since. Green Thoughts is one of those albums that are so amazingly catchy and beautiful to the ears you have to listen to it on repeat ten-thousand times over.The tracks on Green Thoughts focus around heartache but despite their emo-esque titles (i.e. Drown In My Own Tears, Deep Black, If The Sun Dosen't Shine) its amazingly accessible 1987 vibe puts across more than just the loneliness of a relationship gone sour. Green Thoughts is The Car's with soul and and Elvis Costello with power chords.If you happen to be looking for an album with some beautiful melody and heartfelt lyrics, Green Thoughts is where it's at. It really is incredible.
__label__2	Great band!: Video killed the Radio Star. If this music came out in 1968, this band would have been a headline act. However in the MTV world, if your not pretty, you don't play. I recommend these guys to everyone.
__label__2	"Variedad: Bueno tener este album debido a su sonido peculiar, algunas de sus canciones hasta fueron programadas aca en la radio en Guanatos...es + el Kala (Rostros Ocultos) se encargó de hacer un cover el cual fue un exito en español - con los Smithreens nunca lo fue - (""Tiempo de Cambiar"" o ""Something New""). Saludos de neta. Mork"
__label__1	Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!: This CD set is false advertising. On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road.
__label__1	Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children: This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.

__label__1	"Not a very positive book: I bought this book to read to my son's first grade class for Valentine's Day. I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne ""investigates"" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable."
__label__1	"0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!: This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. ""Tower of Blood"" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"
__label__1	the bottom below the false bottom of the barrel: This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it. No scares, no suspense, nuthin. Rock bottom.
__label__1	"One star and that is being gracious!: Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."
__label__1	"More like ""Tower of Feces""!!!: This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
__label__1	not proof read: This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book.
__label__1	Had to return it: Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn't charge it without the cycle turning itself off. The size & fit were good; it just wouldn't take a charge.
__label__1	Doesn't warm bottles: Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product.
__label__1	doesn't work for me: I have regular avent bottles, and I seriously need to warm the bottle up for 30 mins just to take thechill off, the. Warmer gets hot, it just doesn't warm the bottle up....I would not use this warmer for avent bottles imo
__label__1	to long to warm: where to begin, this product takes atleast 10 to 15 minutes to warm up a 4ounce bottle, and anyone with a small infant that is hungry knows this is entirely to long, would not recomment this to new parents at all, I now take a reusable bottle and fill with hot water and use that to warm up bottles
__label__1	It doesn't even get warm to the touch, much less heat a bottle!: We got this for on the go use and it doesn't even warm up to the touch. It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :(
__label__1	"it is a joke: this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
__label__1	WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!: I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. I plugged this in and waited almost 20min with a screaming baby and the formula was almost as cold as it was when I started. Huge waste of money!!!1
__label__1	Don't overheat your bottle!: The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer.
__label__1	I'd pass on this one: This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!
__label__1	Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles: I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
__label__1	So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!: Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
__label__1	Didn't warm at all!!: It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!
__label__1	Don't waste your money: I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!
__label__1	Takes FOREVER: I noticed some reviews saying this bottle warmer got so hot, it started fires. Well in our case it didn't. We got this because we had a newborn the week of Thanksgiving, and it gets really cold here between Oct-March, and being on the go frequently for the holidays, thought it would be a nice convenience to heat bottles in the car. After 45 minutes, the bottle wasn't even room temperature. I could have gotten it hotter placing it in my hands, or between my thighs. I thought maybe it wasn't placed correctly and didn't depress the activation button, gave it a few more tries but it never worked well.With the unpredictability of this product, between fire-starting the other reviews have stated and not even doing a darn thing in my case, I wouldn't get it. Very disappointed because now with 3 kids all under the age of 3, I have grown to like the Munchkin brand, but they really dropped the ball on this one.
__label__2	Chilling & Fast Paced: As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox & Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller.

__label__2	I guess Cali Iz Active: Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop put out a pretty impressive album which starts out great with the self named track Cali Iz Active. After that the lyricism and delvery is pretty good but not the best it could be. This album is still very impressive though with some great beats and appearances by some of the best in the business. Overall this album is better than Young Joc and his attempt at rap or other wannabe rappers from the ATL. This album is definitely worth your money.
__label__1	Tha Dogg Pound: This album absolutely sucked. They are still living off of Dr. Dre's scraps from '94. Seriously ever since Snoop sold out and became some wanna be 1970's style pimp, he has dropped off the map as far as importance to the rap game. Kurupt and Daz still have a little bit in the tank, but not enough to warrant buying this album. Anyone who says this album is good is only kidding themselves. Best advice: Keep away from this one and buy something else.
__label__1	Cali iz inactive: Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album.
__label__1	title track was cool&then the rest is a Coaster: Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but they lost there Groove long ago. the flows are tired&there are too many hands on the Production end. seems to be going through the motions&hoping to catch somebody feeling the vibe,but you just can't recapture where things were at back in the day. Snoop is just hall passing these days so him being on cruise control here comes as no suprise.
__label__2	Impressive: I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!
__label__1	Save your money: I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped.
__label__1	"Don't bother buying this one: After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a ""menu decoder"" when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books. Try to find something else."
__label__2	"A lot of useful info in a very small book: This is a very compact book, easily carried in a shirt pocket. Which makes it all the more impressive considering the amount of information that is contains. My only real complaint of the book is that though it is organized into sections like ""checking into a hotel"" or ""ordering food"" it can sometimes be difficult to find the phrase you are looking for at the time you need it. However, after having made a few trips to Thailand now, I now realize how good this book is. What I would recommend is that you read through the book before you travel and highlight key phrases you think you might use. Normally, for a phrasebook that might be painful to try to read through it, but this book has a lot of interesting information on Thai culture, customs, food, history, etc. that it isn't simply a list of phrases or a dictionary. And if you are like me and a little slow to pick up languages, you will find the book even more useful after a few trips to Thailand."
__label__2	america the Beautiful: this book works great for teaching the song. The hardback cover is great for multiple uses.
__label__2	Beautiful book!!: The illustrations are just beautiful, I will use the book to teach my students the beautiful song of the same title.
__label__2	It has wondeful illustrations.: The book has good illustrations and it has the song five times. The illustrations go very nicely with the words to the song.
__label__1	"It really had potential, but....: Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."
__label__1	A harlequin romance set a sex club: I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq.
__label__2	Good Book!: I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own. If you are a fan, I would recommend adding this one.
__label__2	"~ Erotic Fantasy ~: This is a lovely erotic fantasy. There are glimpses of BDSM but it is not ""hardcore"".Do not compare this book to the movie of the same name ~ The movie version is camped up & changed to make the story light & funny ~ The actual story in this book is not light and not funny, it is more of a complicated romance, between two people who don't realize how much they need each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hopefully, you will too ~ and if you do, you may seriously want to pick up the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy."
__label__1	"Only if you liked the Movie: If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is ""doing him""."
__label__2	hot: Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library. Other favorites are her Sleeping Beauty series. Definitely not for the prudish. She has the ability to pull you in and connect to the characters. I couldn't put them down!
__label__1	"Needs more to it.: I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
__label__1	Trashy: I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it.
__label__1	Not what I expected: This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there.
__label__2	"A glimpse into the real world of s/m play.: An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible ""players"". Don't try this one at home!"
__label__2	"An erotic love story for Nineties.: I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious ""happy ending"" reasons but also for the ""bring you back down to earth"" feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day."
__label__1	"Dissapointing: Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. This story I found to be much to long and tedious. The concept of a ""bondage vacation "" was much to comical and contrived. If erotica is what you want to read pick up an Anais Nin book. Anybody that can read her work without starting to get a rapid heartbeat is gotta be senseless!!"
__label__2	Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD: A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!
__label__1	Not her best work.: I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here.
__label__1	"One erotic passage in the entire book.: I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the ""Club"". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."
__label__1	I was extremely disappointed!: The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it.
__label__1	One Of The Worst Anne Rice Books!: I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!
__label__1	some books suffer from abridgement: The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also.
__label__1	Not what I expected...: This book wasn't what I expected; never read an Anne Rice, but after reading what others had written, thought I'd buy a book of hers.Should have saved my money; this story was too far-fetched. Didn't finish it.
__label__1	What was this....trash is what it is!!: I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!
__label__1	"Disallusion: I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men ""whipping"" someone for reasons I can't fathom. To dicipline, arouse ,or to train them; it escapes me. Too 'kinky' for my taste. In all fairness, I never made it past the first few chapters either in this book or the first of Sleepy Beauty's triology. The theme was obvious. I will assume there is a message in these books but I didn't care to find it. I gave this 1 star because it was required to submit the review. Rereading this, this review DOES make me SOUND like a prude! In synopsis, if you like whips and chains and that sort of thing, you like the book; if not don't waste your money. I don't even want to donate them to our local library."
__label__1	"Not Sleeping Beauty: I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her ""Sleeping Beauty"" series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."
__label__1	Let down...: It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels.
__label__1	"Pathetically bad!: This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
__label__2	Magical Adventure: Anita Jeram's book, I Love My Little Storybook, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. The illustrations are magical and whimsical. As a reader or a listener, it's easy to wish yourself into this magical world of adventure. It's a wonderful bedtime story and has become a favorite to give as a gift to other children and expectant mothers.
__label__2	Vexx is very good: I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(...). Like many of the reviews have already mentioned, this game is excellent! Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete.
__label__2	"Great Game: This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard! You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way. You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line ""poems"" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated ""T"" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it."
__label__1	cheap cheap cheap...: I fell in love with the print on a set of 250 thread count Tommy Hilfiger sheets, so I bought two sets of twin size at $15.99 for each sheet. I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste.
__label__1	The title gives it away: A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history.
__label__1	Wax coating and taste: I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I'm missing out on something. The Zoe bars are a major disappointment. The roof of my mouth feels like it is coated with a grainy wax when I finish eating the bars. Unless you enjoy wax, spend your money on many good alternative bars and skip the Zoe's.
__label__2	Lose Weight, Feel Better, Eat Right, Get Omega 3's and More: I am absolutely addicted to this flavor as well as all of the other bar flavors. This is my breakfast, afternoon pickup or even sometimes my on the go lunch! I am never hungry when I eat my Zoe's Bars!
__label__1	Not a fan of these: I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually.
__label__1	Didn't like them: The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor, with a strange aftertaste. They are filling though, but then again so is eating compressed cardboard!
__label__2	spirited: My brother lives in Bangkok and I've been there many times so I was keen to see what a novel set there would be like and I wasn't disappointed - Mr Moore evokes the seediness and poverty without it appearing soul-destroyingly hopeless because he manages to balance it with interesting characters (both the good, the bad and the humanly flawed), a good mystery and moments of beauty and humour. I enjoyed it and intend to try the next one...
__label__1	"Gets better over time: I almost gave up reading this book after a couple of chapters for the same reasons as the 1-star reviewers. I can't say I care for the writing style. It reminds me of the ""Guy Noir"" skit on ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which is, of course, supposed to be a funny take-off on these kinds of books. The protagonist seemed to be more of a stereotypical formula rather than a real person. I struggled up through Chapter 9. Then I began to get more invested in the story. I think the writing began to improve a bit and the characters gained some dimension. Still, it ends up being 2 stars for me. Perhaps his later books are better?"
__label__1	One of the worst books I've ever read....: I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book.
__label__1	"So bad: This is simply terrible... It is badly written, a ""cutsy"" attempt to be the typical hard-boiled detective. Not even worth the free download."
__label__1	sorry....: Sorry, I couldn't get into this one at all. If you want to read some GOOD thrillers located in Bangkok, try John Burdett's books beginning with Bangkok 8.
__label__1	What the heck is up with this cover?: 'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?
__label__1	The worst book ever written.: Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would.
__label__1	"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read: This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."
__label__2	Wonderful feminist novel: This is a great, imaginative book, one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
__label__1	"Not Deserving of its Clout: I know that ""Herland"" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend ""Herland"" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at ""social housekeeping"" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."
__label__1	Wrong book: wrong book sent. Customer service was poor and presented an extremely difficult procedure for correcting the problem. I was required to pay to send the book back, mailing back cost almost as the book itself. Even complying with this process did not ensure a replacement, but only that the order would be checked.
__label__2	Good book but took forever to get to me: I ordered this book in March and did not receive it until June, way too long to wait for a book. The book itself is great, when it finally arrived it was in good condition. This book was recommended by one of my college professors for people who were interested in more of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works, and is basically a utopian society novel.
__label__2	"A sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child: ""A Campfire for Cowboy Billy"" is not only a charming tale, it's a resonant one. Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."
__label__1	"This book is hard to understand: This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."
__label__1	Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding: If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet.
__label__1	takes a wrong turn: fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared.
__label__1	Skip 451: Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed.
__label__1	Hated it: could not stand this book. hated everything about it. waste of my time reading it. maybe just too out of date for today.
__label__1	Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz: This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again.
__label__2	If you want action, dont read this: If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases.
__label__1	blah: I had to read this for school. The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class. Montag's wife was annoying to me and Bradbury's ideas are really intersting. Too bad he can't write his way out of a paper bag. This book was a waste of time. Never read it unless its required and theres a test on it. Then you could make an exception, I guess.
__label__1	"This book is not ""hot."": I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew ""Fahrenheit 451"" was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Well, I hated it. I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help! Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible? There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either! I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently. I do not recommend this book!"
__label__1	fahrenheit 451: the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
__label__1	In My Opinion....: Fahrenheit 451 lists in my top 5 of worst books ever. my english class had to read it. i didnt even read the lastsection. by the time the first test rolled around, i hadnt even read 10 pages. i evenually forced myself to read it but stopped when i got to last section cause i thought if i read anymore, i might die. i felt no connection to the characters, no emotion towards them. Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid. For u, many ur will like it. Maybe not. Cant no until u attempt to read it(NOTE: i said attempt)
__label__1	Bad written - Wasted money: I think this book isn't worth the money you pay for it. Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it.
__label__1	The usual dreck: I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!
__label__1	"This book was very boring: I had to read this book for school, and it is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are three sections, and all that the main character, Montag does in the first section is meet a girl named Clarisse and talks to her once or twice and starts ""considering"" his job as a fireman burning books. This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring. There are so many metaphors and stuff that it is so hard to understand the story.While I hated this book, if you're the kind of person who likes sci-fi books with a lot of metaphors, then you should read Fahrenheit 451."
__label__1	"Read this book ..... if you want a good nap!!: Before I was forced to read this book by my eigth grade reading teacher, I had heard from people that it was pretty amazing and thought provoking. They were wrong. The only credit I can give this book is that it is the only one that has ever made me fall asleep. Its inconsistent plot and awful use of surreal events were written down in a rambling, incoherent jumble of thoghts, even if you can call them that. Even if it had any type of meaning or hidden morale, this supposed ""work of art"" was unbearably boring and slow. Maybe I'm not yet old enough to be able to pick out any real substance from the book's paragraph after paragraph of *@#$, but I do applaud anyone who had the strength to get past the first chapter. I end my review with some ""poetic justice"" of my own... I burned this book!!!"
__label__1	This book sucked: This book sucked. I am forced to read this for my 9th grade accelerated english class and it is boring. You can guess what's gonna happen next throughout the whole book. It makes no real attempt to make a statment on book burnings.
__label__1	"Please burn THIS book!!!: Too bad this book wasn't included among Montag's targets during his career as a ""fireman."" He sure would have done us all a big favor by sparing us the agony of trying to trudge through this trash. Life is too short ... don't waste one minute with this no-brainer!"
__label__1	DONT READ THIS BOOK: Ray Bradbury tries to write a bestseller in this boring novel. He keeps the audience in the book for about three pages, then everyone falls asleep. If he could do it again, I think he should have never written books in the first place.
__label__1	This book is boring!: This book doesn't deserve a maximum of 1,000 words! It is pointless and inconsistent. Don't read it! How could our society ever become one not dependent on books for knowledge and wisdom?
__label__1	this book was awful: This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
__label__1	A Bad Book: The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest.
__label__1	This book was really odd..........: This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451 was a good book but hard to follow: I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge. I had a very hard time putting the book down. Fahrenheit 451 was a lot like our socity today. Instead of putting out fires firemen started them. That strange twist was what I liked most about the book. I deducted a half star because it was a little hard to follow.
__label__2	"Reality check in a world that needs it: It's amazing how a book that was written nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any reader, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder ""what makes this such a good book?"" I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"
__label__2	Among the Best Ever: Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it. If you can only read one book your entire life, make it this one. It is the masterpeice of the modern era from the man I would consider its finest writer.
__label__2	Fahrenheit: This is perhaps the most thought provoking book I have ever read. Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar.
__label__2	The Hearth and the Salamander: A future in which books are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn.
__label__2	The Hearth and the Salamander: Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots.
__label__2	"Scarier than LIFE: Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society. We have everything ever dreamed of, and we have barely begun. By letting ""..451"" into you're mind, one realizes that this fiction, is not justly so. It is apparent in our realm that this fable has already begun to happen. Change is something not always noticed. However, this book opened my eye's to to the world around me. I am certain, that ""Guy Montag"" the charachter, is in all of us. Just waiting to be discovered."
__label__2	Censorship has never felt so real...: This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is.
__label__2	Critical View: Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy.
__label__2	Is this where we're headed?: Another book I read as a young man and dismissed. The book is so spot on. The difference is people tend to be obsessed with PDAs not walls in their homes.
__label__2	"A Scary Preview of the future of American Society: I first read this book after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting ready to have her students read Farenheit 451. I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read ""Farenheit 451"" and see for yourself. It is a definite eye opener that sends chills thorugh my body everytime I read it."
__label__2	Great Book: The author did a great job. It is a Very high reading in my opinion. Little complex storyline, but very great story!
__label__2	Fascinating!: I started writing sci fi because of this book. Actually had the honor of seeing Ray Bradbury speak- LIVE - (yea, I know, it was eons ago) - but I hadn't read anything he had written before that speech. I got a copy of this book shoved into my chest just after that speech, and couldn't put it down. A marvelous read. And a must read for anyone who wants to understand how things can go wrong in society, and to get a glimpse of the cleverness of the human spirit. I'd say this is a must read for everyone!
__label__2	Good book: This is definitely a well written book. It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK.
__label__2	"Amazing: I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the book interesting for me. Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using ""firemen"" to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."
__label__2	I generally liked this book.: This book is exceptional in its portrayal of the future. Yet, it is slow for the few chapters. If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!
__label__2	Engaging fast read: Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments.
__label__2	"A Classic...: After reading ""The Time Machine"" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything ""upsetting"" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."
__label__2	An Eye-opener: This book is so relevant to today that it is scary. It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books.
__label__2	Fiction?: I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it.
__label__2	Insightful: It is simply amazing how, for a book written so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age...It does make you wonder...and makes you more aware of your own behaviors.
__label__2	good..: I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books....
__label__2	"Not 1984: I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called ""The end of all Utopias"" because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"
__label__1	eBooks: In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper.
__label__1	Useless that text to speech is not enabled!: Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per
__label__1	Target Practice: Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read. A worthless good for nothing piece of junk! Actually it is good for something. I took this book with me to rifle practice and i shot at this instead of the target. I got busted but hey it was worth it. Mail me if you want a picture of my shooting.
__label__1	A very disappointing book: I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence.
__label__1	The Worst Book Ever!: Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!
__label__1	Horrible book: This was the worst book I've ever read. Most of the book was just saying the exact same thing a million different ways. It was an interesting idea behind the book, but it was altogether boring the way it was written.
__label__2	"wake-up call: Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their ""ideas"" or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged,"" McCrae's ""Bark of the Dogwood,"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"") ""Fahrenheit 451"" took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as ""fiction."" How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."
__label__2	"Orwell's shadow: 'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to ""help"" the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"
__label__1	I know it's a classic, but I was not impressed.: Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did.
__label__1	"ATTENTION TEACHERS!: I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School. It's no wonder, with book selections like these, that students don't read and are illiterate."
__label__1	CD Fahrenheit 451: I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious.
__label__2	Timeless Classic!: Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic.
__label__2	Optimistic as humans can be, but well thought.: The book was one of the best that I have ever read yet, it is the same mumbo jumbo that humans will always find th right way. That our race will always survive, conqor evils, and destroy evil doers.
__label__2	RB did a great job describing why censorship is wrong: Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past.
__label__2	"Simple but Perfect: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is one of those rare books that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."
__label__2	"I've always had trouble reading: I've always had trouble reading but when I read this book for my English 2 class I loved it. It was a very good book. My fav line is... ""Ask not for sucurity, there never was such an animal, and if there was it would be related to the sloth which spends its time hangin upside down in a tree""""To hell with that, I say, kick the tree and knock the sloth on his @$$!"" Must READ! I wrote an essay on this book and got an A!"
__label__2	A decent book, I see somwhat related to 1984: It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today.
__label__2	The father of science fiction and fantasy: Great book read it when i was a teen, along with all his other books.Bought it as a gift for an aspireing writer
__label__2	Great book: All theses years later this book still holds up. Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone. Somebody should do a modern movie remake of this story.
__label__2	Fantastic book!: I had to read this book while I was in high school and I'm glad I did! This turned out to be my favorite book. Great story and very thought-provoking.Highly recommended.
__label__2	Ray is a philosopher.: The message is clear.Burn the words to cover-up and control society through censorship -vs- the fire for warmth, and light for learning. Let the people make up their own minds as to which helps or hinders them.Truth, actually keeps a society in a better position (no-matter how much it seems to hurt in the present) than any ideal forward pushing utopian lies...It is a great book, and Ray's real purpose/philosophy point blankly shines in the later chapters.Thats my broadbrushstroked opinion. Amazon does not offer fine lines concerning gold stars. If they did, I would rate it 4.625
__label__2	This book changed the way I look at all books.: Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!
__label__2	My personal worst nightmare: This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think.
__label__2	Burning Books!: This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook.
__label__2	How Fitting...: I'm 54 years old and I am reading this for the first time ever...on my Kindle. How very fitting, and ironic that Mr. Bradbury, who is openly against e-books, the internet and such, would agree to release Fahrenheit 451, a cautionary that centers around why real books are important, and what could happen at their demise, as an e-book.Just a thought...
__label__2	"Intricate, Prophetic, Beautiful: I really loved this book. I'm sure the average reader will, too. Bradbury's prose is rich in metaphors and images and most of all, you capture his intent and feeling that he perfectly places in every moment of the book.The world the book is set it is ironically similar to ours today, and I find it kind of funny how Mildred is so incredibly similar to some people I know myself.Science Fiction is a label and this book is more of a homily. It's an important read because it asks so many questions...how does Our America compare to his?Read this book and decide for yourself...are you in progress and on track to being in a ""parlor family"" or are you curious enough to learn and love the World we live in."
__label__2	FAHRENHEIT 451: A Book That Will Burn Your Mind: Fahrenheit 451. The temperature at which books catch fire and burn.Odd title, but not as odd as the story itself. The community in which this story takes place seems strange, but it's shockingly similar to our own. Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do? Find out by reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.
__label__1	"Not worth reading: This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
__label__1	"Thoroughly Disapointed: This book is a is written about a futuristic civilization in which books are burned and anyone who is caught reading gets arrested (or worse). The main character is a ""fireman"" named Guy Montag who begins to realise that books are'nt really so bad, and he rebels. Firemen in this society don't put out fires, they burn the books. The storyline is slow and depressing. The book is rather boring, to put it politely. I believe that this is the only book that should be burned. DON'T BOTHER."
__label__1	An ok book: It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom.: After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away.
__label__1	THIS BOOKS STINKS: I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book.
__label__1	BURN THIS BOOK!!!: I was FORCED to read this book in school! It was pure TRASH! I thought I liked reading... well now Idont! Thanks a lot Ray Bradbury!!!
__label__1	It Deserves Negative Stars!: Last year we had to read this as a class. There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one.
__label__1	fahrenheit 451: I order the book a week before it shipped and then took so long to get here I had to download the book to my daughters Kindle the night before she needed it for school. That cost me $9.99, and then got the book on the 4th or 5th of February. Won't use this one again.
__label__1	"smart idea but...: Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and ""appetizing"":a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."
__label__1	Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!: I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking.
__label__1	Disappointed: Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn't get through this book. Perhaps I needed a teacher to help me get the symbolism!
__label__1	Too obvious for even young readers: I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting.
__label__2	Great buy: Great buy. The book came as described and in a timely fashion. I will order from them again.
__label__1	Horrible!: I have never yet received my order, and it has been a month since I placed the order and paid for it. Will I be getting a refund of my money?
__label__1	Horrible execution of an addressable topic...: This book is quite possibly the worst piece of science fiction I have read... It is dramatically boring and far too contrived to be interesting... The world Bradbury creates is thoroughly dry and I simply hated his look at the future... Nothing was at all interesting or thought-provoking, except for the books examination into the issues of censorship as a whole. I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly....
__label__1	Never Received: I never received the product in the mail. Needed it for summer reading for school and had to go to the bookstore to buy it.
__label__1	Horrible and boring: it is impossible to keep reading this...it is very hard to understand and most parts don't make any sense...it is very hard to understand.
__label__1	How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME?: To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves. If Bradbury wanted us to realize the importance of books, the LEAST he could do was make this book SEMI-interesting! Essentially: Don't waste your time.
__label__1	Not worth it: I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me.
__label__1	"Overrated!: I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't. I know that there are some good points to it, but not enought to sit and read it over and over again.PS-If you don't agree with me, please don't click the ""No"" button below."
__label__1	Was not the best book i have ever read.: Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't.
__label__1	A Time Waste: Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
__label__1	The book is not the best!: It is not the best book I have read. It was really weird and freaky. The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was really a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like. Although this book does not fit my categories or my type of books, I would not recommend it to other people who like serious stuff.
__label__1	HATED IT!: I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently.
__label__1	Confusing: who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
__label__1	Horrible: This book was way too weird for me and there was never a hook of curiosity. I was assigned to read this for school so that is the only reason i continued to read to the end. It made no sense and was very dull.
__label__2	Brought it all back: My older sister had to read this book for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old. She left it sitting around and one rainy summer day back in the 70's I picked it up and was hooked. I read everything Bradbury wrote like a warm knife going through butter. My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so. Should still be required reading in our schools. Thank you Ray Bradbury for the worlds you created, they were wonderful places to visit!
__label__2	Still Relevent: Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas.
__label__2	A Great Read...Thank you!: Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance.
__label__2	"A testament to all of the Guy Montags out there.....: This book is a classic on censorship. It also probes at human values and is almost existential in Guy's conflict over the wrong he feels is being committed in the burning of the books. This could even be a chapter out of Huxley's ""Brave New World"" in that the public is conditioned by what they can and cannot read through censorship. An essential for anyone."
__label__2	perspective changer: I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book.
__label__2	one of the best: This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there.
__label__2	glimmery and grey: this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile.
__label__2	This book burns your brain!: This excellent book captures a society unlike any other. In this world, books are outlawed. If you are caught with them, you are jailed and the books are burned. Guy Montag, who is the protaginist of the story, is a firefighter. However, instead of putting out fires, he starts them. He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything. This winds up getting him in trouble. However, in the end this works out for the best. We definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to burn their brain. For under six bucks, you can get a great thriller.
__label__2	This book is a must for society: This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!
__label__2	"Eye-opening & Spellbinding!!: This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who ""just don't get it"" I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!"
__label__2	Interesting novel!: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!
__label__2	Great Book!: I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!
__label__2	"Farhenheit 451 The book about no books: Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books ""Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up. Society agrees with this because they don't want to break the law.This book's in depth descriptions are so good they pull you in and its like your there. Farenheit 451 will fill you with a new way of looking at things."
__label__2	School Assignment: I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad. Besides that I enjoyed this science-fiction which has a strong resemblence to the Giver by Lois Lowry.
__label__2	Good Value: This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his reading list. It was an excellent used copy and a great value for the money.
__label__2	"Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, is a book that attacks what our society is becoming. Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble. Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes the reader think ""What really is important in my life?"""
__label__2	"Better than I remembered: I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
__label__2	Oh my goodness....: To reread these classics and then see how current and relevant it is for today is amazing. Parlor and screens, Internet and Facebook. Value of justice and human life each placed below entertainment all to be wiped clean and reset. We are all poorer at the loss of the author.
__label__2	Bradbury at his best: This was Bradbury's best book. He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed.
__label__2	Extremely Thought Provoking: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book. If the reader dives beneath the surface of this book, they will get a whole lot more from this book than they would from a cheesy love story.
__label__2	"Alarmingly realistic: Bradbury is a master of the genre. In ""Fahrenheit 451"", he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as ""knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength"". He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie. Not to be missed"
__label__1	Ultra-overrated: I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this.
__label__1	Simplistic Viewpoints: While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept.
__label__2	Great: This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight. Words of warning for the present and future.
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451 Review: I originally purchased the Metric edition, Celsius 232.778. I was thoroughly disappointed. Reading the original was a breath of fresh air, even if it wasn't as renown by the International Organization for Standardization.
__label__2	A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. I thought this book had a good plot, but it was kind of hard fo me to understand. Some of the parts of the book I had to read three or four times to figure it out. Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else.
__label__2	F. 451: I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well.
__label__2	Strong message and beautiful to read: I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I had heard people talk of it forever and always put it in my mind as a book to read, but I didn't think that it would necessarily be an enjoyable read. I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book. (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)So about the book... It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read. The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story. This book is pretty short. I think it is a must read for anyone. I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!
__label__2	Disturbing...: One of the signs of a great book, in my opinion, is that it disturbs you - twists with your emotions and never leaves you. More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood.
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out. This book by Ray Bradbury exposes you to why books are very important. A must read.
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: Ray Bradbury did well done job. this book exposes you to why books are so valuable. Reading is a gift from God. If you have not read it yet, you must because you are missing out on a terrific story.
__label__2	"Fahrenheit 451: I chose this book because I have read Ray's books before and enoyed them. The title seemed interesting, so I took it. His style of writing can be confusing, so you must concentrate while reading. I gave this book a ""thumbs up"" because it had an unexpected ending."
__label__2	Read this book: Amazingly written!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. The book was intriguing, and suspenseful. When I read it I couldn't put it down!
__label__2	Great book for today: It seemed at first that the book was too far-fetched, that It could never happen. However the more I read the more I saw connections to life today. In many ways it has been very prophetic. It basically displays what happens when a culture values convenience and comfort over honesty and truth.great read, recommend it to anyone.
__label__2	Sci-fi fantasy at its best!: I read this book in 8th grade as part of a requirement. I found the book to be excellently written and with an amazing plot line. You'll despise the hound while pondering Montag. I recommend this book for ANYONE who enjoys a bit of imagination.
__label__2	A confusing but exciting,well-written,and intellectual novel: A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think.
__label__2	A very hot read!: Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!
__label__2	"Classic audio book: The Audio book ""Fahrenheit 451"" was purchased by me as a gift for a friend who has limited eyesight. He reports that the book is of exceptional quality and very easy to use. I would recommend this book based on his comments. I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."
__label__2	A point driven home by a brilliant writer: While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation.
__label__2	Quick 'nd Good: A quick read with a big font, and only 170 pages, yet it was so good.A terrific story of a fireman who doesn't fit in with the rest of the group and then goes a stray.If the book has multiple introductions, prefaces or whatever only read one, (preferably the longest one) otherwise its just repetitive, though somewhat interesting.
__label__1	All books begin with a premise...: ... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood.
__label__1	Understanding: I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better. I suggest to read this book if you feel like you have time. If your into all that science fiction stuff then you would probably enjoy this book much more than i ever will in two lifetimes. Goodluck, you might need it!
__label__1	Awful and boring: It was one of the most boring books i have ever read in my life.Why everyone in this society is so narrow-minded.Mildred is the most stupid woman i have ever read for and beatty is one of the biggest liar.So i think Bradbury was probably drunk while he was writing this book.
__label__1	"A good idea gone horribly wrong!: At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
__label__1	How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled: How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses.
__label__1	"This is not a good or bad book, but its O.K: I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read. I will not recommend this book to my friends because it's boring. ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about Guy Montag, a fireman, who starts fire but does not putout fires. In this society, the fireman has to set up fires and burn the books. Usually when we hear ""fireman"", we always think about that their job is to put out fires. It is totally different than we thought, right? This book is about censorship, that is, people does not have the right to read. In that society, the firemen have the rights to burn. Not only books, but also the houses and people. In this book, an innocent woman who has being burn in her house with her books. How can the fireman has the right to burn a human life, a human life! Especially a book lover, How?"
__label__1	Disappointing. Does not deserve to be a 'classic': Length:: 3:49 MinsFahrenheit 451Fahrenheit 451: A Novel
__label__1	This book stunk!: Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living.
__label__1	"Turn the stove up to 451 degrees and throw this book in!: Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my ""burn this book"" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named ""GUY MONTAG"". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all ""offensive"" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the ""family"" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"
__label__1	Great book, bad performance: As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process.
__label__2	"Fine novel, but it's too short: Fahrenheit 451, is a fine novel. It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" or ""Brave New World"". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it's too short. It's kind of like a novella. While reading I was thinking whether there is an allusion to the tremendous fear or reds and the communists during the 50's in the U.S.?"
__label__1	"huge disappointment: at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
__label__1	What Did I Just Read: I don't think I'm too dense. But this book was either way over my head or I just did not appreciate it. It definitely got some good reviews, and it's one of those books that schools force upon you to read. So I gave it a shot. It was an interesting idea and a short read (thank god), but I didn't like how it ended. It kind of gave me the same feeling as Children of Men and The Giver. The Giver is one of my favorite books, so I did not come into this with a prejudice. I just thought it was a really bad book. I'm glad my high school never forced me to read it.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451: We thought this book was a good one, but it started out to be slow and confusing. It is about a person name Guy Montag and he is a firefighter that burns books. He is starting to find out that it is not a good job, and he wants to quiet. This is all i can say because if I tell you any more it will give the book away. I can tell you that this is a science-fiction book, and it involves a different society. This is what makes the book so great.In conclusion, this is a good book, and even though it is hard to read in the begining, it gets much better.Thanks for reading this.
__label__1	Too bad Amazon can't help out students: I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451 Audiobook: Some Authors should NOT read their books for the audio format. This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!
__label__1	"Burn it!: This book, whilst very good to begin with, fails in the end beacause Bradbury attemptes to beat his message in too late in the piece. He spends too much time describing the story, and his message, as he has rendered it, is too complex to cram into 180 pages. I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name ""clarrise"" for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo. But, other than that, i found it to be a tolerablebook, up until the death of beatty, when the novels plot development peters out, and we are left feeling cudgeled for the rest of the novel by its ""moral"" Im only 13, so nyah BURN THE BOOK! bradbury has failed miserably in creating this book."
__label__1	"My thouts of the book ""Fahrenheit 451"": I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!"
__label__1	NOT PLEASED: I was very disappointed when I received this book. I order it for my childs school project, the book could not be used. Most of the pages where underlined in black magic marker, which bleed through to the other sides and the book had notes written in the margins. Very displeased, I had to go to a bookstore and buy another book. Lesson well learned.
__label__2	"More than just sensorship...: The lessons learned from good authors are timeless. Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new ""Amber Alerts"" adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and ""editing"" are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.""I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book."""
__label__2	This is why censorship stinks!: This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book.
__label__1	The book shows a bleak vision of the future of the world: The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book .
__label__1	My Review: This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book.
__label__1	ahhh it is alright: this book was really boring and i had to read it for a book report so instead of me reading the whole book i just rented the movie from blockbuster and watched the movie it was much easier
__label__1	OK: The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
__label__1	Fell short of expectations&#65533;: I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me.
__label__1	An OK book: Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous.
__label__1	A major dissapointment: I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. So, I decided to read it. I was very dissapointed. Though some concepts were fairly interesting they were not developed, so book had no point. I cannot understand why this novel is as famous as it is. Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451, a review of: Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age.
__label__1	"There Are Better Dystopias Out There: This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, ""Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?"")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."
__label__1	A bit on the iffy side . . .: I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for class in eighth grade, and from the beginning, I knew this book would turn out be quite eloquent and philsosphical, but also extremely tedious. I almost fell asleep in some occasions. Bradbury does a good job describing sections in the story, but sometimes gets carried away and forgets about some mood. For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives. In conclusion, I struggled through the book and only read it out of coercion. I would never read this again.
__label__1	Overrated: I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it: This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic.
__label__2	Poignant and relevant still.: There isn't anything I could say that hasn't already been said in the last sixty years. It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world.
__label__2	A brightly burning insight just as important today: This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?
__label__2	"I HATE THE IDEA OF NO BOOKS!: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give ""Fahrenheit 451"" five big stars."
__label__2	FAHRENHEIT 451: Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction.
__label__2	Great!: I had to buy this book for school. At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down! I loved every description and foreshadowing, and how much of the technology was similar to today's, even though the book was written in the 1950's. I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!
__label__2	The BEST book i have ever read!!: I love this book. It is exciting and thrilling. I love the idea of people not being able to read books or think for them selfes. I think that this book should be read by all.
__label__2	"Relevance to our times: ""Fahrenheit 451"" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to.
__label__2	Feel the Heat of Words: I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy.
__label__2	Couldn't Put It Down!: I have never read a book anything like this before. Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars.
__label__2	emotional impact: This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you read this book in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag's pyche. This was a refreshing aspect after reading so many award winning books that seem to try too hard to force emotional impact upon the reader.
__label__2	One of Bradbury's best: I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned. I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now.
__label__2	"Skip the reviews; let's play the game!: Based on the reviews below, it appears that people either love or hate this book, so let's just play ""What book would you be?"" I would be ""The Great Gatsby."" Ok, your turn!"
__label__2	Why do teachers force reading down our throats?: The major complaint against this book, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to read works they don't understand. I couldnt agree more. Although I am a bibliophile, and found this book very interesting, I am also consious of the unique ability of english teachers to analyse books to death. This type of novel is one that will only speak to people who would read it voluntarily anyways - many people see nothing wrong with TV. If you love books, you will love this one. If you don't you won't
__label__2	Earth-Shattering: When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. But as I neared the end of the book, something struck me. This COULD be OUR future...if we didn't DO something. This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general.
__label__2	Well Worth The Time: If there is one book that you read in high school that you should read again later in life, this is it. In fact, I'm inclined to think that it shouldn't be taught until at least college because there is simply no way that any child in high school can truely appreciate this amazing novel. Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always.
__label__2	"captivating: As Montag's fire captain tells him, ""You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed."" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."
__label__2	"Dystopian classic: Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the ""media"" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence. Sound familiar? A little too familiar. I dare say that we seem to be heading towards an age where ignorance is not merely bliss but that knowledge is loudly discouraged. I can only hope I'm wrong.A great dystopian and a much deserved classic."
__label__1	Uckkk: I absolutly hated this book, It not only bored me but it aggervated me to the fullest. It wasn't realistic and the things that happen in the book were just stupid! Not to mention the main character's wife was just a moron, and who wants to burn books? I mean thats alittle odd, burning down houses because people owned books, ahhhhhhh, not a good book
__label__1	I DON'T UNDERSTAND...: I AM A FRESHMEN AND I WAS REQUIRED TO READ THIS BOOK.I AM ON PAGE 29. I DON'T GET A WORD I HAVE READ. I FEEL LIKE I'M READING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. MABY IT'S BECAUSE I'M YOUNG.OR BECAUSE I'M ONLY ON PAGE 29.ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M LOST.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO REVIEWED THIS BOOK. YOU HAVE HELPED ALOT.
__label__1	Painful listening: Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself.
__label__1	Poor audiobook: This may be a classic story, but Ray Bradbury is not a classic reader... I couldn't get through 5 minutes of his voice. I DO look forward to reading the actual book!
__label__1	Not up to par with Bradbury's other work: This is Ray Bradbury's worst book. I cannot believe ... a good writer bombs here. 1st, Clairsse McCellan, the only one who I like in the book ..., then the book skids downhill from there. 2nd, There is a lot of taking the Lord's name in vain, which is breaking a commadment and is a sin. Mr. Bradbury could do better.
__label__1	The Worst book I have ever read!!!!: This book was horribly written!! It confused more than it enlightened!!! I did not enjoy it at all and I never plan to read it again.
__label__1	DUMBEST BOOK EVER!!!!: You always here of classics being read by generation after generation, this isn't one of those. It should be burned itself. I can't believe i read this dumb book
__label__1	Wrong book sent!: I ordered a book for my grandson's school summer reading program. The book was supposed to be Fahrenheit 451 and I received a totally different book. I returned the book and by the time another book could be sent would be too late.I probably will not order from this site again.
__label__2	book, book, book: throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people. This book repersents the amount of learning that the people will be doing in the future of our county it tv will keep going as it is. the book is a good book it has the posibility of telling people what we will come to if we stop reading. There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self. Montag often feels his most revolutionary thoughts welling and circulating in his blood. thsi book kept me interested un till the end because you did not know what crazy thing was goin to go on next.
__label__2	A good read: I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing.
__label__1	The message is good but...: The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one.
__label__1	451 review by Jessica C.: when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451- Somewhat a flop: I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars.
__label__2	Alright, but sort of weird: Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book. I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother.
__label__2	A novel about fireman who are paid to set books ablaze: This book was very interesting to read. This was my first time reading about the issue of censorship. I had recently wrote an essay about censorship and with the help of this book clearly made it easier for me to understand the issue better.
__label__2	"Overrated. Only ""half"" as good.: I thought this book was going to be great since it is always on the teachers' lists of recommended readings. But I felt the story went a bit slow for me. The first half of the book, was not very interesting and it was a little confusing. But in the second half of the book the story really picks up. I would only recommend this book to people who like science fiction."
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451: I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come.
__label__1	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary.
__label__1	"Fahrenheit 451 review: The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered ""dangerous"" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."
__label__1	Expectations: Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works.
__label__2	Sci Fi Nightmare!: Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. In this book, Bradbury creates a powerful, disturbing imagery to ilustrate his distopia, which has bone-chilling similarities with our days. A must-read, even for those who are not Sci-Fi lovers. Why didn't I five-stared? Well, I didn't like the style so much, it could be more concise. Someone said that writing is the art of eliminating words, rather than adding them.
__label__2	Great book.: Let me preface this review with the statement that I was supposed to have read this book years ago, when I was still an English Major and for some reason or not I never got to it. I now understand why it is considered a must read and classic. Its a great book with such insight to our culture that I now regret greatly not reading it sooner.
__label__2	Superb!: This is an amazing book. I decided to read it when I found out that Mr. Bradbury had passed away.Even though it's supposed to be fiction, it seems way too familiar, since unfortunately there are so many people who prefer wasting their lives doing unimportant things rather than spending their time reading.I highly reccomend it.
__label__2	"Hurrah for Bradbury!: Art imitating life? One need only contemplate the depths of political correctness to see the coming new order. Utopian societies are hellish and brutally banal at the same time. Like Jerry Furland's terrifying novel ""Transfer - the end of the beginning"", Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" delivers a message and a vision of the future that is bleakly horrifying. You will devour both of these fine novels in a sitting. Guaranteed."
__label__2	Great read!: Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!
__label__2	Excellent: Reached in time for my daughter's school . My daughter enjoy it. It was for her course material so not much can be said.
__label__2	What an Interesting Book!: I read this book for a book club and I really enjoyed it. It was very thought provoking, and I am sure that we will have a lot to discuss. It didn't grab me into the book, I could set it down when I needed to, but it was still really good.
__label__2	Great BUT hard to follow.: This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read.
__label__2	"How could you give it less than five stars?: When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was ""Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest."" Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."
__label__2	Good Read: I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives.
__label__2	blame xmas for lateness: Orded two books in December, and got this one just the other day (it's now the end of January). Again this was done over Christmas when the Post Offices are clogged up with post. The book is in mint condition. Thanks!
__label__2	A Classic.: Ray Bradbury's 'Fahreneheit 451' is a classic that almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college. It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling.
__label__2	Fahrenheit 451: Review: In this book, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the book to our eyes. 451 takes place in a distant future far from our time. In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book. I would reccomend it for anyone who is willing to give it a try.
__label__2	"Farenheit 451: When I first started reading Farenheit 451, I thought this book was a little strange. But after reading more of the book, I became mezmorized by the graphic detail and colorful language.The way Ray Bradbury writes has a disturbing realism to it. He writes about the future, but his thoughts are centered around the present.Guy Montag was a fireman, not fighter. His job was to seek out books, and burn them. But his whole life changed when he met Clarisse. With three words, Guys life was turned upside down ""Are You Happy?"" Is he happy or has he been forced to be ""happy?"" Through the book, Guy sees the horrors of his life, and the lives of others. Everyone is oblivious to the torture they are experiencing. Guy wants out but society won't let him go. Guy has books, a fireman has books, books. Now society has turned its back on him, his house is burnt and he is fighting for his life. There are others like him, though, others who contain a forbidden knowledge, the knowledge of a book..."
__label__2	Good Book: What can I say that has not already been said. It is a bit dark and too short, but a great effort none the less.
__label__1	Read it only for school: I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book.
__label__1	it was one of the worst novels i have ever read: it was very boring and i did not lik it at all. it lacked a basic plot and character development. i was very disappointed with the novel and with Bradbury.
__label__1	it was okay: I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving.
__label__1	The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense: This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me.
__label__1	"Profoundly unfulfilling.: Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.""In the future, Firemen burn books"" -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."
__label__2	Classic, for a reason: I picked this up to re-read, hadn't since high school. It is wonderful, easy to see why it has been a favorite for all these years.
__label__2	Absorbing: The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. While there are some changes from the book, the film does stand on it's own.
__label__1	Terrible, Terrible Book!: Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it.
__label__2	Great read: I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.
__label__2	THE BOOK HAD A GOOD CONCEPT BUT I COULDNT GET THE PHRASING: THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE.
__label__2	impressionable: Overall, I liked this book. I am doing my 11th grade AP English-3 research paper on it. Overall, this book made me think. It made me think about how people of the WW 2 time period thought: that there might be another war. This book was an example of only one man's thoughts. It would be interesting to see what other people of this time period have to say about Fahrenheit 451.
__label__2	One of the quickest classic reads around: Bradbury makes it look effortless. The story reads so fast it is as if the author wrote it in one sitting with no revisions. This book is the perfect quick read for those on-the-go folks who have little time for leisure reading. And when you are finished, you will uncover another reason the book is so short.
__label__1	If you are a high school student, this would be a stunner...: If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending.
__label__1	Painful to listen to: Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
__label__1	Dated screed: I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.
__label__1	Boring, boring, boring: I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book.
__label__1	more a name then a real book: this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read.
__label__1	"A bit on the dull side: Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an ""F"" grade. It squeeks two stars."
__label__1	this was horrible: This book is one of the worst I have read!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to read this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple. Only one thing happens in the entire book and that one thing isn't even exciting!
__label__1	"A very disturbing book: I thought this would be a interesting look at the future, and since it's heralded as a great classic, I decided to read it. I'm sorry, but this book is just DISTURBING. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. The plot was confusing, the characters were dull, and the idea is to horrid to contemplate. The ""hero"", Guy Montag, is a strange man in the beginning, and becomes a fugitive murderer later on. Unless you want to see an awful, bleak look into the future, DO NOT READ FAHRENHEIT 451!"
__label__1	Awful: I read this book and i hated it. Don't waste your money on it. It will ruin any respect you have for books. Three words: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!
__label__1	Burn it!: I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped.
__label__2	my review: this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today
__label__1	Hip Hop Uncensored, Vol. 7: Hustle On: i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos
__label__1	A big joke!: This toy is ridiculous! It doesn't do anything. My boys thought you could shoot foam darts, but there is nothing to pull/push on to do that. There are no directions, and this is just a big hunk of plastic junk with a lot of screws that take you nowhere. Doesn't even make sounds.
__label__2	AMAZING!: My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds, many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed. Oh they felt okay, but didn't do the trick. When I went to my brother's house, he sat me down and I sat there the entire night! It was incredible. I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist. This chair may seem expensive, but it's worth every drop. I am waiting for mine to be delivered!
__label__2	Good lessons for anyone: Adolf Von Schell is a combat leader, but his lessons apply to any leadership position. This book is a short read that offers big lessons.
__label__1	Remember: there's no DRANO for the brain-o (beware!): If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse movie, look no further. You've found it.One word: Feh!In NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(2.7) Night Train to Terror (1985) - Richard Moll/Cameron Mitchell/John Phillip Law/Marc Lawrence/Ferdy Mayne/Tony Giorgio/Earl Washington/Gabriel Whitehouse
__label__1	What the heck?: This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase.
__label__1	Mindless!: The plot is God and the Devil bet on who will win, a doctor who rapes his victims before hacking them up with a chainsaw, or a victim who is on the run who can win.
__label__2	Could this really happen?: A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer.
__label__2	Highly Recommended: This CD is a very impressive debut release, I strongly recommend it. Lead singer Delores O'Riordan's vocals are chilling and awe inspiring, and the band has the power and force to impress anyone. This band is also a tremendous live act, check them out!
__label__1	ludwig: Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.
__label__1	"Dark and dreary: A dead girl is found in a field and that leads us to several stories that kind of involve her. Each one is dark and dreary and slow. Toni Collette and Piper Laurie reinact Carrie in the first segment which adds nothing to the film. Actually only the ""Wife"" and the ""Dead Girl"" seem really worth watching and both of those are very dark and again slow and dreary. Lots of good people in this, but no real mystery or suspense. Really just kind of depressing and that's does not make for entertainment. The real world is depressing enough."
__label__2	Must see: I really liked this movie. I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once. Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.
__label__1	"AWFUL!: This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was depressing to watch and the story was very poorly written. All of the ""segments"" were left hanging and never actually came together at the end. There was nothing shocking about the ending, it just ended. I had to double check to be sure that was indeed the credits rolling. What a jip, I want my money back. I foolishly bought this movie without seeing it first thinking it had to be good with all the known actors and the description on the back sounded good. Boy was I wrong! I threw it in the garbage, the first movie I have ever thrown away."
__label__1	Vile, all too Vile, all too stooopid: That's N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this movie.In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims. If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs! Yech!
__label__2	"Disturbingly lovely..: Sometimes, a movie with a (mostly) all-star cast backfires. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. Not so with ""The Dead Girl."" It helps that each of the interwoven plot lines are presented as vignettes, each one poignant and beautiful in it's own way. It really allows the viewer time to get to know the characters. Brittany Murphy was amazing, as was Marcia Gay Harden whose portrayal of the dead girl's mother will stay with you. Great movie. [...]"
__label__2	Very Simple: Spoiler Alert!They found a dead girl in the beginning of the movie. Couple of the people involved were being interviewed in the middle of the movie. They found out who the dead girl was at the end of the movie.That is basically about it. This is very simple. There are alot of sexual contents and naked women in this movie from start to finish. Even old grandma is full frontal naked from top to bottom!! make sure you cover your eyes if you don't want no nightmare. The pace is kinda slow but yet still engaging.Not a bad movie. 4 stars.
__label__1	Poor Quality: Two (2) of the the selections on this disc have static & skip, in fact, the 2nd one just stops after a while. The product is virtually un-usable.
__label__2	where has ramsey lewies been all my musical life?: It's rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. This CD does it. It also gets my 1 year old son shaking his nappy so strong is the rhythm. Familiar songs given a piano jazz working maybe an ignoramus' view but that's what it is. I am amazed this trio weren't hawked to me as part of a back catalogue release sooner. But this proves there are some musical gems yet to be re-released in the noughties. Ramsay, your public needs you - where are you?
__label__2	Amazing CD: If you are into this type of jazz (ala, Gene Harris, Oscar Peterson ) , you gotta love this CD. It is high energy, fun, yet masterfully played. It has an eclectic mix of jazz, blues, and a little funk. There are a couple of live tracks that captures the energy of the audience...and you can imagine how amazing it must have been to see him live. This is going to go down as one of my favorite CDs next to Gene Harris's Concord Years, and Oscar Peterson's Night Train.
__label__2	Finest Hour Indeed!: This is a splendid collection from a great Jazz piano master who is able to cross over into more popular forms without losing the depth and integrity of his inimitable style. Ramsey Lewis and his wonderful trio are national treasures.
__label__2	"Chemists view of Materials: this book is excellently written for the chemists who are getting into materials science. the cross-over can sometimes be tough due to the ""language barrier"" in that materials typically uses different terms for subjects that chemists use. this book, being written specifically to bridge that gap, does an excellent job presenting the material for the chemists viewpoint.the theory is well laid out and examples of computational approaches and discussion of results are clearly presented. the good and bad of methods are presented in an unbiased way allowing the reader to weigh all options in order to select an approach which is appropriate for their research.i highly recommend this book for any upper level undergraduates of graduate student...or any chemist looking to cross over into the world of materials science."
__label__2	Acts- Build Community: Great discussion in our community group. Confronted (mis)conceptions of the Holy Spirit. Deeper than expected from online book review - much growth for all of us.
__label__2	excellent book: good product and good bible study material. learn lots about the work of the holy spirit and how it builds community
__label__2	Good value: This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
__label__1	low quality: the charger did work that is the only positive after one day the top broke off charger and the wires are exposed. I guess you get what you pay for..... low grade merchandise
__label__2	Car charger for Motorola Razor: OEM car charger so it fits well, seems to work well too. No problems with it so far.
__label__1	advertised as OEM??: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.
__label__1	Definitely a FAKE: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to. Bottom line (as always) ***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR***
__label__2	Works great: The charger works great and has a nice design. The cord could be a little longer, so you could use the phone more easily while it's connected to the charger.
__label__2	Razr OEM Car Charger: This product works great and looks good too. This is my second (for my wifes), I have had mine for almost 10 months with no problems.
__label__2	Razer charger: works amazing in my car without any problems. Lights up a bright blue when charging and actually chargers my phone up.
__label__1	"Counterfit item - but works OK: According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated ""M"". It works OK, but should not be represented as made by Motorola."
__label__2	Cheap price good product: My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
__label__2	Excellent Product: This Motorola product is perfect. This cigarette lighter charger is as advertised, priced very low and is everything I expected.
__label__1	Won't Recharge Anything: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.
__label__2	It's Inexpensive and it Works: I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones.
__label__2	Exactly what the family needed.: My family got new phones for Christmas. They all needed cigarette lighter adapters and I wasn't going to pay ALLTEL's prices for an off brand product. I got the real Motorola deal and for just a few dollars.Great product!
__label__2	No worries: I have already used this item several times. It is quick and efficient. I have not had any problems. I am glad I purchased it. I'm not a technically inclined person so it is simple to use. I was pleased with the quality of the product. It was shipped very quickly and arrived at my home within a couple of days. I was impressed with this also.
__label__1	Great Value for the Money: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.
__label__1	disappointed: This product did not last two months. I brought it for emergencies and when I needed it, it wasn't working.
__label__1	DOA: This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for.
__label__1	Motorola Razr V3, V3i, V3c, Slvr L7, L6, L2 Pebl U6, V190, Mpx200, V360, V323, V325 - Ch710 OEM Original Auto Car Charger Syn084: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.
__label__2	Gets the Job Done: Not much to say--it's an inexpensive, effective charger for your car. Particularly useful for the Razr V3m's worthless battery life.
__label__2	the dharma rings twice: The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way.
__label__1	Boring: As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying.
__label__2	Great product: I purchased this for my truck - first class product, easy installation, great looks. It works to keep stuff off front of hood and deflects the occasional bug and rock.
__label__1	Doesn't get to the meat of things: I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals.
__label__2	"Wow! You gotta hear this!: This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
__label__1	A somewhat annoying companion: This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in.
__label__1	More About the Book: BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site.
__label__1	way to make the worst game of all time: Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game...
__label__1	Worst Game Ever: When i bought this game, I thought Wow! I get to play Lord of the Rings! After a week I was bored with it. THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE!!!!!!!!! The combat is very slow and tedious, and the game freezes up to much. Do not under any circumstances buy this game. I gave it one star because it is Lord of the Rings.
__label__1	Horrific: ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
__label__1	Don't believe any hype: First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.
__label__1	Slow, buggy, and awful: I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste.
__label__2	Glitches, Glitches and did I mention Glitches?: Well, the game is ok, as long as you don't want to finish it. Most of the game is just wandering around pointlessly to find things and getting lost a lot. The major problem is that at one point Gimli is invisible when you need to talk to him and the fact that every single game freezes up when you try to leave Moria. Other than that it's well.... ok for being Lord of the Rings merchandise.
__label__1	Beware this game: There's a reason Gamespot gave this game a 2.1 out of 10.This game should never have gotten through Nintendo quality assurance. It's buggy -- you can't even get through Moria without the game freezing. And that doesn't mention all the problems with item cloning, invisible characters, music cutting out, and impossible quests.Even if the game was bugfree, it's awful. Combats take forever (and aren't any fun, since your characters never hit), and the best parts of the book are skipped over, like Weathertop and Amon Hen. Moving your character on screen is like steering a drunk elephant. Seriously.If you're looking for a good Lord of the Rings experience, buy the PS2 Fellowship version (skip the Xbox one), or EA's Two Towers games (either GBA or PS2).
__label__1	This game really sucks: I wish I could give this game negative five stars! Whoever gives this game five stars is a complete loser who doesn't have any good games. This game is not really fun and it has major glitches in it. Why get this game when there are games like Super Mario World, Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2, or a Pokemon game! And I am not biased against Lord of the Rings games or anything like that because I enjoyed playing the Two Towers and Return of the King for the Gamecube. This game is fun for the first 15-30 minutes though. My final words are DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!
__label__1	A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches: This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game.
__label__1	"disappointed: I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
__label__1	Might be okay, but glitches are doozies.: I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it.
__label__2	exiting but...: This game is great! I could not stop playing it even when it was time for bed. I snuck played it under my covers. Only one problem. It takes forever to get through the dwarf chamber. Other than that, it is a great game and I recomend it.
__label__2	Hello!: I am going to try to give you the most spectacular review u have read on this game...During this game u get 2 play as...any member of the fellowship. The cool thing about this game is that it is not divided into levels! You go on and on and on wich allows u to change players at any time! For instacnce...when the cave troll comes u do NOT wanna be pipin! not that u EVER would ,though pipin is cool, but wimpy... the strongest person u can play as is gimli...but its kinda funny watching him waddle around! The fastest person is without a doubt...Legolas! It is kinda frustrating though...how it seems in skimrishes yer pple always miss... but u can fix that by boosting up your players!Heres some info:GRAPHICS 20/20SOUND 20/20FUN 20/20BATTLE 18/20MOVEMENT 20/20OVERALL 98/100This game is sure to please any action/RPG/LOTR fan!!!
__label__2	Very Anticipated!!!: The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring is a very fun and anticipated RPG video game. When I am bored I always play this great game. I can never get tired of a good GameBoy Advance fantasy RPG video game.
__label__1	What a JIP!!!: This is the worst LOTR game ever!!! It takes hours to figure out the damn forest, and a lot of other crap!! My brother bought itoff ebay, and only played it once. The graphics suk, the battle is turn based and slow, and it cost us 30 friken $$!!! Don't listen to the other reviews. This game sux. Buy Return of the King and forget about dis.
__label__1	Pitiful game: This game has so many bugs I'm suprised it works at all. I can't even finish because of a glitch in the Mines of Moria. I wish I could get my money back.
__label__2	Hey give it some credit, listen to me.: So far this game hasn't received any credit, well not much.To start off the graphics are good, and the sound is good too.I haven't seen one glitch yet, I'm sorry. The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon. Fun game for younger kids.GRAPHICS: 8 out of 10SOUND: 6 out of 10GAMEPLAY: 7 out of 10OVERALL: 7 out of 10
__label__1	"Terrible game, very disappointing: I wrote this review only to bring the average rating more in line with reality. I would definitely recommend playing this game before buying it. The story is fine and the graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so [weak]that it will bore your socks off. I used to play way too many hours of MUDs and other text-based adventure games, so I have a high tolerance for bad interface, but this game is potentially the worst I have ever seen. In fact, the game would be much better if they had replicated the character interface from ""rogue/moria"" and put it on the GBA ;)"
__label__1	Please don't buy: This game does not work. All of the other reviews about the game having multiple glitches are spot on. The gameplay itself is mediocre fun, but the fun only lasts as long as the first impassable glitch. I played through thrice, and had to stop every time at a pivotal point that the programmers forgot to actually play test. Because of this one major glitch that happened every time I tried to go through, I was not even able to finish the game.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this title.
__label__1	HORRIFIC: ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS NOT FUN.You'd think that they'd have music and the game does,until you make a move pretty much.Poorly designed,Buggy,You could go on and on about it's flaws. final grade F ...NOT BUY THIS GAME
__label__1	Would have been nice except all the bugs!: This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money.
__label__2	Horrible!: Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!
__label__1	DO NOT BUY: This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Buy a good game like Golden Sun, Wario Land 4, Spyro season of ice, Crash Bandacoot, and Sonic Advance. If you buy it get it for a different gameing platform. Never buy a game after a book or movie for Gameboy Advance I bought Harry Potter for Computer and my friend bought it for Gameboy Advance and I was amazed at how much better the game was for computer. So I highly suggest that you do not buy this game for Gameboy Advance.
__label__1	"Fun for Fans: As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. You can play as any part of the company of the ring, from the first book, "" Fellowship of the Ring"". The game follows the book very well, but the gameplay is a different story. In many areas you get stuck and find that the only way to get out of being stuck is by restarting the game. If you are willing to play, and play to finish the game, then you might find this a good game. The graphic are alright compared to others and you may find that it seems to have a dark tint. If you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this game, if not, i sugjest finding a different game to play"
__label__1	BUGS CANNOT FINISH GAME: Do not buy this game it has bus bugs and more bugs. You cannot finish it. End of story. It gets zero stars. (0)*
__label__1	burned 3 times!: I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was so excited she started playing right away. Shortly after she said there was a glitch. 2 Frodo's would suddenly appear on the screen. I took it back, and since you can only exchange the item for the same item we did. Again the glitches. During battle the players would split and you'd have 2 Frodo's or Aragorn etc.. on screen. We threw it out. Later we found several on a discount rack, Spiro's, race cars and LOTR's. So I figure what the heck, third times the charm right? WRONG. The third one had glitches also. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Especially because it wasn't an all battle game. It has action and puzzle solving too. It just should have had the glitches worked out before it was marketed.
__label__1	"A Bad Video Game: Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."
__label__1	Don't waste your money: This game is based on the movie but is not much like it as far as exciting goes. Don't waste your money on such a buggie game! It would be worth buying the two towers instead. The two towers for GBA starts early in the movie so you won't miss the some of the first seens in the Fellowship. My advice is NOT to buy this game!
__label__1	"The Buggiest Game I've ever seen: Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
__label__1	Too Many Glitches: For those of you who are considering buying this game on gameboy advance, I recommend you change your mind. The graphics are great, but several times when I was playing it, my character would freeze up or get stuck in a corner, and I had to restart the whole game. And in the Mines of Moria, when you finally find the exit, the character freezes and won't move past a certain point. It may work on other consoles, but I'm not sure because I haven't tried it yet.
__label__1	Ok game: This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf.
__label__2	Fun, yet challenging: This game was very fun, but it had some flaws. For instance, when in the Mines of Moria, the game will freeze at a certain point. It was very frustrating, but it is a common problem and can be worked around by going to the customer service website.The game ends suddenly when Boromir tries to take the ring from Frodo. It is very annoying having to wait for the next game before you can continue the quest!Other than that, the game is very fun & challenging. It is especially good for long car trips!
__label__1	AVOID THIS GAME!!!: I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches.
__label__2	"AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!: I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn't it. It's really dissappointing--the story is killed with absolutely NO drama, the music is skimpy and barely playing, and there are almsot no fights. Not that it should be a problem because it's a bare-bones system, with extreme difficulty, slow moving enemies, and confusing mechanics. To make the game even worse, you wander aimlessly through repeating areas to look for an ""item"" that helps you progress through. Although that's not a bad thing for many GBA games such as Castlevania, you'll spend pointless hours searching for an item so you could pass to the next area with the same system. It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action."
__label__1	Was fun until Rivendell.: This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy.
__label__2	There's no glitches!: I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point. You wouldn't want to by a thirty dollar game that lasted two hours. That would [bad]!
__label__1	"Sorry, try again: This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot! If you're looking for a start-to-finish process of how to side a house, as I was, this is NOT it."
__label__1	Not very helpful: I was hoping to find detailed instructions for selecting vinyl siding and installing accessories like soffits, trim, adding insulation, etc. I already know the basics of hanging vinyl siding. I found a lot of the instructions and many of the diagrams confusing. I found the FREE planning guides and installation instructions from the siding manufacturers more helpful. At $14.95 it is not worth the money.
__label__1	"Wrong Title: This book should be titled ""How to Bend Aluminum"". It is poorly written and even worse when it comes to the useless illustrations. It has no business being advertised as a vinyl siding book, and if you should buy it, I'm sure you will find it a waste of your money as did I."
__label__2	A sorely underrated gem of a platformer for Gamecube: Vexx is the type of game that you can not fully appreciate until you get into some of the later levels. I for one think this games' graphics are great, especially through progressive scan. Awesome character designs and very unique textures. Where this game really shines are the awesome, huge worlds you traverse through. I found myself not being able to wait to see what new world i was going to unlock. Each level has 8-10 goals that you can tackle in any order, making it an extremely non-linear game. One area that this game really shines in is the PUZZLE DESIGN! Some of the puzzles in these levels are INGENIOUS! This game is truly for hardcore platforming fans only, if you can't handle your analog stick to perform precise jumping, crawling or maneuvering, you need to stick to your first person shooters.
__label__2	Vexx Rules: I read alot on this game and think it sounds great. I will be buying this if I get good grades on my report card.
__label__2	TONS OF FUN!!!: I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THOSE THAT RATE TOP NOTCH GAMES WITH ONE OR TWO STARS AS SOME HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE=THE GRAPHICS IN THIS GAME IS WORTH THE COST OF THE GAME ALONE=IT IS CLEVER AND TOUGH TO GET TO THE HEARTS AND IF YOU GET BORED PLAYING THIS GAME YOU NEED TO GO GET A LIFE=THIS IS A BREATH-TAKING GAME AND VERY VERY CLEVERLY DONE=TONS OF RE-PLAY VALUE!!!
__label__2	This game trashes other games: OK people, you may think this game sucks, but it doesnt, i have made a lot of research on it and i cant wait till it comes out.It is raw, the levels are so cool theyr huge, the controller is easy to use and this game is an absolute must-have.
__label__1	If you've played mario on N64, you're played this: Basically, if you ever played mario on the N64, you know what this game is going to be like. It's the same type of scenario where you do various things in each level to achieve stars (or hearts in the case of this game). The graphics are cool, but I just became bored due to the dejavue factor. I was dissapointed.
__label__1	I'M OVER IT: With.. Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox, Zelda, & Wario World who's going to have time for this? Please ~Acclaim~ no sequels. Truthfully the first level was so boring I didn't care to go further. I know it reeks that you may have payed ~x~ amount of $'s for this game , but don't beat yourself up. Just brush it off and buy one of the other games I mentioned above. I can only give a few nods for good graphics, sound and idea. Hence the 2 stars.
__label__2	Great overview for those interested in the event industry: I have worked in the event industry for the last three years and decided to read through this book prior to getting into the industry. After gaining more experience and being apart of both small and large events I can honestly say that this book has a ton of applicable information. I highly recommend this book if you plan on entering the event industry, putting on your own event, or just would like to see how much time, effort, and planning goes into events.
__label__2	Expensive, but a great headset...: I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great. I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life.Too bad it's not possible to pickup/hangup without connecting a headset lifter (lame).
__label__2	great quality: For the money this is the best quality sound and options. You can have 5-10 people all in the same office using at the same time with no feedback or echoing.
__label__1	Disappointing: At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300.
__label__2	new headset: the quality of this is very good. only problem is that i wish the battery would last longer. lasts about 4 hours
__label__2	Who says Old Folks don't have fun: I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday
__label__2	"Dear Mad'm: This book is a beautiful biographical story by the person who lived it. The story is wonderfully entertaining from beginning to end. It makes you want more from her continuing to live in the Cal. mountains as an elderly woman with ""young legs"".David Brokaw"
__label__2	Dear Mad'm: I first purchased this book while on a vacation trip exactly 14 years ago (1989); since then I've tried to read it at least once a year. I laugh my way through the book, and the author's courage & zest for life continues to inspire me! I only hope I am able to always view life with the same gusto & joy she had, trials & tribulations notwithstanding. She was quite a remarkable woman.
__label__1	"Book is better than the movie: I really liked the book, that is why I got this DVD. Big mistake. The acting is so bad, it reminds me of those cheesy after school specials where it seems like they just pulled people off the streets and said ""here's the script, do the best you can"". I have several of Mary Higgins Clark's DVDs. It is pretty much hit and miss as to whether or not the acting will be good or not. You're better off renting them."
__label__2	"They Wrote the Book on Transistor Radios: One of the ""must haves"" if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. Hundreds, (thousands?) of listings with photos of some, descriptions of all, and date of manufacture for most. The book also contains estimated value ranges, and useful introductory information."
__label__1	"BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!: What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity."
__label__2	Great for a trip: I bought this movie to my 6 years old daughter see when we are on a trip. But she like so much that everywhere we go she take with her. It's a great movie.
__label__1	The Adoption theme is problematic: Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life.
__label__2	Cheap, and perfect: Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem).
__label__1	Not what was pictured: Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
__label__1	Yellow on Yellow (no black lettering at all): Terribly misleading picture. The Black writing on yellow plastic is exactly what I was looking for, and it is exactly the way most Swanson tools are made. NOT THIS ONE. This is all yellow without a hint of a shadow for contrast. You can still use it for square cuts and such, but don't count on reading the numbers. Get the metal version that is all grey - they are easier to read even with their lack of contrast.I plan to keep the one I ordered and spray paint it black and then quickly wipe the paint off of the flat surfaces in the hopes of getting something like what is pictured. Shame on Amazon for using this picture.
__label__1	Not standard size: This tool does not fit into my American made nail bags.The plastic seems really strong but i will never know cause i cant carry it.
__label__2	"Can't go wrong with Corcoran!: Well made, great tread for walking in snow, sand and standing to work in all day long, I bought these for my partner and he stands at his job all day long and will only wear combat boots. His last pair of combat books were jump boots and the sole did not last. As a former military wife I would never buy anything but a Corcoran boot. The field work boot looks like it will be up to the wear and tear he puts on his footwear plus the soul is thick and has a great tread. We received them in record time to ""boot!"" THANKS! You cannot CANNOT GO WRONG with Corcoran's no matter what cut or style!"
__label__1	Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!
__label__1	Tatum's Worst Hour: The pops and hiss are a horrible distraction. Sounds like a cheap tape recording of a really scratched up record. Buy any other Tatum CD and you'll be much happier.
__label__2	Great work, but...: Art Tatum's playing on this album is truly amazing. It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius. However, the sound quality really turned me off when I was first listening to the record. Its hard to not notice the fuzz, and if I feel that the record deserves a 4.5, nothing lower, which is why I rated it a 5.
__label__2	"Baby oh babys good for my baby!: OK,listen up people! My daughter Lauren bought me this book for mothers day because of its cartoonish cover. But we all know the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" My daughter read it before me (let me mention shes ten and very mature)and liked it but when I read it we both agreed that it sort of overdid the sexual content, but is a good book none the less. It was funny, sad,outragious, and over all a sweet and amusing book. Mostly for adults but mature pre-teens can read it too! Wonderfulfor adults and kids who understand love and the situations in this book. And might I add that Lauren could not put it down for five seconds even if she tried! Same thing with me!Go buy it unless your BORING..."
__label__1	Started out fine, but petered out...: Too much time spent on secondary characters or too much time spent apart by the main characters made this very slow reading for me. I really liked Jake to begin with but I eventually came to not really care. The initial conflict was very strong, but then the author seemed to drift off and care more on Jake's in-law's relationship. The final conflict was resolved too easily for me to really buy into it.But it's not all bad. Ms. Wells writing voice is smooth and easy. I'd be interested to see what she comes up with in the future.
__label__2	Lighthearted and Witty!: Robin does a superb job of bringing an unusual twist to an everyday setting. My mother and I rarely agree on books but this one had us both laughing. I was especially fond of the twinkies, and how the baby mysteriously kept gaining weight. And of course, this review wouldn't be complete if I didn't note my appreciation for the 'pick a peck of poop' sign.Two Thumbs Up!
__label__2	Good, easy read...: This was a cute story, although not too original. Easy read. I would read this author again.Classic feel good love story.
__label__1	"Bad Selection!!!!: Why dont the people who chose songs for Mangione's compilations, instead of just keep putting the same old songs on compilation after compilation, pick some new ones. Perhaps the only reason to buy this album is for ""Floating,"" as it is the only song not yet used for a Chuck Mangione compilation."
__label__2	Worth the Indulgence: The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is the hefty price. This briefcase is terrific and just the ticket for a baseball loving guy who traded in his glove (but not his love for the game) for a desk. It's heirloom quality and I may well come back in 20 years to give it a full five stars if it ages as well as I expect.
__label__1	Nice briefcase, horrible customer service: I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. I contacted the company that shipped the bag, something like 'Sports Accessories', not Rawlings. After 3 months of poor communication (and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle) they informed me that their service department was closing. I asked them to return the broken buckle, but no response. The story is longer than this, but as a result of horrible customer service, I now have a briefcase that i cannot use.
__label__2	Doesn't degrade sound quality: I bought this and a RiteAV 25 ft. 3.5mm Extension Cable at the same time. The RiteAV 25 ft. 3.5mm Extension Cable dramatically compromised the sound quality into my B&W P5 headphones. This headphone extension cable, by contrast, did not cause any drastic deterioration in sound quality. Because of the solenoidal supercoiling, full extension to 25' is difficult, but if you are within say 15' to 20' of your amp, this should not be problematic.
__label__2	great but........: great water housing. but where is the lens cap? i spent $200 on this housing at a store and i am so paranoid about scratching the lens its rediculous.
__label__2	Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers: Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers. It would be helpful, if you want to learn 'matlab' as a mechanical engineer.
__label__2	"Songs 4 Life is 4 kids!!: My kids (kindergarten & first grade) love the Songs 4 Life kids ""Light your World."" The songs are easy to sing along with and the know many of the songs. I found the tempo a little repetitive but I was impressed with the kids' ability to sing along."
__label__2	Great CD but hard to read: My son and I both love the CD and the variations between Japanese songs, bilingual songs that we knew prior, and conversations in Japanese. The book is a bit difficult to read because of the small print of the Japanese kanas, Romanji, and the English Translations in the back. This would be easily remedied with slightly larger print. It is still a great purchase.
__label__1	"Need to know some Japanese before using this product: I found the product inadequate. This CD is a collection of children's songs, with some narrative, spoken by a child in Japanese, preceding each song. The weird thing is the narrative is completely unrelated to the song. Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words ""completely random"".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to ""learn"" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised."

__label__2	"What a blast!: These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded, next to your bed in case the power goes out, toss them in the pool, the tub, the punchbowl,the fun ideas with these things are endless. Incidentally, these work just the same as all the other ""Waterless"" drink coolers that we've had since long before the ""lighted"" ones arrived on the scene. Why-ever would you ""throw them out"" just because the light was done??"
__label__2	"Theme gifts: I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a ""darkened environment."" Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use. Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them. Batteries are not replaceable (unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes). Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery's decay."
__label__1	HORRIBLE!: I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars. I turned all of them on at 10:10p.m. At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and wouldn't turn back on. They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube. They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these. They were cool until they went out.
__label__2	Useful litecubes for different events: I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. (It is such a great gift in festival's sovenuior such as wedding, X'mas or Halloween.) Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests, especially in darkness environment.

__label__2	"Great Argument: This book is a great example of rational thinking. The way Paley states his argument is flawless, and he uses all the resources available by his time. His arguments, of course, are no longer useful to creationists, this book was written way before Darwin and Wallace structure their theory, but at his time this was a must read. Even Darwin and Wallace read the book lots of years later, when they were students, and this book imprint (at least as I'm concern) a great prejudice Darwin had to surpass to establish his theory. It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book ""The blind Watchmaker"" that was inspired by Paley's ""Natural Theology"", and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so). This is a classic book, it is incredibly interesting from a lot of different perspectives, I highly recommend it."
__label__2	"Under rated: Damon Knight was a genius who was largely unapreciated.""Rule golden"" is amazing.As was ""A' is fir anything.Can not praise his brillance enough."
__label__2	Awesome book: I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the development of women in Islam in Africa. The book portrays anthropological and feminist insights to construct a critical ethnography. Furthermore, it explores the difficulties that women in developing countries must face on a daily basis. Other than this, I received the book within of week of my purchase and the book was in excellent condition; I would recomment this seller to anyone.
__label__2	you can't beat Swanson for quality :o): Quality is always first with Swanson, they are perfectly square when you test them. Lightweight enough to be easy to handle, but strong enough to not bend like the cheap ones. Best price and instant ship.
__label__1	Too long to read!: The section on humor is very good, but if you want to improve your presentation skills, it's no point reading a big book, you have to practice to improve.This book could have been more useful if it were more concise.
__label__2	Eight for the Money: If you are a fan of public television, you are going to love this combo! Every title was entertaining, without all the rude sex and violence found in so many of today's box office blockbusters. Delightful and humorous features for only pennies, in your own living room.
__label__2	I Love British Films and The Classics: Why?Because of Colin Firth and Maggie Smith and Judy DenchAlso My daughter in Germany only has her Video Library for entertainment so I send them to her
__label__2	Some great movies: Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these movies. Thought maybe they would be sub pr because there were so many for such a great price. Actually some real gems and some great actors.
__label__2	Britfest!: Great movies, Lots of fun and entertainment with this DVD. It was at our door right after I ordered it. Delivered in very good packaging not a scratch on it. How nice to have so many movies in just two discs. Years of enjoyment ahead with this purchase. I recommend this collection, highly.Indy Jan
__label__1	"Disappointed: What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"
__label__1	Love british movies: But I had already seen some of this movie on Netflix, and did not realize until I had purchased this movie
__label__2	Love this collection: If you enjoy all things English, not to mention Colin Firth, you will love this DVD. Not to mention the other great stories, not headlined by Mr. Firth.
__label__1	The picture quality was AWFUL!!!: Being a collector of period pieces, I have never watched a collection with such aweful picture quality. Do not buy this collection if you want mediocre or good quality viewing.
__label__2	British Cinema Collection: 8 Acclaimed Films: I couldn't believe 8 movied for less than I usually pay for one. Someof my favorite actors wer in these & I thoroughly enjoyed the films.
__label__2	Excellent collection.: I loved all eight films on this DVD. All of the stories were great and the actors did a wonderful job.
__label__1	British Film Collection: We've watched three of the eight and find them hard going. I thought they would be historical but have found the plots to be mundane and predictable. Maybe the others will be better.
__label__1	disapointed: have not seen them all but several so far are trash and the others so-so. would not see them again or recommend them to anyone.
__label__1	No captioning: I was surprised to find that none of the films have English Subtitles or closed captioning, even though when I look at single DVD's of the individual movies, they do have closed captioning. Useless to me.
__label__1	Inconsistent and not Family Friendly: Be aware that while the best known of these is sweet PG rated film and one is listed as Dove approved, others are PG-13 & R rated and filled with nudity and crudity. A disappointment.
__label__2	8-Movie British Classic Files: This was an amazing collection of British films. They were all very well acted and played out. I prefer British film over Hollywood because the actors in British cinema are REAL people. There isn't all that Hollywood glamour!.All in all well played.
__label__1	Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV: Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!
__label__1	DON'T GET THIS!: OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it.
__label__1	Be aware of ATI products: I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI.
__label__1	This Card is fair - service is really bad: Used the card for about 4 weeks and had problems with audio which traced to the bad (...) connector on back..efforts to get service have failed ...This card and its associated software should have been more extensively tested by ATI.
__label__1	"Bad product. Horrible drivers: I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the ""DV"" output of the card had something to do with my problems)."
__label__2	"Fantastic shoes: I think these are possibly the best shoes I own! I don't know how people have such a problem with them. The leather is soft and doesn't rub anywhere at all. I'm so picky about shoes and have no tolerance for ""breaking them in"". These required none of that. I'm on my feet for 7 to 8 hours a day, every day, and wear these almost constantly. Yea, they're not big on arch support, but they're ballet flats, which never have arch support. Relatively speaking, these are pretty good in that department. Cute with pants, jeans, or casual skirts. Perfect shoes - at any price!"
__label__1	Ballet Flat: For it being a Clark Shoe, it had NO arch support. I returned item but had to pay the shipping.
__label__1	Cute but OUCH!: I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability, but I was so disappointed with these! I wore them around the house for a couple of days, hoping I'd be able to break them in, but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet (where the little strap crosses over) was rubbed off and bleeding. I decided to return them. I'll buy Clarks shoes again, but these were not good!
__label__1	Cute but painful: Ugh. I was so excited to get these shoes, but they kill my feet! The band across the top is too tight, and the heels are too loose and rigid. Thre is a definite sizing problem. After one day of wearing them I had raw skin on the top of my foot and my ankles. So painful I went out and bought a different brand of shoes to replace them the next day. Super disappointing!
__label__1	Author Succeeds in Making Erotica Boring.: I'm sure the 'Did you find this review helpful?' patrol will vote me off the island, but this is absolutely the WORST collection of erotica I've ever read... and I've read (er um) lots.Look elsewhere... this one's a snooze.
__label__2	"Behold, one of the original masters!: If one were ahead of the pack and twenty years later the pack had caught up and stomped all over one's then newly demarked turf, is one to blame and to be scorned as cliched by ""today's standards""? Certainly not.The problem is, sometimes it happens. Hassell, Riley, Reich et al are usually in this situation. Now that their studies of non-Western music have been exploited and rampantly overused by anyone from hip-hoppers to electronica artist as well as avant-garders, their legacy is muddled by nay-sayers and not very knowledgeable folks. A shame indeed.Hence, the music of Hassel in Power Spot and Fourth World Music is what the latter day acolytes should be measured against, not viceversa.That said, the music itself is a thrill to experience for the first time (and well beyond). Its use of microtonics, polyrhythms, etc puts to shame many a contemporary ripper-off, setting a standard that still has to be upped. Pure class!"
__label__2	"Today's Standards, Today's Schmanders: Timeless, sublime, beautiful, otherworldly. Forget most of today's derivitive, mixing hip hop, copy cat, [stuff]. This is the real thing. Hassell was there on Terry Riley's original ""In C"" recording that changed music for all time. He's the first trumpeter with a new sound since Miles. He's deep into it, micro rhythms, polyphony, microtones, electronics everything. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE HIM. And this is arguably one of the best. Those who think Eno and his ilk invented alternative music should do a little more research, and find out who the real progenitors are."
__label__2	Death To The Posers: If you like death metal, then this is the C.D and band for you. They currently have 2 c.d's out and if your lucky you can find the original demo tapes floating around. This isn't some cheesy little European death metal band, people of the underground are tuning in to what may soon become the next Dimmu Borgir.
__label__1	SQUEKY SPRINGS: In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
__label__2	From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted: Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel books exist for the country? Because it's quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. In Living Abroad In France, author Terry Link begins with the dream and offers a step-by-step progression to achieving its reality, with chapters surveying all aspects of living in France. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted.
__label__2	Not used yet: These are spares for the wristrocket I bought my daughter so the have not been tested but they seam fine.
__label__2	Progressive in more recent years: Nice Euro mix for a united states tour. For progressive fans this is a must have for the collection.Wish I was there........not sure if the once a year concert is still happening.
__label__1	backpack: Great looking bag. The compartments are the best I have had in a back pack. The support structure is poorly designed which leads to pressure spots on the shoulders and early failure of the seams. Baby it a little (avoid using just one strap with more than a lite load) and it should do ok for the price.
__label__1	Laptop May Fall Out: I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore.
__label__2	"The way singles should be...: All four of the b-sides on this album could've appeared on ""The Man Who."" I actually like a couple of them more than the single ""Writing to Reach You.""""Green Behind the Ears"" is a good pulsating rocker that also makes a good singalong song. ""Only Molly Knows"" (which wasn't a hidden track on my copy of ""The Man Who"") is a brillant acoustic endeavor that follows a unique song structure of repeating the name ""Molly"" twice in each verse. ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"" sounds like a Beatles outtake, with Fran taking on the role of a ""Helter Skelter""-esque Paul McCartney. Another great track. The last track, ""High as a Kite,"" is also exceptional in its call-and-response chorus.Believe me, even if you just own ""The Man Who,"" if you ever come across this single, get it! A great single and four excellent b-sides! What more could you ask for?"

__label__1	Does not work with Windows XP: The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up. Simpletech's web site and tech support are a joke! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages. Save your money.
__label__1	A poor implementation of Plug N' Play: This device should configure a lot easier than it does. I'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware. I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website. Once you get the correct version of the drivers, and install it following the instructions EXACTLY (the device cannot be plugged in while loading the software) it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device. 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002. The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does. I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more, and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types.
__label__2	It is a reader/writer: I had two computers, windows 2000 and windows XP. Windows XP recognized the device immediately, but windows 2000 took me 3 hours to download SP3 to upgrade my system( follow the instruction on the manual). It works on windows 2000, too.The best thing about this product is that it is also a writer. You can use it as an USB drive with your CF/SM card in. I use it to transfer large files between my two computers, instead of a floppy or USB pen drive( which I planned to buy, but not any more).BTW, its speed is USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. Though it is fast enough, it is better if it is USB2.0.
__label__1	Works sometimes: From what I understand of these types of hardware, they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors (e.g. Simpletech) who combine them into the nice products we buy for distribution.Unfortunately SimpleTech doesn't quite get things right. The driver installation for this product went smoothly on Windows XP. It was a matter of clicking the mouse a few times, a reboot, and plugging in the device into a USB slot.However, what followed afterwards and for succeeding attempts at getting the thing to be recognized by your PC would be what I call my own form of digital gambling. Some days the device works when I plug it in, and some days it doesn't. The odds are usually not in my favor.I would have much preferred a more expensive item that worked all the time.
__label__1	Not worth it: This card reader isn't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it.
__label__1	"Snake Oil: The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
__label__1	Beware of bogus reviews...: Like some of them for this piece of [junk]. It's fabulous. It solved all of my problems. Next thing you know these fools will be trying to convince you that it'll eliminate world hunger. I bought one of these and used it maybe 5 times in about 2 months with my smartmedia card. After that it just stopped working. I know it was connected correctly because the drives continued to map to it, but when I inserted either card and tried to access the data on it I was given a message to insert a card. Avoid this product
__label__2	Preformance without PRICE!!!: This is the 2nd flash card reader I have purchased. My operating system is Windows 98se, As you may have read in many areas the problems with USB compatibility.. I had a previous product that left me frustrated BIG TIME!! This is SO PAINLESS. You plug it in and follow the SIMPLE directions. I had this compact flash card reader set up and running with in minutes!!!I have used it for business daily and personal use also. IT IS A GODSEND. I have had ZERO PROBLEMS with this item. And a bonus is it will also read Smart Cards.I was surprised at the affordable price, ease of set up and in this day of HIGH TECH compatability issuse and patches I CAN SAY IT WORKS WELL AND WORTH THE LOW PRICE!!!Happy Pic taking.A Blond
__label__1	Window XP ?????: I Instaled this at home, and it's not compatible with windows XP, it crash my windows system, and in the support page from simple tech there is not a good solution for this problem.
__label__2	Great product!: I have an older digital camera that takes a compactflash card, but the new one I want to get uses smartmedia. What to do? No problem, I got the new camera and this Flashlink reader so I can use both cards and both cameras!
__label__1	"Bad acting 101: It's all been done before but with talented actors. This movie should only be shown in acting school : ""Bad acting 101"". Totaly unconvincing perfomances all around especially by Emily Hampshire, could that mean bad directing? Don't waste time or money."

If you want to win consantraitI have 10 passwords the mondo mountain password is above.The best game ever $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it now worth the $$$$$$$$$$$$ buy it when you can!!!
__label__1	This game SUCKS!: I bought this game and it really sucks! The reason that I bought this game was because I like Rocket Power a lot, and I thought it would be cool to have this game. Once I played it I got bored and wanted to sell it. It doesnt save at all. You have to write passwords down!If you are planning to have this game, you shouldnt! Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played.
__label__2	Heartfelt: Pam, one of the Pony Pals, is shocked to discover that Lightning, her pony, is behaving oddly. He seems upset with her, her friends, and even the other ponies. Pam soon learns the problem is more serious than Lightning's hurt feelings. Readers will be just as anxious as Pam for a happy resolution.This is the first Pony Pals book I have read, and I found it very enjoyable. While its relatively straightforward plot and writing style are clearly aimed at younger readers (well, younger than me, anyway), I still got caught up in the emotion. I was also impressed at the level of complexity shown in the friendship between the Pony Pals. Yes, they're all friends, but that doesn't mean everything is always sweetness and light. I'm surprised to find myself wanting to read other books in the series, and I'm sure regular readers will be pleased by this installment.
__label__2	Pretty Good: In this book, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn't know why. Soon, Lightning starts getting more dangerous and gives Pam a couple more bruises. That's when it's decided to get Pam's dad involved, but what's wrong with Pam's Pony? I liked that at the beginning for once that I didn't have a clue what the problem was. Even though I am getting a little old for this series, I like the fact that these books are well written and deserved to be read.
__label__2	Great Read!: Pam has NO idea what is making Lighting act very strangly. She gets bucked out of the saddle,refuses to eat, and doesn't listen. Will Pam have to give up her pony, or is some seriously wrong with Lighting?? Read to find out!! I LOVE this book VERY,VERY much!!!
__label__2	good !: Didn't realize what games I would be getting with Namco other than ms.pac man, I was hoping there would be mappy lol but game came as expected.
__label__2	WOW!!!: Maybe the best $20 i've spent in my life. I love retro arcade games, and game i found sitting in the kohl's department store and i immediatley bought it. The graphics are low (duh) but it is still great. There are so many good games; my favorite is Galaga Arrangement, a new version of Galaga with better graphics and more power-ups. BUY IT!!!
__label__2	The video games we used to play as kids....: My 9 year old son received a GameCube for Christmas and the 2 games he received were WaveRunner and Luigi's Mansion. Both of those games he liked, however I have motion sickness bad and cannot play alot of the games they have out now because of all the movement. I specifically bought this Namco Museum for me and guess what everybody loves it! It is great to be able to show my son some of the older games we used to play as kids. I just wish it had Centipede on it..That would be great. Enjoy all you Pacman and Galaga fans....
__label__1	12 games for 9 bucks: Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong
__label__1	This reference book is terrible!: I wish I had bought the Roget's International version. There are so few synonyms in this thesaurus--and if I want definitions, I'll use the dictionary. Synonyms: worthless, useless, stink-o
__label__1	"I don't know about this edition, but 1st was crap. Try...: Buy ""The Synonym Finder"" if you want a REALLY good thesaurus. I am only familiar with the first edition of ""Roget's II,"" but I consider that edition to be among the worst volumes in print."
__label__1	Terrible choices; Not thorough enough.: I do NOT recommend this reference book. It has very little synonyms and merely takes up shelf space.
__label__1	"Do you have no family or job?: There may be rewards here for people who are intelligent enough and have the time to spend, but that's not me. I've always felt ""smart."" (800, 800 and 730 on the GRE's-degrees in mathematics) but this book made me feel like a mental midget. Either Joyce had an I.Q. of about 775 or there is nothing here to understand. I don't have time to find out. At least we got the word, ""quark,"" from this book."
__label__2	try: get some help and give it a chance. skeleton's key is good and if you can get the tapes then you're half way there.
__label__1	Will be forgotten: FW will soon be forgotten because soon (a century?) no one will be able to understand it. As it is, only a few thousand people in the entire world bother with it now because it is too difficult and arduous to read. Reading FW is more like a language project than a pleasant reading experience. Some people like to work out mathematical theorems. Some may like working out FW. I do not. With each year, because of the way language changes, FW will become more and more incomprehensible so that there will eventually be more people around who read and understand Old Norse than this novel. Joyce, who loved languages, should have known that. As it is, he wrote a novel with its own built in destruction. He consigned it to what is a certain and inevitably obscure death.
__label__1	"Finnegans Wake Me Up: One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they've read the book cover to cover but actually haven't read more than a little; or (2) if they have read it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands.One thing it is not (contrary to what some pretentious reviewers here would have you believe) is a ""fun read"" or ""page turner"".Despite some glittering word play and demonstrations of great scholarship, Finnegan's wake is a hulking mess."
__label__2	Finnegans Wake: Not Just a Book, and Experience: I'm 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best book I've ever read. I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine. GET THIS BOOK NOW!
__label__1	"James' Joys is Dead!: With this lit tall reave view I rue in all love Joyce is ""Fink Against Wake."" Poor Read errs, why do use still read that mess?! Be cause it is litterassure! Aye con cur! Joyce sad little skill lend less art. I ownly at hack him be cause tomb many read errs prays him. He is dead end gone. I am all I've! Your hear owes dead! Go back kenned lessen to what he rote. Then calm back hear end read this say gain. Come pair. There is no con test."
__label__1	"Gibberish!: ""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."
__label__1	Ridiculously Bad: I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about.
__label__2	Greatest book ever written: Unbelievably complex book; possibly the last book you ever have to read & understand. Take 3 years to work on this masterpiece. A good grasp of Celtic and British history essential to its full appreciation. The story of creation, the theory of cultural evolution of civilization, the history & mythology of the Celtic people...what more could you possibly want?
__label__1	Please email me tell me why this is not drivel: My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake.For years, I have asked English Lit experts what is the genius of Finnegans Wake. No one could give me a straightThe Emperor has no clothes. No one knows why this is great, save for some so called experts who extol this book.I beg of anyone out there, please email me tell me why this is not drivel. You can reach me at alkruse@gmail.com
__label__1	If you are one of the 7 people who understand this book, please let me know: If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating.
__label__1	Who's Laughing?: This is an ongoing hoax perpetrated, sustained and constantly embellished by a Literary Establishment who simply wish to award each other doctoral degrees in pretending to understand this mishmash of a book. It may very well be the worst thing ever published. It is certainly the worst thing ever published with college courses based around it.
__label__1	An Udder Disaster: The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience.
__label__1	Huh?: Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the book for people who didn't find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Don't even bother trying to read this.
__label__1	Finnegan's Wake: Stream-of-conscious blather that only a psuedo-intellectual could appreciate. I can't imagine being the person who had to proof-read this drivel, I would sooner plunge my hand into a vat of boiling oil. If it were possible I would give this book zero stars. You'd be better off spending your money on some LSD and interpreting the meaning of the waves in your fingerprints.
__label__2	"Laughter: What helped me understand this monument of literature a bit better was the anecdote I read in Nora Joyce's biography ""Nora"", where she complained that she couldn't sleep at nights when Joyce was writing FW in his working room, laughing at his own scribings.Finnegans Wake is one of the most hilarious/beautiful books I've read. In fact I could replace the ""hilarious/beautiful"" with just about any other adjective, and it would explain as much."
__label__2	"Cross-world: O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
__label__1	NOOOOOO: NO! BOOK BAD BOOK BAD BIG BIG WORDS I DONT UNDERSTAND! MY BRAIN HURTSSSS! THIS MAKE NO SENCE. YAHOO CHAT MUCH EAZYIER TO UNDeRSTAND! I GO THERE NOW.
__label__2	overjoyced!: What a zen master would state in a 3-line Haiku poem, Joyce says in a 700-page book, with ever dancing, ever-changing words in an amazing, multi-levelled labyrinth, more suitable and charming to Western intellect than Oriental thought. Definitely NOT the first Joyce book to read. Life is a wake, live it or krikkit!
__label__1	Exactly what's wrong with Literary Scholars: This book is long. Long and pointless. Sure, it's fun to sit down and make up words, or compose stream-of-consciousness relayings of dreams we've had, but why would anyone want to read them?And, anyway, any book with a quote on the back from Harold Bloom is not worth MY time, at the very least. That man is a menace, and so is James Joyce. Thinkers thinking about thinking. Not real people, not real thoughts, no significance, no soul. Pointless, long, and forgettable.
__label__1	Whoa, dude!: My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!
__label__1	word salad as verbal Rorschach test: let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate.
__label__1	this is bad: This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world. This book has no value except to make you laugh at how far some people would go to pretend that it could be interpreted. There are better wastes of ones time, for example staring at a blank wall.
__label__1	One of the most unreadable books ever!: Which should be the only reason one would have this book in a collection.Daferring on red hair moots the ramdelgerag! Cays hast ner eyed the entire lash from the libre, does get sidlelassinlunahack? And for ery' scholar of jits and wallyfins, dare may cieved a consciousable readament of peering quenth Labrynth. Hark! Vain! Rack! Finnegans Wake dost injoyafun for the kathweolasopkookoo. One glance may planner read and ner open this Rhodical magnumus.If you understood what I just wrote then you may just enjoy this book.
__label__1	"WTF is this?!: Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
__label__1	Contemptious: The pretence here is to say that if you don't think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Its the same stunt as pulled by 'modern-art', whose lack of popularity and understanding among most people lends it a perverse exclusivity among irrational psuedo-intellectuals.No one 'understands' this book because there is nothing in it. Its not hard-going because it is so mentally challenging, its hard going because it is so uttlerly uninspiring. A dime pulp romance novel tells us more than this book can.If someone crafted your house with the same 'wondrous perception' as Joyce crafted this book, it would be rubble sunk in cement dust.
__label__2	Iteration: FW is not a piece of literature. It is beyond literature: It approaches life and non-life. Is life easily analyzed and coherent? Is non-life? Joyce recognized the dichotomy and tried to capture the incapturable in words. He taunts the reader with meaning and the critic with nonsense. Ultimately, both the divergencies converge and vice versa. Take a look at the Mandelbrot fractal: Numbers approach nil and infinity giving alluring patterns in a mimicry of life and non-life. Joyce creates the already-created, concurrently destroying the already-destroyed.A long the...Joyce presents the question - forbidden fruitriverrun,Joyce slithers toward us - temptationpast Eve and Adam'sJoyce plunges the reader into chaos - banishmentWe find ourselves ensnared in a recirculation, striving once again for order, until we realize that we must step back in order to find Truth.I haven't even read the book, but does it really matter???
__label__1	Evelyn Waugh: Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page. That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from.
__label__1	"Don't bother: Imagine John Lennon's nonsense lyrics for ""I am a walrus"" going on for hundreds of pages. I think maybe a hundred or so people in the entire world might enjoy digging through this but the rest of us can put this one aside. Don't fall for that snobby ""Well, it's not for lazy or stupid people"" nonsense. This is nothing more than a self absorbed word puzzle for those who do not have lives to live but have plenty of time to waste deciphering this. Maybe, one day, if I am ever in a crippling accident and am confined to a wheelchair with little to do but figure this one out, I might attempt reading through it again. Everyone else, stay away!!"
__label__1	"I'm Baffled: I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's ""genius"" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."
__label__2	In Defense: this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us.
__label__1	"Understanding ""Switters"": In Tom Robbins ""Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates"" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages. I now understand why."
__label__1	"The Story of Humanity?: The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity? How is my understanding of, or sympathy toward, humanity improved by attempting to read and decode the word ""Bababadalgharaghtakamminnarronkonnbronntonneronntuon- thunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoordenenthurnuk""? There are many far greater works that not only tell the same story, but are readable and even enjoyable. My apologies to those who like Finnegan's Wake, but humanity is not best served by having its story told in gibberish."
__label__2	The only book you'll ever need.: This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people.
__label__1	"Do Not Buy This Version!: This version of ""Finnegans Wake"" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting ""Finnegans Wake"", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."
__label__1	Less than impressed. Weak compared to his other works.: While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author.
__label__1	Houston...we have a problem: I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world.
__label__1	"Yikes!: I can't understand why anyone would spend 20 years writing thisThe book is incomprehensible. Read a regular book you can understand without having to read it aloudI love Joyce. Portrait, Dubliners, great stuff. Wonderful poetry. He starts to get a bit wonky in Ulysses, but even that is readable (if not altogether understandable - Giffords book is definitely a necessary provision)But why write a book such as the Wake? Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess. How was this even published? Didn't someone tap him on the shoulder and say, ""Joyce, this makes no sense""Good grief! Joyce was actually a decent writer to this point!"
__label__1	"The Emperor Has No Clothes: FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."
__label__1	Fails As Literature: Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page. If you hate it, you'll hate the rest. If you love it, you'll love the rest. The quality of the writing stays fairly consistent.
__label__1	Finnegans Wake: Well, what can I say? This kind of writing would never make it past Mrs. Johnson, my 7th grade English and Grammar school teacher. I made many attempts at reading this gibberish. To those who like this book, kudos's to you few. I highly recommend this book as an anchor on night stands of insomniacs everywhere. I join the ranks of those who do not like this book. I'm sure there is something enriching in there, somewhere. Who was the editor? I know it was not Mrs. Johnson!Jimmy Lair
__label__1	Kind of light and fluffy.: This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this. Reading this book will take about and hour and a half, though it will only feel like 20 minutes. Think Curious George. I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence).
__label__1	I do not like Finnegans Wake: I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion. Ulysses and A Portrait managed to be both timelessly powerful and legible; it's a pity Joyce didn't make better use of his seventeen years.
__label__2	This was a present for my husband: My husband said that they shoe is very comfortable and he would buy them again. I thought the price was very reasonable
__label__2	Nursing as a Ministry: Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve.
__label__2	Question of thought: How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi's philosophicaland ethical system of thought?
__label__2	Genius: If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it. His wit, enthusiasm, courage, and extreme energy will keep you enthralled in his arguments. These are the two works by Nietzsche that give him his reputation as an extremist and genius.
__label__1	defective, very disappointed: This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. The inside of each clear plastic pocket was covered with an extra layer of cheap, tear-able, thin plastic. Several places it was torn, creating a messy obstructed view for any pictures or words I would put in the plastic pockets. This made the product unusable.
__label__2	I am pleased: Receiving this product was right on time. My opinion of the book was very informational for me.
__label__2	Excellent insight: As a long-time Christian, I had to admit that my disciplines were somewhat haphazard. This book is not advocating legalism but encourages discipline while offering insight as to why it is important in order to live a rewarding God-pleasing Christian life. Put into practice, it will cause you to constructively strengthen your Christian walk.
__label__2	This book has been a great influence in changing my life!: This book has been the book with the most impact on me outside of the Word of God. It has practical steps and illustrations on how to acheive a close and intimate walk with God. It plainly explains that having a close walk with God is not something mystical, but is something everyone should and can experience.
__label__2	a good overview of the Christian walk: I was required to read this book for a seminary class. Many people found the book to be amazing, and felt that it really strengthened them. I enjoyed the book, but wouldn't list it as a favorite. However, if you're looking for insight into how to grow, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.
__label__1	Signs of the times: Deceivers will rise up from among you and deceive many.This book is just a copycat of many books before it from Richard Foster,etal. This list of so-called Disciplines is straight from Richard Foster's Spiritual Formation curriculum, in which the occultist centering prayer method is taught. It is occultist to the core, but dressed up nicely as Christian.
__label__2	Our bible study is using: We are about half way through and a majority of members have expressed they like the book. We are using this in conjunction with the study guide. We choose a few key study guide questions to discuss each week.The content is great, the use of scripture to support is pretty good, and the message is clear and pertinent.
__label__2	Solid.: This book is a solid read and works well as a go-to-guide to spiritual disicplines. The section on journaling is dated, but perhaps you could draw a correltation to bloggin. Either way, it is worth a read.
__label__1	"The Other Side Of A Christian Classic: Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
__label__1	Disappointing . . .: I had read 5 or more rave reviews about this book and was excited to receive it. After reading it, I am sorry to say that it was not life changing, inspiring or even a good read. The book seems so childish to me. Maybe because I am 50 and the author is 29. Maybe the lessons she is trying to pass on I have learned a long time ago. Things like it's not O.K. to tease or take advantage of another person. . . Just disappointing. Maybe it is a good read for someone who hasn't done a great deal of living yet.
__label__1	Not sure about veracity of the material: The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society.
__label__1	Misleading: If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting.
__label__1	Copyright BEFORE reading...: Single in Saudi is a complete work of FICTION! It says so in the copyright. I have made that mistake before so now I always check to see if it is fictional or is a true event or sadly ...true EVENTS! If you like autobiographical books or biographical as I do, always look for the copyright. Also, get the sample first. If you do not like fiction then you need not pay for it!!
__label__2	Good Value, blew my GeForce 2 away: I love this card. It is a great value and supported DirectX 8.0 very well. It is a good value at only $.. compared to at least $... for a GeForce 4. The DDR memory really makes a difference over the SD in the GeForce. I replaced a GeForce 2 32mb with this card and did not have any problems installing it. My Pentium 4 with 394mb RDRAM and this card run Operation Flashpoint and Battlefield 1942 really well. A+
__label__1	"Dual Moniter support doesn't work with 2 CRT's: I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
__label__2	Good Product: I did't buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch movies that I had on my computer. The quality was not that bad and setup was fairly easy. Just follow the directions and your set. This card comes with an s-video output so it doesnt look that bad when it goes on tv. The price is pretty good and it does its job. The only expensive thing was when i had to get long audio and s-video cables.
__label__1	an awful card: Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. Has many cool features, TV-out,dual moniter etc.Bad parts: my computer is 5 years old with a really crummy vid card, and i play a lot of online games with it. They usually run 20 or 30 frames per second, which is barable but i could do better. so i went to comp usa and the guy told me to get this one because it was plenty fast. I installed evrything properly but even after tweaking and adjusting to the max all i could get was 12 fps. This card was so useless i exchanged it for a PNY technologys Verto geforce 4 ti 4400 card, which rocks btw....rocks hard.
__label__1	DON'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE: I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card. I tried all the right way of trying to cancell it, but it looks like Amazon can get a card ready for shipping within minutes of a purchase, but the delivery date is August 15. I have written you an email, now how long will it take to get a response with Amazon.
__label__1	Doesn't block the heat much, flimsy mouse pad: Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops.
__label__2	Great Product: Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow.
__label__2	We like them: I purchased two Lapinator's plus, and two Mousitizer's for my wife and I. These were shipped to New Zealand and arrived within a week.We both have Alienware 15.4' laptops that are quite heavy and get a little warm :) (hot). I am always in shorts and we have both found them excellent.We like the way it protects our legs from the heat and the soft padding on the underside of them. Also we like that they are strong and can easily take the weight of our laptop's when we move then from our lap to a table etc.As to the 'mousitizer' we think they should be wider, that is from front to back, not wider, as out from the Lapinator. We both find/found that the mouse was a bit to far away for comfortable use. But as a add on to the Lapinator, it works well.
__label__1	"Much, MUCH better available... I suggest you keep looking: I am not at all pleased with ""the Lapinator"" product. It is not rigid at all, the flimsy plastic top distorts from laptop heat, and it's not wide enough (and I have the larger one).[...] They are not terribly durable, lasting only about a year before suffering stress cracks, but they are great while they last!"
__label__2	Love this, easy to use and makes working from the couch awesome!: This is so easy to use and keeps your laptop from overheating.I used this while I was laid up from knee surgery and it was great to be able to keep my leg up while continuing to work from home. Love it!
__label__2	"It Works Great!: It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12"" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"
__label__2	"Got a Laptop? You'll need the Lapinator/Mousitizer: I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. If I had paid attention to her use of the Lapinator with Mousitizer, I would have gotten one a long time ago. The lap table has space for my 17"" laptop and a clip-on USB LED light. The Mousitizer is what makes this combo work so well. The table itself insulates from the heat, and the Mousitizer fits snuggly to the table. I think the optional rubber bumper border is a must to block your wireless mouse from falling off at the slightest tilt of the table. I tried another laptop table brand that folds for travel, but at home I don't use anything but the Lapinator."
__label__1	Laminator Plus: I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off.
__label__2	Was Everything I was looking for: I ordered this strictly as a keyboard and mouse holder for my family room computer. I wanted to be able to game and browse comfortably from my couch. This works Perfectly. Allows my keyboard and mouse to stay securely in place even while moving. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a similar solution.
__label__2	Great: I bought the lapinator and Mousitizer after a lot of searching (and a few failed home builds) so I could comfortably watch movies, play games etc on my bed in Iraq. I wasn't expecting much but when the Lapinator finally arrived it became a must have for several people in my living area. It was light weight and the non-skid feet would allow you to prop the computer up a little without worrying about it falling over. Even after a marathon session of gaming on an off day my legs we're hot from the laptop and the feet allow a good bit of air flow to go under the computer so even my computer was cooler than expected.! My only complaint is the mouse part is rather flimsy and putting a lot of pressure can cause it to fall off and just using it causes it to slant downward.4/5
__label__2	Awesome Knife: This knife was everything i expected and more. This is one of the greatest all around knives i have ever seen. It is super strong, has a great wieght and balance, and of course it keeps a great edge... it is a benchmade. I highly recommend this knife to any outdoorsman, hunter, even our beloved soldiers in all of our armed forces. This knife will withstand most anything, and stay sharp with just a little TLC.
__label__2	The BEST Book I've ever written -- JOHN JB WILSON.: I hope you have as much fun reading this humorous collection of film cliche's as I had writing it and collecting the movie stills which illustrate it. I know I wrote it, but I still laugh out loud at my favorite entries every time I pick it up. WHY NOT PICK UP A COPY YOURSELF
__label__1	"Only posers & jocks enjoy this crap: I dont see how any one into real brutal music (deathmetal) can enjoy such crap specialy because all the songs here sound exectly like the previous...Why kids call repetition brutality? I dont understand that and never will because? Honestly? I hate hardcore music because only winps and jocks enjoy this garbage. Hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" has nothing good or great about it and all you straight edge fa*gots need to hang yourselfes... I quess im too old for this new generation so i rather listing to my morbid angel or death or possessed collection insted of this and you realy want to listing to actual brutal music? Listing to cryptopsy,disgore, severe torture, dyingfetus, necrophagist, and, devourment. Skip this trash."
__label__1	Dont buy this!: I like alot of music but this I dont.I dont even think this should be called music.Every song sound the same.This cd is plain horribal.Dont buy it unless your on the highschool football team so you can fit in with the other jocks.
__label__2	high quality: I'll keep this short, since you don't need much explaination. This album slams harder than just about any other. You'll listen to it all the way through at max volume. It will absolutly blow your mind. If it doesn't, check your pulse....
__label__2	if you're angry, get it now !: This album is the very definition of metalcore.Very heavy songs, filled with anger and pain.I give it 4 stars because I think some lyrics could 've been improved, and some songs sound the same, But It's suerely a good album. Worlds apart is my favourite song.
__label__2	Extremely Intense: I've heard a lot of very hard bands in my day, but few are able to produce the raw emotion and sound of Hatebreed. If you are looking for an album to get pumped up to, whether it be working out or preparing for a sporting event, this is one to add to your collection. The album's only faults are its short length and some of the songs sound too much alike.
__label__2	"This is a very good hardcore band/CD: Hatebreed isn't a modern ""sell-out"" wannabe hardcore band. These guys are alsome and i suggest them to any hc fan..."
__label__1	"Hatebreed is kind of awful: Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."
__label__1	Worst band EVER!: nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. .
__label__2	Except for drums, awsome: Hatebreed (CONNECTICUT HARDCORE!!!!!) is amazing except for the less that spectacular drumming. Hatebreed now has a new drummer however (Woohoo!), so they're now unstopable.
__label__2	For the General Audience: This doesn't mean its bad, its simply mainstream. I mean, they dont bother tagging those on unless it is a widely known band. Hatebreed are not fanpleasers, great live, and have strangely undertstandable vox on this album. They've got the emotion many bands with the same formula lack, and thats what set them apart from others. They've got the feeling of hxc and the temps of mxc. It's not so much a blend of the two, but their own interpretation of both. This is beyond mediocre, but its not going to blow you away. They have more talent but this is the sound they like and their slight maturing of their sound is what keeps them going strong. This is what people see as a defining album, but its nothing of the sort, it simply excels at what its set out for. Breakdowns designed for the mosh it seems, if you get into it.
__label__2	"Good metal.: They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song ""Last Breath"". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under ""Metalcore"". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official ""head banging, mosh pit"" band of today, and this album definitely shows it. It even comes with a poetic title."
__label__2	"lovely: Many times i have seen this album cover and told myself "" they look like a ""bad"" punk band"" boy was i wrong ?Yes, very darn wrong ! The reason i used to think they were a punk band it's cause i had never seen them any where and i actullie support every local,underground, and ,upcoming band there is... Weather its grincore,blackmetal,thrash,death,metalcore,hardcore,emocore and,punkrock and i never heard about hatebreed ? but upon buying hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" i found myself to be very happy and proud at the fact that i own something that sounds agressive and intense as hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" not only is this disc worth own it but also here you have great, great political subjects! As for a fav song ? mmm i'll go with ""last breath"" those riffs are just fantastic !! Peace son !"

__label__2	essential: Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A true masterpiece of Reggae.
__label__1	"A Disservice to Martial: This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."
__label__1	Disappointed: The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can't close your hand when it is on. Returning the item was even more difficult. While I returned it within one week of purchase, it took 7 weeks and a complaint filed with Amazon to get my refund. If you do purchase from this seller & ultimately have to return something be very sure you get a tracking number or receipt confirmation. Without that I would still be waiting for my money.
__label__2	BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!!!!!!!: This book has the most beautiful pictures in a book that I've seen!!!!!! I do not know how someone could be so talented to be able to draw those kinds of pictures!
__label__2	Amazing Resource: This non-fiction book is used every year in my 4th grade class. It is a great addition to the Iditarod unit that I teach! It's loaded with artistic drawings and anecdotes. The kids love it! Highly recommend.
__label__2	von Igelfeld for the win!: I think this may be McCall Smith's funniest work, and strangely his most endearing. His affection for his characters - three very thin, very tall, very overeducated linguists - is obvious in every paragraph. The humor that ensues from Professor Doctor Doctor von Igelfeld's adventures and misadventures is honest and endearing, while gently reminding us not to take ourselves quite so seriously.
__label__1	Relaxing entertainment: I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
__label__2	good old fashion storey: great to see jean claude in a non-martial arts movie, not a oscar winner by any mean, but a good storey , up dated by modern advances in photography, see it, and see history, the way it was..
__label__2	"this movie is far UNDERrated: I'd never even heard of ""Legionaire"" until a skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" (where Kris Kattan portrayed VanDamme) made fun of the fact that nobody saw this movie. I of course thought that this movie must be godawful, so I rented it just to be entertained by its horribleness. But I was amazed at what a great movie this was! It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good. I'm surprised that a decent movie like this goes straight to video while other movies which are far more lame and stupid make it to the big screen. If you rent it you won't be disappointed, especially if you have low expectations to begin with"
__label__2	"one of ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"" ...: Was that even a Van Damme film ? ... oh well , that's how I would discribe this Van Damme film .Great sets , Great locations , Great costumes , Great props , ok acting ... this is Van damme after all !The only 2 things I could complain about is the fact that Van Damme was a little bit cheesy about being proud to be a LEGIONAIRE and the ending ( I wont spoil it) .... it just seemed prodictable to me .All in all , this is a good film and I recommend this as one of the best Van Damme films ."
__label__1	van damn this was terible: This would be the worst van dam movie I ever seen not a good plot. I am used to so much more from van dam that this movie was disappointing
__label__1	Good action shots but a pitiful storyline that yawns: 2.5 Stars because the action scenes are great, but the plot is simplistic and the semblance at drama pathetic, with irritating stabs of shallow sentimentalism and worn cliche. Worth renting but not worth buying unless you want good action shots and are a Van Damme fanatic. I will sell my DVD if I can. A previous review compares this to Glory, but I consider the comparison far-fetched, unless action is the sole criteria.
__label__1	LegionnAire: LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Van Damme should stick with doing Katate movies not acting movies
__label__1	"Legionnaire: This movie is the worst Van Damme movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I found myself drifting in and out of deep sleeps while I was watching this boring film. Please, do not waste your time or money in renting or buying this movie. It has only one ""Van Damme"" style fight scene throughout the whole movie. Not his best, his worst."
__label__1	"A GREAT IDEA WASTED: VAn Damme's movies were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one ... Then a good idea came up: why don't try to make a kind of ""epic"" movie, taking a lengendary theme (the French unit called ""Foreigner Legion"" )and changing from the custumary scenario of karate kicks and sterotyphed villains who want to rule the world ? Great idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will never improve as an actor... EVery frame of the movie is wasted, making us think that he is being bad orientated by his agents or film-producers. IT's a totally unconving history, without pace and rhythm..."
__label__1	definitly van Damme's worst!: this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! And definitly van Damme worst ever!The only reason I normally watch his films for is his fighting ability...but there's like no fighting in this one...and the rest of the action is nothing special....and this isn't even the worst part of the movie....the worst is the sotry it has to it......very pathetic altogether...skip this one!
__label__2	Good Movie, worth watching: This movie was good, because it show's that Van Damme doesn't have to kick the crap out of people to star in a movie. It has a good story to it and some emotional scenes that show Van Damme's true acting abilities. Definitly worth renting.
__label__2	Very Good Movie: This is a very good Van Damme movie. It is not his best movie. But I would have to say it was his best acting. Great action scenes.
__label__2	A moving and touching film, with plenty of action: Van Damme scores big in this movie. Finally he has picked a movie with a decent supporting cast and a good story. Unlike previous films, Van Damme's kickboxing and martial arts skills are blended nicely with real life situations and drama. This movie deserved a theatrical release, the action is tasteful and the movie has a quick but meaningful pace. Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles. Lionheart has the same tug on the heart strings, as well as the Legionaire angle.
__label__2	Good,but its not like his other movies: I went the store and i saw this movie on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the movie was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne.This is like the only movie i didnt see him do his fancy kicks.This movie is worth watching,but if u wanna see his kicks dont get this one.
__label__1	Boring Van Damme Movie: Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood.
__label__1	The movie is a mute to 21 million hard of hearing people.: There is no close caption to the movie, and it is very boring, due to not understanding what is going on without close caption. Remeber there are 21 million deaf and/or hard of hearing people in U.S.A. that depends on close caption. If ypu cut our close caption off, then the rating falls way down.
__label__1	did not like it: I purchased this book after I read the good reviews. I really did not like it. The story was dull, the heroine uninteresting and the hero not a hero at all (but just some idiot).
__label__2	Great fit for 70# lab mix: I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption.
__label__1	could not get my dog to wear it: i tried everything but he hated it. it was a no go. even though i set it to a snug fit, he kept pawing at it until he was finally able to get it into his mouth and chew on it.
__label__1	No: These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn't able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Not a good idea.
__label__2	Pulling is Over: A must for a determined puller, not for the dog but us owners! Near instantaneous better walking. Buddy still needs it after about three weeks. I thought he would get the idea and then I could stop using it. Not true yet and maybe never, which will not be so bad. A little bit of a pain to put on when he wants to go for a walk. Also, he has already chewed the plastic clasp and I had to buy another. His bad allowed by my not making sure it was up and away while we were out. Buddy is a puppy that requires training. Holt is a well thought out product that is effective. I recommend it.
__label__2	Sizing is a little off: I agree with the other reviewer about the sizing. 0 is supposed to be for a doxie size, but my Jack Russell/Pug (20lbs) mix can slip out of it when it's not set super tight. We have a min-pin mix, about 11lbs, and I worry if we order another 0 it will be too big. Honestly 0 should fit the smallest dog, not a 25 pounder! Still a good product despite the sizing issues and the cost is good compared to other's.
__label__2	Good tool to help with pulling: Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!
__label__1	All Chewed Up: My dog also chewed one of the straps, and the halti is now useless. Be aware that you have to closely watch your dog when you use the halti to make sure he is not chewing it. I was very surprised to find the halti ruined when I took it off of my dog because I was less than 3 feet away the entire time he wore it.
__label__1	Disappointing: At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money.
__label__2	works: really work as they said it would instant control. nice walking a dog that doesn't pull you off your feet the moment you go out the door. longer walks more at ease
__label__1	"It's a fake: The collar actually works fine but it's not a Halti. It's a 'Holt"" Looks and works the same but it's not a Halti which is what I was ordering."
__label__1	Doesn't work with either of my dogs....: We have two Bernese Mountain dogs. Niether will use this collar. They fight to get it off the entire time. Tugging on it does not get their attention. PetCo also expects you to just mail items back with no documentation. Return for this is not handled by Amazon...
__label__2	Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix: What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. This training collar distracts her from pulling because it is positioned under her mouth. She did not like it initially and tried to take it off, but then she concentrated on the walk itself.Another nice feature of this collar is that it is adjustable in the front under her nose, so if it is hot outside and the dog has to pant she can open her mouth.The collar is supposed to attach to a regular collar that the dog wears all the time, although I used it as a single collar on my dog.
__label__1	Broke on second use: I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
__label__2	Works well: This Halti collar worked well at controlling my Great Dane. He learned not to pull very quickly.
__label__1	Didnt last long: The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that.
__label__1	"Not a Halti: Ordered a Halti training collar and received, on time, a Holt collar. Called seller, not respones. ""Returns require prior authorization code,"" but request was routed to a ""mailbox full"" number. No follow up from seller."
__label__1	Sizing instructions are off: The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
__label__2	halti: I have a 100 lb lab- australian shepherd mix. When we are out walking he tends to forget that I exist whenever he sees a new dog, and he is strong enough to pull me over. I have tried several different approaches, including a choke chain, without a lot of success.The halti has worked better than anything else I have tried. He has been able to remove it a couple of times, but since it ended up around his neck, he was not able to get away from me.
__label__2	Takes some getting used to: I purchase this head collar on advice from a friend. I have been using it for my great dane mix who is a puller. She didn't like the collar at first, but I am sticking with it and she is adjusting. It is well made and working out great. It also comes with some training tips that are helpful. I would definitely recommend this collar.
__label__2	LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR: This walking collar has the greatest design. I do not have to have great upper body strength to control my excited boxer. She walks next to me like she is supposed to. No more pulling me down the street. Bravo
__label__1	Flawed Design.: My 10 month old lab chewed through this product within five minutes of his first walk. Thank god for the safety connected to the collar or who knows what would have happened.The design has a strap that goes right over the side of the mouth area. As the dog opens and closes their mouth, the strap goes tight and slack. When the strap is slack, the dog can chew on it. I would say that this is a major design flaw on a product designed to restrain your dog while on a walk.I wouldnt say that my dog is particularly bright so if he can figure this out within 5 minutes on his first walk I'm sure any dog can. If you are going to buy this, please make sure you attach the safety strap to the collar.
__label__2	Take More Pixs: I upgraded to the 128 MB Smart Media card by Simpletech and was very happy with the added storage ability for photos. It's well worth it. It's rugged, fast and works with other devices. More bang for the buck. Get it!
__label__1	Not compatible with all Smart Media devices: Although this card fit well into my Rio500 MP3 player, I had to call Simpletech's 800 # and punch through a long phone tree to reach a helpful technician. He explanined that Rio 500's can't take more than 64MB, so I'll have to send it back and pay for shipping.Find a way to verify compatibility before ordering.
__label__1	SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands: I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. I timed how long it took to copy the same 5MB file to each card. The result: the other cards took 32 seconds and the SimpleTech took 38 seconds. So, my results show that the SimpleTech is about 18% slower than the others. That's important to me because when I take action shots I'm often waiting for the previous image to write to disk before I can take the next shot.
__label__2	Get it, your digital camera will love you for it!: I purchased a brand new Fuji FinePix A201 and wanted to take more pictures with it... came with a small Smartmedia card. So I decided to upgrade and get the Simpletech 128MB SM card. Now I can take a bunch of pictures without changing SM cards so often. Oh yeah, get the Simpletech Smartmedia Flashlink reader, it will get your images from your camera to the PC fast!!
__label__1	Worst Alternate Idea: This is the latest in the stargate movies, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know.While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.As this movie Sorry Stargate fans it is not worth it.
__label__1	disappointed: I've seen better episodes on TV. Forgettable, don't even remember what it was about and it wasn't long ago that I saw it.
__label__1	This is the single worst quality blu-ray I have seen yet.: The movie was ok, as much as a let down as 200 was, but at least it was ok.Blu-ray on a decent TV makes this thing look like utter and complete crap.I returned it to the store to get the DVD because at least that doesn't look as bad.The lack of quality on the picture makes me ashamed to be a fan.
__label__1	Stargate: Continuum: I didn't recieve the DVD at all, was really looking forward to watching it :( makes me sad....... Wendy Johnson
__label__1	Not a fan of Continuum: I was disappointed.My wife, who is the big stargate fan, was also. She watched it a second time and said she was glad she bought it ... after being really disappointed on the first viewing.If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw. It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.Anyway, glad to give my opinion for what it is worth.Save your money for something that is worth watching.
__label__1	Bad return service: I was shipped two when I order only one! The return menu did not have a selection that covered the return and I was charged shipping to return the extra item!
__label__1	Stargate Continuum: Not bad but could have been a lot better. Overall it was dissapointing. They could have at least noted what happened to the Ori after leaving fans hanging with the series ending. Not worth buying.
__label__2	Great for any Stargate Fan!: Too bad good shows do not last forever, but this DVD continues the Stargate tradition. It is good fun!
__label__2	"A Nice Continuation: I thought ""Continuum"" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise. There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama. Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance. This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection."
__label__2	Continuum: Good fun. There's action amd tension and lightness to make gripping and entertaining a storyline that might otherwise be somewhat predictable. Ben Browder in particular manages to inject pathos and humour as well as being delightful eye candy.Highly recommended.
__label__2	Pretty good.: This movie is pretty good. It didn't require an indepth knowledge of the TV show to follow the movie.
__label__2	Great movie.: If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
__label__2	great: It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
__label__2	Stargate Continuum: So glad I purchased the movie. I love the Stargate series and this was very good. The story line and characters kept the action moving
__label__2	Great job on this one: I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story. This, however, was a really, really good film. It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one. The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.It wasn't perfect, however.People vanishing from an altered timeline... That just doesn't happen. There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers. Great job by everyone.Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!
__label__1	"A Stargate Movie: My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in ""SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak"". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."
__label__2	A GREAT story, BUT ......: I REALLY enjoyed this movie. And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back. Uhhh ... DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise.
__label__2	The best of SG-1: This is a great episode. It was good to see Don Davis as General George Hammond for the last time. It was a parade of many loved characters, though Braytac and Dr. Fraiser were missing. I love the alternate universe stories and this was just as good. I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Star Gate.
__label__2	"Continuum makes the grade!: A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
__label__2	A great series and great movies: I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori. I think that anyone who liked the series should get it. I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
__label__2	"One of the top 3 Stargate movies ever made.: Spoiler Free ReviewThe title there is a joke since this is the third movies in the series, along with The original feature that spawned the series, and the ""Ark of Truth."" I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I expected. The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.My biggest complaint is the time traveling and alternate timeline themes didn't do enough to capture your imagination the way ""Back to the Future"" films do. But if you are a Stargate Fan, this is a can't miss DVD/bluray."
__label__1	Yawn: I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series.
__label__1	disappointed: I read all those wonderful reviews and then watched the film. I was disappointed and felt like another reviewer - let down.I have been a Stargate SG1 and Stargate Alantis fan for years. It was cool to see them together for a brief few moments but then it turned out to be another episode. Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development? This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner. Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind. Admittedly, I did rewind the first time but then didn't bother for the second and third. I was getting bored.I wish it was more and I think the disappointment was in I expected it to be more than just another episode. Everything was so predictable - a cash cow.I am so glad I rented. I won't waste my money.
__label__1	Stunk: I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
__label__1	Seriously Disappointing: The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing.
__label__2	Stargate SG1...Continuum: I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last! They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations.
__label__2	Excellent fun!: The Ark of Truth was an o.k. movie. I liked it because it is Stargate and because I wanted to see the actors again. Continuum, on the other hand, is superb. The story is great, the actors are fabulous - that's what SG1 was all about a couple of years ago.
__label__2	"Stargate: The Review: Slow at times, but overall an excellent and fun addition to the Stargate story. Over the years I've thoroughly enjoyed any episode that deals with using the gate for other purposes than just ""going off-world"" - intentionally or unintentionally. The way this story happened - as a result of Ba'al trying to manipulate an entire galaxy just to save himself from being destroyed (how self-absorbed the Goau'ld can be) - seemed very in-line with the Stargate universe and a natural adventure SG-1 would have.I like the treat at the end with the picture in the locker.From a strictly ""Amazon.com purchaser"" perspective, I pre-ordered the item and it arrived within 24-hours, even with 2-day shipping. Package was whole and unspoiled (no shipping mishaps) when it was delivered."
__label__2	Awesomeness: As sad as it is that the series had to end, at least they have awesome movies to follow it up with.
__label__2	Excellent!: This is a great addition to the Stargate universe. You see all the favorite characters and get an actual end to an on-going storyline. I enjoy it a lot.
__label__1	"Continuum, can't compare to Ark: Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (""2001"" or ""2010"") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."
__label__1	"Borrow, don't buy!: A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Better than ""Ark of Truth"",but not much."
__label__2	Stargate is Great: Really miss this show. It is fun to watch the episodes and see the characters interplay. I am ready for the next Stargate show to begin.I did not realize how long the show had been on for.
__label__2	Great Movie: Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch
__label__2	Wow! Great Movie: What a great addition to the SG-1 series. This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series. I think everyone from the writers, actors, and production crew were spot on with this movie.
__label__2	"Best ""Episode"" Yet: I love Stargate SG-1 and I've seen every episode, most more than once, and I think Continuum is the best ""episode"" yet. It is truly movie quality and belongs on the big screen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, not just Stargate fans."
__label__2	Outstanding: Even for someone who wasn't a huge fan of the show, this movie is a must see. Clever story, great flick!
__label__2	Ausome! but...: If you liked Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, or Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Then you will most likely enjoy this film. The plot was... different. I enjoyed it but it seemed to go by fast.Stars: *****
__label__2	A feature length episode, but a good one: With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al. He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day. Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching. But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run.
__label__2	Miss the series: I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie.
__label__2	"Loved This one, but I hated the ""Ark Of Truth."": Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."
__label__2	StarGate Fan: Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement.
__label__2	In My World of Stargate Continuum: It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. The seller was fast, the package was secured, and more important, I was happy when I got it. Once it arrived, I took it out of the package and popped it in the DVD player. When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go. I am now starting my collection of the series since there are a lot of episodes I've never gotten to see. For me, I like watching the behind the scenes portion. I write screenplays myself and so I learn a lot from the director's and actor's point of view. If you're not into that stuff, it's still a kick to watch! I can even deal with the historical babble that Daniel rattles off. Enjoy the ride!
__label__1	"DisCONTINUUM immediately!: The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
__label__1	A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down: I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline.
__label__1	My least favorate episode,or movie of any stargate: I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!
__label__1	Not satisfied: I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners
__label__1	Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray.
__label__2	I Loved This Movie: I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it. I think it would have been even better if he had gone with them to save the world at the end, but regardless of that I still have to give the movie 5 stars.
__label__1	pleasent fluff: this was pleasent and satifying fluff. It's always worth while to watch Baal's machinations, but it would have played better as an episode.Sorry I can't say more.
__label__2	Stargate Continuum: I enjoyed this movie but I still want more...I absolutely loved Stargate SG1, the relationships among the actors was fabulous. If you are a diehard fan like myself you will love this movie as well.
__label__2	another continuem: a solid stargate movie but verry anticlimatic it just ends to fast in the end and left a lot to desire
__label__2	I Approve: Watch it you will enjoy it. I not a fan of the Stargate series, but I enjoyed how this cleaver concept was exercuted in this self contained episode.
__label__2	stargate sg1 continuum: If you like sg-1 and the adventures dealing with time travel, this movie is quite enjoyable. Yes, some of the old sequences are there (Teal'c as first prime but wants to be free), but, new twists with Vala and Ba'al. The story still leaves open the idea that other Goaul'd may be around, but the last major god has been vanquished.
__label__2	Amazingness in DVD form =): Richard Dean Anderson brings so much to this latest installment of the SG-1 saga. RDA, the entire cast, a wicked awesome plot, and the fact that the arctic scenes were shot on location makes this movie all that much more awesome!
__label__2	Happy Purchase: I love everything that has to do with Stargate. From the original Stargate movie with Kurt Russell and James Spade to the Stargate SG1 Series and Stargate Atlantis, I've been hooked for a while now. I love these shows and will always be a fan.
__label__2	Too little too late: This would have been a good season finale and season start, but to do it as a farewell episode. I liked the Ark of Truth better. This episode had a lot of concentrated action and a lot of wasted time. They could have made it longer with a bit more of what happens to them when they are not involved. It was not their best effort but it was still Stargate.
__label__1	"Old plots with very little action.: Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
__label__1	Blu-ray quality same as upconverted DVD: The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before. There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great). Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself. When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof? The paradoxes are ridiculous.. like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US. if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place. where did Baal get Anubis's ship? how did Daniel's leg reappear? why make mitchell the hero? you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.I think the only thing I enjoyed was Vala as a villain.
__label__1	"Close but no cigar: This movie includes all of the traditional ""Stargate"" favorites, from Jack O'Neill to General Landry, but without the humor that made the series so enjoyable. It plays as though the writers and the director had a checklist instead of a script. Quip for Oneill-check, Brilliant insight by Carter-check, Moral stance for Daniel Jackson-check. None of the elements are truely integrated. Watching this convoluted tale was a large disappointment."
__label__2	coolest movie ever!!!!!: i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth movie... this one is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the continued story line of the evil but suave gould Bal is just so well crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat/sofa/bean bag... what ever your setting on:) if you are a huge sg-1 fan, you have to watch this!
__label__2	great item: SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does.
__label__2	Could have been better.: I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over.
__label__2	Good movie... Stargate SG-1 is still a good team...: Stargate: Continuum is a good movie that brings together all of the SG-1 characters again... This is a funny & poignant movie, full of some surprises, that creates a dramatic to way to more or less tie up some loose ends when the series ended. I enjoyed it.
__label__2	Stargate fan: I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. This movie was excellent. I would highly recommend it.
__label__2	Waited too long to buy one!: The best rice we've ever made. All claims provided by Cooks Illustrated are true. Excellant product that is so easy to use!
__label__1	This rice cooker is a disappointment to Asia!: my rice cooker of 10 years just crapped out and i read bunch of reviews and that really didn't help me. since this got so many reviews and most of them good i ordered it and the price is right. well, it makes rice but if you eat rice every day but don't want to make it every day then this rice cooker isn't for you. the steamer plug thing kicks back tons of water back into the pot so you get this really really wet spot. then there is this hot spot so it starts to burn and the bottom starts to get really crispy a couple of hours into the warm position. then after about 12 hours it starts to get this wet rag smell. gross!!
__label__1	Not Good: Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product.
__label__1	Difficult to clean: I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. My old rice cooker had a separate lid and I never noticed this difference in my research. This one is fixed on. I wish I had read the review that said the same thing I am now saying and took note. It's impossible to clean around all the gaskets and time consuming to try. Major design flaw. Other than that, it does make great rice.
__label__1	Not worth the money...: After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again.
__label__2	"Perfect rice, every time: This rice cooker is so easy to use: decide how many cups of rice to make, throw it in, put in water up to the line that matches the number of cups of rice, close the lid and plug it in, and you're done. Total cooking time for one cup of white rice, which is about right for two people, is about 15-20 minutes. We've noticed that leaving the rice in the cooker for an extra 10 minutes after it switches to ""warm"" produces perfect rice almost every time.Buy this cooker and stop trying to cook rice in a pot. Perfect rice with no effort is no longer just a dream."
__label__1	Rice cooker: Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
__label__1	defective after 1 month: Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit.
__label__2	Nice job.: Spattered a bit, but did a good job of making rice. Porridge? Do they mean oatmeal? What about cooking macaroni and cheese--no info for that in booklet. Have not tried it for soup.
__label__1	Huge disappointment!: I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand. Pay the extra money to get a real Japanese one, not an import.
__label__1	You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker.: The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
__label__1	Easy Rice: I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect.
__label__1	worst rice cooker: After i reviewed various rice cookers in Amazon, I bought this one,hoping rice warm and fresh for at least 24 hours. I was wrong. First time I thought I cooked rice wrong to have dry rice on the surface, on the bottom almost no taxture porridge kind of rice within 24 hours . No. it wasn't my cooking method. This is so poorly made rice cooker, even it is said keep rice at least 24 hours fresh. I am wondering how this one get so much good review. This is another reason not to buy at the Amazon,if you are not sure about the item. Buy your local store, and return it when products disppointed in you. I had few cheap rice cookers, couldn't keep rice warm, at least it dosen't make rice dry and porridge at same time. Don't buy this products. Amazon suggest customers no returnable item to sell in their market place, how dare to sell this item to another person, I feel shame to do about this rice cooker.
__label__1	Don't like this at all...: I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace.
__label__2	Perfect: I bought this specifically for making brown rice as I could never get a good texture on a conventional stove -- it's makes wonderful brown rice.
__label__1	non-stick coating peel off after 6 month: I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years.
__label__2	"Basic and just right: This Sanyo rice cooker is just right for cooking rice (what a concept!). It's a plain Jane, but does the job very well. The cooked rice is tender without being mushy, the grains individual and not stuck together in a gummy mess. It's easy to adapt rice cooker recipes - ""The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" is a terrific companion and clean-up is fast.If you're looking for a basic rice cooker without the bells and whistles of various programs, this is a good one to choose."
__label__2	good cooker: Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm. So now I just double check 5-10 min after. Works well for brown rice.
__label__2	Rice Cooker: This is an AMAZING product! It makes PERFECT rice every time, never sticks to the pot and is amazingly easy cleanup! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!
__label__2	Yuki: It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet.
__label__1	ok, while it lasted....: It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened....
__label__2	"darned, good rice cooker: i'd read/ researched much before purchasing this item. checked ""Consumer Reports"" as well as read many reviews about his particular model. most were helpful/ spot on: this is probably the best little bugger out there on the market today for the price (which we thought was reasonable). i'd have given 5/5 stars be it not for the pesky, little, plastic condensation capturer-thingy-device on the back of the unit. it does its job OK but is a bit of a struggle to get re-situated in place after emptying, cleaning, etc. it cooks rice to perfection, clean-up is a breeze, etc. however, the plastic spoon that comes w/ the product doesn't fit very well into the resting ""slot"" affixed to the side of the top lid. other than those two, slight ""inconveniences"", the product is terrific."
__label__2	"Works as Advertised: Being Japanese-American, I have been raised around rice cookers since birth. The old models my family used had the lid bobbing on the steam being generated; the rice was perfect regardless. The ""fancy"" models now being sold for over a $100 are overkill. This machine follows the ""KISS"" principle to a T. While the lid doesn't bobble anymore due to the vent, it works fine. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I cannot see the water level markings. They are the same color as the non-stick coating."
__label__1	"Broke!: This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
__label__2	A book that fills the gap in Polish inter-war history.: For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery. This book fills that gap admirably. It reveals how Jozef Pilsudski was truly the founding father of a reborn nation. This is his story just as much as Poland's, but then the two are so closely tied together that their's is one story. A fascinating and easy read. Thoroughly recommended to those who have an interest in this area.
__label__2	Great Resource!: This is a fantastic resource for any teacher. The ideas generated in this book are invaluable and can be modified for any age/grade level. Forms are instantly usable. Great for someone who's never seen a rubric right up to those who use them all of the time. I can't wait to share it with all the teachers at my school!
__label__2	"Rubrics for Elementary Assessment : Classroom Ready Blacklin: Great tool for the primary classroom. Best purchase I've made in years for my teaching and assessment. No more questioning of ""why"" a grade is given. Well worth the price!!"
__label__2	mu-sic , n.: Musiq Soulchild: This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son.
__label__2	Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!1: I've only had it for less than 2 weeks, and have to buy another one because I've scratched it taking it between the car and house. You have got to get this cd if you haven't already! Number 9, 10, and second part of 11 are my favorites.
__label__2	"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT: I have to say that this Musiq's best cd so far. His lyrics are just so...real. Unlike rappers... he doesn't sing about the same thing over and over...he sings about real situations....like is ""babymother"" OMG I LOVEEE that song...KEEP IT UP MUSIQ!!!!"
__label__1	TAKE OFF THE SHADES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I got a song:why did i buy it?the second was wack tooi'm such a foolfor those shades hiding cross-eyed dudesi hated the singleit was 9.99how bad could it benow i'm selling it for free
__label__1	"Don't Believe The Hype!: I am a fan of Musiq - don't get me wrong. I really liked his first two albums, so I was thoroughly outraged when I bought/heard ""Soulstar"". Nowhere on the same level! It lacks so much of the ""soul"" that ironically labels it. Honestly, pick up ""Dwele - Subject"" or ""Kem - Kemistry"" instead. This album is not hot, don't believe the hype! And whoever said that Musiq in on the same level as Maxwell, must be deaf! At any rate, the best song on the entire album is ""forthenight"" (for the night), which they play so frequently on the radio. If you're curious, let one of your friends lend it to you (if they have it), or ask them to burn it for you... I wouldn't recommend blowing your hard-earned moolah on this soul-less atrocity. ;o("
__label__2	Musiq makes good musiq: This is a nice album. Not really a 5 star album, but I still like it. My favorite track is Babymother. I love the subject and chorus of this song. If you like Musiq, cop it.
__label__1	Mr.Average: and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short.
__label__1	Whack: What's good with this album. His first album was a classic and the second was good. This is just whack. His voice is not up to par like Glenn Lewis, Bilal, Maxwell and D'Angleo. Come on,are some of you people deaf? He can't carry a note.
__label__2	How could you say a bad word about it???: I don't understand how anyone can possibly trash this CD. If you ever liked Musiq you should def. love this CD--From the incredible Soulstar intro to the very end of Givemorelove/Leaveamessage. The whole Cd is a standout against all other music in the insdustry. He's def. an original artist.Please don't let these reviewes sway you against buying this CD--listen to the samples yourself and if you dont like it you just don't like music/musiq.
__label__2	Musiq does it again!!!: When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!
__label__2	Gon' hed Musiq: I love this CD..I am a big Musiq fan.. This cd is good from beginning to end. The musiq is very pretty..and what I love about him is that he is so creative he talks about things other people really dontMy favorite tracks are#1 Soulstar#3 Womanolopy#6 whoknows..very pretty track#7 babymother...I love this track#12 Her#13 whereareyougoingall the real Musiq fans stand up..and go get my boy's cd..its tight..it deserves more than 5 stars
__label__1	Is Musiq losing his touch?: This by far was the worst of the three albums from Musiq. It definetly does not live up to the traditional Musiq style that I am used to. The lyrics are ok, but the beats are not as tight as the first album which was by far the best. Or even the second album which was not as good as the first but it was ok. It seems like with each album Musiq's rhythms start to wander off. Musiq is known for his beats, rhythms, sounds and mezmorizing words in his songs. Did he get new producers or something? If so he needs to go back to the original ones because this album is the worst by far. Musiq I know you can do much better!
__label__2	"Chalk another good CD for Musiq: Musiq's new CD is fantastic effort. Even though his music has generally maintained the same format, there are some slight differences with this CD than his previous ones. It seems as if he went for more of an orchestrated feel with this one. In many songs, there are quite a but of this. And it works out really well. There are a lot of strong tracks on here. My favorite tracks are ""moment in life"" w/Kindred and Cee-Lo, ""womanopoly"" and ""infatueighties"". There's pretty much only one song I can't stand and that is ""miss you"". And there's another song that I'm indifferent about, so this prohibits me from giving it a perfect 5 stars, but this is nothing but quality and I would definitely recommend it to most fans of R&B and Hip-Hop. At least those who aren't swayed by most of the mainstream trash that they hear on the radio."
__label__2	A Soul Star he is: this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. I'm addicted. There is nothing sad on this album (except for the very serious song babymother {about becoming an unexpectant father}). It's a feel good CD. Even the leaveamessage track is fun.
__label__2	LOVE!: I really like his music and enoy to listening to it all the time. I would recommend this cd to everyone.
__label__2	Quality: Thanks for giving me such a great product. I could not tell that this CD was used at all. It was taken very well care of. No scratches, skips or anything! Keep up the good work!
__label__2	"Best Album So far!!!!!!: Musiq did it again every song on here i like to some sort but my favorite, favorite , is ""Momentinlife"" with kindred and cee-loguiness!!!I recommend this to all the ""real musiq Lovers""I agree with the other person who said that Kindred was overlooked cause that was the truth. They did not get the credit that was due. come on yall lets get the Real Artist to the top cause that is where Real music Lives and is created. They Deserve it! But anyway Musiq Wonderful job it just gets better and better."
__label__1	F for effort: COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly? Baby Mama Drama? What about love longs and decent ones at that. The second CD was a keeper. Musiq should practice his craft or lose a fan. Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it.
__label__1	The second was better, the first was best: I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe, hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again.
__label__2	Reflective and Multi-layered: Still Love in Strange Places takes readers on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Kephart is really asking the questions, To whom do memories and stories belong? and How are cultural legacies passed down to a child. A fascinating book.
__label__1	Don't waste your time: If you want to play chess, go grab a real chess board.1. The two player mode isn't really two players. You have to share the same controller. Yes, you literally have to pass the controller back and forth for every move.2. No one plays this game on Xbox Live.
__label__2	"Searched for this song...: Heard the song on Charlie's Angels movie and it wasn't listed on the soundtrack. Did some research and finally found the song. Love the ""dance"" music beat!"
__label__2	very happy: These are great tires for my old beach cruiser. Size was perfect and a fraction of the price the bike shop charges!
__label__2	I disagree with just about all of these reviews...: These are the same games you remember from the eighties....of course they seem basic by today's standards, but if you loved them like I did you will be very happy with this game. No duh pac man and ms. pacman are the same game....we knew that in 1983. The point is, you will likely buy this game out of nostalgia, not because you are looking for the next huge special effects dynamo p.c. game. If you loved these games 20 years ago, you'll enjoy the heck out of this game because they are the exact same games simply made playable on the Xbox.
__label__1	won't play on my xbox: when I insert the disk the screen says you must attach hard drive to play. i have a 4 gig hard drive attached but it still won't play
__label__1	Poor renditions of classic games: These versions do not play like the original games. I'm amazed that they don't just write an emulator so that they can get their games right!
__label__1	Not Just a Name: Just like a real museum, everything in Namco Museum is OLD. I grew up in the 80's. I played Atari and Colico. I remember Pong, Missile Command and many others. I remember that they only kept my attention for about twenty minutes at a time.
__label__1	"Industrial, though not ""Professional"": I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals ""I Didn't See It Coming"" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."
__label__2	"Five Stars For Children's Version: This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones. There are no bawdy barroom scenes. Levity is provided by the addition of several animals. Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that ""parrots"" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat. Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of ""color"" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back."
__label__2	I think Scratch was exciting and romantic in this book.: I feel Scratch had to have closure on the past as he had to find out the three men he first road with had in deed betrayed him and took his firs and left him to fend for his self. I am glad Scratch found the men and set things right. We need more of Titus C. Bass pleasd don't let him fade into the sunset.
__label__2	"More than happy!: This book arrived looking just as nice as a brand new one, even though it was listed as, ""Used."" Very pleased and would highly recommend this seller!"
__label__2	short and complete: I recommend this book to all of my friends because it is very thorough and very short! This is especially helpful if the other parent isn't much of a reader (at least about child development) I highlight a few chapeters when I want my husband to understand more about what our daughter is going through.
__label__2	Every second counts: Will my future change because of this one second I stopped to look at this dress in the window? Will I alter other peoples' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie. 'Run Lola Run', a German movie, is fantastically made and keeps your heart beating rapidly down to the last second of it. Lola's boyfriend got into trouble. And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip. Fast, unstopable, exciting. And the one minute you spent thinking about getting this movie will change your life.
__label__2	Everything as advertised.: I saw this movie in my German class, and I thought it was a cool enough movie to buy and own. The DVD did not disappoint : )
__label__2	"Totally Engrossing!: I don't think I have ever watched a movie move as fast as this one--couldn't believe it when it was over. It's exciting, innovative, visually perfect, and accompanied by terrific music. The characters are appealing and interesting. There was never a slow moment nor a wasted frame. ""Run Lola Run"" is as good as it gets."
__label__2	"Lots of form, and lots of fun....: Not quite sure what was going on here....kinda reminded me of a cross between Groundhog Day and the multiple-endings in ""Clue"", but fun nonetheless. Very energetic film that FLIES by!This DVD edition features and English soundtrack, as well as the German soundtrack, and the english subtitles can be turned on if you are a purist watching the German-language version. Also, the disc is two-sided, one side being full-screen, the other being letterbox."
__label__2	Very interesting.... like nothing i have seen before: In my German class, one boy brought this movie in. I really didn't know what to expect, because most movies we see in German class are a bit old.. this one is very different, and creative. I have never seen anything so different, and imaginative. It is very well done, and interesting. Nothing that anyone should miss seeing.
__label__2	A little gem of a movie: Not as complex as my ten years ago memory of it recalled, but that's not a bad thing. This is a little gem of a movie which tells its tale with economy and verve.
__label__2	(Panting sound): Whoa! This movie literally took my breath away. Its fast paced the whole time never letting up. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing. Forget the VHS get the DVD its cheaper and has extra scenes and interviews. The plot is like nothing ive ever seen before. Buy this and you won't regret it.
__label__2	RUN out and get LOLA now!: So many people here have said so many great things about this startlingly original and innovative film that I'll just simply echo it all. From the music, which fits this film better than any soundtrack ever has before (the visual to music rhythm sync job is incredible), to the break all the rules camera work (not a single cross-cut or quick-cut was superfluous!), to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten. For myself, I'd say it's easily among the top 25 of this decade. Yes, it's that exciting, amazing, and original. I don't have a DVD player yet, but this will almost assuredly be my first purchase, even before THE MATRIX.
__label__1	"Run Away, Run: Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run"""
__label__2	Incredible! The best ever!: I rented this DVD online and was on the edge of my seat,glued to the screen and never blinked until the end! I hit title repeat right away and went amazon to buy one and gift-click four more to web friends.I will remember this film forever!If Run Lola Run was up for a little golden man it would expose the others as impotent,unoriginal bits of trash.
__label__1	What a disappointment: My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!
__label__1	"i dont fully comprehend the fascination with this movie: I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay. I thought the experimental ""and then"" parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the otherGroundhog Dayin how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though."
__label__2	"It's creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people.: It's creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people. I can't see too deep a meaning from this ""music video with a plot"". Admittedly it's a must buy for it's originality."
__label__1	"ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ: Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
__label__1	Monotonous and annoying: If you like thumping, loud, monotonous music, you may like this film better than I did. With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation, I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time.
__label__1	I cannot believe...: I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless...
__label__1	Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it.: It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it.
__label__1	"Ich weiß ja nicht !: Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir ""wie lange rennt die denn noch"" und ""warum rennt die schon wieder"". Mein Freundin fand den Film aber echt klasse. Von den vier Leuten die wir waren gibt einer 5 Sterne, 2 geben drei Sterne und ich gebe dem Film 2 Sterne. Würde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."
__label__2	Run Lola Run - foreign film: It's like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Three days, lived over sequentially (same day) and this lady has to RUN across the city looking for a way to keep her boyfriend from being killed by the mob. Each time it ends in his death, then the last time she dies and he's the one who 'saves' her. Their next day completely shifts their life for the better & they're out of the perpetual loop.This actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape! Interesting premise. Fun watching the same people in the background in certain scenes where THEIR lives evidentally are very different each time around.I'd recommend it.
__label__2	Good Movie: Yeah, its a foreign movie, but dont let that fool you. It was a good movie. Very different too.
__label__2	Awesome Film: Get the German Version with the English Subtitles. Yes, the techo music gets annoying but it's a really good movie. You'll see lots of recurring themes of this in the near future. How everything you do, regardless of how small, has some impact on the rest of the world. There's a show on the Discovery channel called Connections with James Burke that details how everything is related to everything else. Yet it all appears to be a big mess of chaos. It's beautiful in it's insanity.
__label__2	can't say enough good things about this movie: just incredible...The acting, directing, and pacing are all perfect! Watching this with the volume up is a surreal experience.Buy it! ;)
__label__2	Fun, Fast and Beautiful: An amazing movie, not as fast and furious as people would have you believe, but breathtaking and suspenseful. Franka Potente is absolutely hypnotizing as Lola and the overall feel of the movie is romantic and fun. The dvd includes some fun extras, like Franka Potente's music video 'I Believe' and audio commentary by Franka and the director. Although translation is cumbersome sometimes, I would definately recommend the subtitled version over the dubbed(both are included on the dvd). In a word, astounding!
__label__2	"Creative and Refreshing: This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It was fast pace and very entertaining. I really enjoy the ""ending."" The lead character Lola is awesome she is tough and also very feminine at the same time. I would highly recommend this film."
__label__2	QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER: To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too.
__label__1	Three words: empty, repetitive and boring: I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please.....
__label__1	"What a waste!: ""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
__label__1	Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola: I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring...
__label__1	she never stops running: ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. yea well dnt watch this one cause u will just fall asleep and still not know the film is about her running and runninga and running and running and u get the picture
__label__1	Run Money Run!: This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness.
__label__1	running on empty: Her pusher boyfriend needs his junk, and his girlfriend missed the connection?Yeah? So what?Watch him get on the phone to her and freak out. Repeatedly.Just tired of films about drugs and users and that entire scene.Shot in that annoying MTV music-video style.When will directors learn to stop swirling the camera and allow the actors to do what they were hired to do?Not a complicated concept at all, filmmakers. Leave the actors alone. That's right: point the camera at them and let them show that they can act. How about that? If they can't act, hire someone who can--but please stop the idiotic camera tricks. Tony Scott does it, Tarantino does it, Robert Rodriguez does it... Why? Because they don't trust their minimal talent. That's exactly why.You're giving us a headache, man. Get it? If I want my brain to ache I'll take a rollercoaster ride.
__label__2	This movie has it all: You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a movie or tv show or commercial that you like? Well, take all of those and put them in one movie and this is what Run Lola Run is - and they made it almost 10 years ago! If you haven't seen this, treat yourself and get it.
__label__2	Perfect: If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you. It was easy to follow, and it had the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspence. For an added bonus they threw in some sweet techno music that you have to love.
__label__1	Amelie on Acid: This pic reminds me a bit of Amelie, but much better. Amelie was cutsie and this is an action pic. Unfortunately, the running does get a bit tiresome, though it is interesting for much of its running time.
__label__2	"Asolutely fantastic: ""Lola rennt"" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. I especially love it because it is none of the typical German Hollywood imitations which have flood the video market for years. Indeed I have never watched a similar film. It spreads hope and makes us realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own destiny and that we always should think before we act."
__label__2	Dazzling German Cinema!: This fast-paced, innovative and extremely entertaining German film features an inspired techno soundtrack and great use of editing, camera and sound to tell the story of Lola (Franka Potente) who must figure a way to get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes. This is the excellent premise that shoots off an extremely clever and modern piece of foreign cinema. Great performance, great story, kinetic pace, excellent techno soundtrack and attentive direction make this film and it's filmmaker one of the most promising things to come out of Germany in the 90's. Highly Recommended. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!
__label__2	RUN To The Video Store and Buy This: This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection.
__label__2	German Film returns with a smash...: Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film. It is a fast paced heart pounder which leaves you lterally breathless afterwards. The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully. The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well. The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed. this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999. Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries. i hope to see more great exports soon!
__label__2	I must add my voice: to those who are praising this movie. It is fun, it is profound, it is whimsical, it is confrontational--everything that Hollywood movies are not. It is the kind of movie that demands repeated viewings. A MUST BUY!
__label__2	Direct Hit: This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed.
__label__2	"Fabulous acting & soundtrack...you must see this movie!: I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think ""Sliding Doors"" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"
__label__1	All style, no substance: There are so many good things in this movie that I really wish that I could've liked it more. But, as it is, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of a video game. If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders.
__label__1	"Different kind of movie!: I bought the dvd of this movie after I read all those positive feedback from other viewers. However, this is not the type of movie that I'll be willing to wait for more than a month for viewing. As an overseas buyer,the movie, shipment waiting time, and the cost of buying it all doesn't meet my high expectation/anticipation level of the movie. I was expecting something more like ""Le femme Nikita"" not a story of 2 youngsters having three different ending of their problems. The only good thing from this movie, for me, is the music! Two thumbs up for the music selection..."
__label__1	A waste of time & money: I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German movie making.The use of cartoons takes much away from the story. I don't think I have patience to watch it againso I will probably trash it.
__label__2	My Favorite Foreign Film: I usually don't like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings. (Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)
__label__2	this is a must: this movie is like art. well-planned scenes and very sofisticated camera shots makes it a very beautiful movie. this is one of those must-have's that should belong among those classic movies that never fade with time.
__label__2	"Ever Wonder ""What If"": Ever wonder ""What If""? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!"
__label__2	Non-Stop Thrillride!: Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride! This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack. Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her. As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture. The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced! All in all, an excellent movie!
__label__2	innovative piece of cinema: this is not the perfect film, however it is engagingly inventive and intelligent. the reality bending techniques (animated scenes, split second montages, and three separated sequences) expand the dimensions of cinema. no film in recent history has been able to break the norms of standard film so gracefully. if anything, it's worth renting, however it's not for everyone. it has a distinct taste that won't appeal to everyone. which is part of it's magic, it doesn't pander to what audiences want, it gives the audience what it needs: creativity.
__label__2	"Fun Lola Fun: The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Of course, they want to kill him. Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money. And of course, she realistically doesn't have enough time to do it.What to do? Get the cash from Rich Banker Daddy? Steal the money? Win it?This is a Euro-slick film, shot like a music video. It asks, ""So she failed that time...but what if she tried it ANOTHER way?"" The audience follows Lola as she chases down the money...she does it again and again.Even though Manny is no choirboy, and Lola is not exactly Mother Teresa, you cheer for her and urge her on as the action speeds up. I liked Lola because she faces the problem head-on and then does what she's gotta do. The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy-handed angst European films so often get slammed for."
__label__2	Captivating Indie: Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right. But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation. Without giving away too much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life.
__label__2	The most unlikely scenario . . .: This is a good movie for learning German, since phrases are repeated from scenario to scenario. As for the plot:Supposedly, the third and final scenario is the true one. However, this is the most unlikely one. Somehow, in a city the size of Berlin, Manni is able to find the same homeless man who has his bag of money, and Lola gambles and wins 100 thousand DM, all in less than 20 minutes. The first two scenarios, in which Lola or Manni resorts to robbery and Manni or Lola is injured, are actually the more likely ones. Perhaps RUN LOLA RUN is poking fun at how neatly things usually turn out in movies.
__label__2	What a fun movie!: I liked it. It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good. Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.I give this a big thumbs up!
__label__2	Don't miss Lola !: This is a whole new experience in film. It's brilliant, innovative, and so much fun ! Fast paced, with a great pulsating score, it plays with time and shows you how a few seconds can change your life..the editing is a marvel, as well as the cinematography. (Love the ambulance/glass shot !). This incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings. It's a keeper !
__label__2	Great Movie!: Great Movie! Really makes you think. It is based on the theory that every second of every day determins your ultimate fate and even if one second was different, it could change your whole life. There are twists and turns in this movie as Lola races to protect the destiny of her lover. Run Lola Run!
__label__2	Run Lola Run: This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?
__label__2	Had a blast!: This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended.
__label__1	"One word: TRIPE: I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
__label__1	HORRIBLE: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again.
__label__1	"I don't get it ""Nothing thought provoking"" ""Nothing Philosophical"": I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
__label__2	European Film At It's Best: Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation.
__label__2	excellent ....: Original - fun - breathless ... A film & a script very not conventional !! Great !! Not to miss ,,,,
__label__2	A few more chances: If life could be that way, we were all having a few chances to make things right.
__label__2	"A Running Movie: Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the ""real life"" which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!"
__label__2	Simply spectacular!: 'Run Lola Run' was one of the best movies of 1999, IMHO. The creativity behind everything from the plot twists, to the music (the soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic!), to the animated cut-ins, to the soccer analogy absolutely blew me away! This movie is pure fun and excitement; don't miss it!
__label__2	A near-perfect film.: Completely absorbing and hypnotising; this is the single best movie I have ever seen.
__label__1	"This single is bad: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
__label__2	"Worldview grounded in scripture: ""Creation Regained:Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview"" is not your typical worldview book. It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you."

__label__2	"WHATAREYA?: Chances are if yer not Australian yer not gonna understand TISM... from the band that brought you ""Defecate on my Face"" and ""There'll Never Be An Ole Man (River)"" comes their lastest. Tackling the hard issues... ""I might have screwed yer sister but I never screwed yer mum... I might have gone to uni but at least I know I'm dumb""... Yes.. they can rhyme with the best of 'em... but in the end its just good ole fashioned TISM! R U A YOB? nuh... yer a wanker... I'd actually say this was one of the best things out this year."

(Wanker.com) is great in your face music and its got a beat thats nothing i can find in the states. Its a little tough for us Yanks to understand but all that I've made listen to it love it at first hear..the beat and the tunes you just cant stop singing...aka ""whatareya"" & ""yob"" and the second disk ""Aussie Guitar"" is great! hope to seem them soon..."
__label__2	"Who then are TISM?: TISM (This Is Serious Mum) formed in around 1988 and became an overnight success with the release of He'll never be an Ol' man River and Greg the Stop sign in 1994. This is the latest in thier vengance on Australian society. Their fans arn't called fans but rather ""victims"" due to the fact that they are fanatics. They simply state that TISM are gods and all other bands are pop culture tools. Why? Well TISM sing about how pop music is regurgitated crap and that youth follow them like tools of the record companies. If you hate Hanson, Maryln Manson, and disco danc'n. You'll love TISM. Oh, and their into poetry, the condensending sarcastic type. Favourite song off this album; Whatareya?"
__label__1	IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.: You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player.
__label__1	Extremely Unreliable: I bought this product about 11 months ago. However, I've only been able to use it for about 6 months because it keeps malfunctioning. I had to ship it in twice for repairs at my own expense. This last time, they even forgot to ship back the memory card. Now I have to wait again...When it works, the product is great. However, it's so unreliable that it's not worth it. My recommendation is to buy another brand unless Compaq can get their act together.
__label__2	I miss it...: This MP3 player served me well for two years until (because of my clumsiness) I broke it. It worked beautifully, able to play both MP3 and WMA files with ease. Loading files onto the player was a breeze, as was initial setup of the software. The headphones that it comes with are comfortable and have a good amount of volume capability. A great MP3 player, I'm now trying to find a replacement but am finding it difficult to find another that measures up. I miss you, my iPAQ.
__label__1	the mark of the maker: The write-up was not good. This is definitely a children's book(?) Very disappointed.
__label__2	"Good software to learn the basics: This CD is ""fast, fun & user friendly"" just like the good people at Talk Now say. It plays on both Windows and Mac computers. I recommend it for what it is. A beginner's learning tool for the essential words and phases. A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference. I just wish it covered even more of our Tagalog words. Just incase I forget them.hehehe"
__label__2	Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it: My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good.
__label__1	"Defective c/d's: What a disappointment. I was thrilled that Amazon carried this 2-set c/d, but when it arrived it was ""unplayable"". With it's usual efficiency Amazon provided a return label, and I re-ordered the product. The replacement too was unplayable. Obviously a manufacturing error. While I was very disappointed with the product, it renewed my confidence in Amazon to stand by their customer refund policy. This is why I buy everything I can through Amazon. You can't find a better guarantee on the internet, or anywhere else. Thanks Amazon."
__label__1	Camera, yes - Camcorder, no: It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera, but not in my Sony camcorder. It gives a format error. I'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera. If I would have known that it would work only in the camera, I would have purchased the Sony Stick.
__label__2	great subsitute for sony memory stick: Great subsitute for sony memory stick. cost less, same quality
__label__1	More info needed: There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon
__label__1	Two star because....: I haven't used it yet!!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous, wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it. Seriously, what a waste of resources. I can't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging. Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person!!!? ah!! For a MEMORY STICK? Gimme a break!!
__label__2	I love the CD: For non-native speakers this is a God send, the CD provides both British and American pronunciation and I consider this is the most useful feature for this dictionary.Once you installed the CD to your hard drive in full installation mode, then store your CD in a safe place because you don't need it anymore.I highly recommend this to anyone who have a hard time to find how to pronoun the English words.
__label__1	not enlightened: I was looking for a book that was a little more enlightened and a little less materialistic. This author clearly likes to shop (I am not a shopper), so it was hard to relate. Most of the ideas I have read before. I think the title is a little misleading. When I think about meaning, I think of higher ideals -- not just having more time to read a book in a quiet corner of my house. I don't know...I think if you have a strong sense of what brings meaning, you might find this book a bit superficial. Writing is good and there are good quotes too.
__label__2	"This book can help you make money!: Incredible as it may sound ""Investing for Dummies"" was a realpage-turner! I read the entire book in several hours andactually gained some useful investing information. I have sincebeen able to make money in the three weeks since readingthe book. The recommended ""Dummies Approved"" lists are a greatresource. They act as good starting points for the novice toresearch investing ideas."
__label__2	"When He Wrote Plays: American playwrights aren't good at creating a career of playwriting. Why, I can't say. They write dynamically for a given period and then off they go into putting the holy bible on stage or some such epic. They become mystics, like Allen Ginsberg. Shepard wrote plays for a while and then, I think, Hollywood put the zap on him and he was gone. His occasional pieces today are weak imitations of his former self. Money and fame may be responsible. Who knows? Here gathered in a single anthology are the key works, on which his life's reputation rests. ""True West"" sets the stage: we have real dramatic conflict, exciting dialog (of the sort last heard in Albee's ""Zoo Story""), and high theatricality. The rest of the anthology is well worth reading, but for my money Shepard wrote a fine short play but his long and longer pieces are less interesting. Shepard has said in interviews that he sees plays as an outlet for ideas. The problem as I see it is that he has none."
__label__2	an incredible collage of beautiful plays: This collection of plays is extraordinary. Shepard threads tales of cartoonlike characters bound by the direst of circumstances excellently.
__label__2	Great purchase: The book arrived on time and in good condition. This is an excellent collection for both theatre enthusiasts, teachers and for a comprehensive sampling of what Shepard is so gifted at constructing.
__label__2	A Subpar Ripoff of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars: Seriously the art work, music and general theme reek of glam rock.But If you love Ziggy/Bowie and glam era its not bad, reminds me alot of the Velvet Goldmine movie for some reason for its sameless copying of bowies classic album. I picked this up around 1998 in a dumpster bin at a discount music store for probably around 99centsAnd its definately not the worst 99cents I've spent.Velventeen/Glitter Queen = Lady StardustShoeGazer = Ziggy Stardust
__label__2	"This little piggy made the Mama giggle: I borrowed this book from my local library for my 4 yr. old who is in love with ""piggies""! She loved it, as did my 8 yr. old, who giggled and asked me to read it again. We liked it so much, we decided to purchase our own. The rhymes are funny and the illustrations are wonderfully drawn and entertaining. I must admit, I enjoyed it as much as they did."
__label__2	Interesting Romantic Symphonic Music of a Russian Character: I remember reading somewhere that the Dahomeyan Rhapsody, though perhaps inspired by the West African nation, has a distinctly Russian flavor, and this is also certainly true of the symphony. Kalinnikov & Arensky came to mind as I listened to this piece for the first time, and as I listened more and thought less of Russian comparisons and more of De Boeck, the music still strikes me as Russian in the shapes of the melodies, the style of the orchestration, and in the development of the themes. I haven't as yet spent enough time with the violin concerto to feel adequate to advance an opinion, but can assuredly say that if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music you will probably enjoy the symphony and rhapsody, and the adverb 'probably' has no place in this sentence if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music from Russia. For in that case, you will certainly enjoy this music.
__label__1	Boring to Read: Everytime I think of this book I feel to yawn. I was excited to get it but I have to admit I was very bored reading it. The secret of Mr. Hogan's swing was no secret at all. It may have been back then but not now. My apologies to the author. It is just my opinion.
__label__1	Science lover: This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords.
__label__2	A Must Buy!: Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this book! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this book. He shares with us the importance of disciple-making and how to do it correctly and systematically. He tells us what to look for in a potential disciple and the four progressive steps in the life of a Bible student: a convert, a disciple, a worker, and a leader. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of personal discipleship, this book is for you! Does anyone have his email or snail mail address? If so, please email it to me! Thanks.

WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."

__label__2	A Must See Comedy: Flying dagger is one of the funniest movie I have seen this year. The main character in the movie seem weaker than Jimmy character. It seem that bad things always happen to the main character. As for Jimmy, he often get to do all the fighting. I think the girls in here are not good looking. Overall the movie have great comedy and the only good looking person in here have to be Jimmy Lin.
__label__1	Kinda sux: I have had my case for 2 weeks and the leather is peeling off the binding center part. Also, the magnets don't line up right and I have to give it an adjustment to put the iPad to sleep. And last but not least, when I try to fold the cover back so it can stand, it always unfolds itself. If u want a smart cover, I would get the real thing.
__label__1	THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!: This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!
__label__1	waste of money: This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user.
__label__1	Not much of value...: The closest to valuable information this book has is: The % of emails you received compared to the number of times your profile is viewed. There is nothing else here that isn't already listed on most dating web sites themselves. Don't waste your money, just read the information provided by the site(s) that you are a member of.It also appears that this book was sponsored by two specific companies (3 sites) as their name appears all over this book, and the 100's of other sites are ignored.I was surprised to see that this book was only written by two people. It has the disjointed feel of being written by a large group of people. It jumps from talking down to people only looking for sex, to praising how easily you can get sex, to talking down to people whom consider religious compatibility important. And that's just one example. I truly thought that it was written by at least five different authors, and edited by people who didn't speak to each other.
__label__1	save your money: This book is little more than a pamphlet. It's written totally for men in the younger age brackets. I also bought and read I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book: A Commonsense Guide to Successful Internet Dating. That book is much better, and has much broader scope and depth. Save your money on this one.
__label__1	"AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap...with horoscopes?: This brief 100 pages book wastes 25 pages on horoscopes, zodiac signs, what your sign says about you, what signs mean in women, what signs you should date. What do ancient superstitions have to do with the Internet and why does it consume 1/4 of the book? The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: ""some women are after money"" and ""if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father"" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage. The worst, avoid at all costs, even for free at the library. Horoscopes! Gawd."
__label__1	Not reader worthy: I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree.
__label__2	Trés Bien Céline: The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!
__label__2	Céline is at her best in French!: Whenever people criticize me for being a Céline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille & 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer. The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs. Give it a try!
__label__2	The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow: Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET
__label__2	"AF - Absolutely Fabulous: Congrats Celine! Again. She made it. Another big success for releasing this new French CD. Debut #1 in Canada, and France. [...]Anyway, she has tried to sing a little bit more rock 'n' rolls kinda style this time. It's a good try for her, but I still like her ballad, and I highly recommend ""apprends-moi"" and ""je t'aime encore ""."
__label__2	"1F4T: Cet album est chanté vraiment bien. Jean-Jacques et les autres ""types"" ont bien fait! Les chansons sont pas forte en vocales, mais les paroles sont très très émouvantes. Surtout ""Rien n'est vraiment fini"". ""Je Lui Dirai"", c'est le fun. Son premier 45 ""Tout L'Or Des Hommes"" place le feeling pour le reste de l'album. C'est super, a! Achète l'album! a vaut l'argent!"
__label__2	Great CD: I love love love this CD. I dont speak french but its still great. I would recommend this CD to everyone.
__label__2	Brilliant album but not the best of Celine: Excellent album but not as good as her earlier albums en Francais, in terms of the songs' melodies and lyrics. Yet it is still Celine.
__label__2	For anyone who loves great vocals: I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she's singing about. Doesn't matter. This cd is amazing. And what is great is that you don't have to be her typical fan to like it. The production seems different on this cd. It's more of a low key affair but her vocal delivery will blow you away. Check out all the 5 star reviews this cd gets. This is one for a true music lover.
__label__1	"Misleading Advertising: Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
__label__1	Questionable quality: The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!
__label__1	"False advertising: ""Hand decorated""...? Only if that phrase means cheap glued-on paper. I, too, purchased this item primarily for the chest. The chest arrived with the paper already peeling from all corners; on the lid are several raggedy-edged holes in full view. Really disappointing. Does anyone from Bentley actually read the advertising copy?"
__label__2	Nice Gift: The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
__label__1	Good tea/cheap chest: The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. However, the chest is very poorly put together. The applique material does not line up and there are numerous rough edges. Not wht I would want to display on the countertop.
__label__2	Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest: This item is what it mostly says it is. Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale.
__label__2	A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box: This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea. The tea is full of flavor and aroma. This made a great gift for me and will surely please the tea drinkers in your life as well. The box is also nice and my young daughter has plans to store little trinkets in it once it is empty.
__label__1	"Product is fair quality and has poor description: I purchased the Dorman plug boot adapter and find them average in quality. I was looking to buy a ""SET"" of 4 for my 4 cyl Alero and was worried the picture shows only 2 boots but the price made me think it was for 4. the description never says it's for 2 but it's my fault for assuming there would be a complete set. Not real sure why anyone would buy only 2 when it makes for since to buy all 4 when servicing your auto. My bad I guess. Look around, for the price of these 2 boots (around 13 bucks when I bought them) you should be able to buy a complete set."
__label__2	BIG RESULTS IN SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME: I do this video 2-3 times a week and find that I get as good a workout as doing almost 45 mins of freeweights. When I am done with this one, I feel my muscles burning. This is the first time I have seen anyone do a set of exercises one at a time and then incorporate them all together. YOu do a set of bicep curls, then lateral raises, overhead raises and tricep kickbacks. Then you do 2 of each all together. It was fun to do them that way. This tape goes really fast and I would recommend it to anyone who is short of time, but want to do some strength training.
__label__1	Gossip Girl Season 3...: What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!
__label__1	Did not get whole season: Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter's Christmans present turned out to be terrible. Make sure you check your cd's if you order these. They don't send you the whole season but want whole season $$$$. Bought it from Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. Of course I can't return it either.....
__label__2	as described: Ordered for my stepdaughter for Christmas at her request.Arrived very quickly and new as stated.She has watched the series already and loves it - so will ahve to give this an A+.Thank you
__label__1	Scratched disk: Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake.
__label__2	Gossip Girl season 3: arrived a lot quicker than expected and was in condition that was stated. Thanks and I would buy from again!
__label__1	Gossip Girl Boring: I dont get it,this is yet another show of wasted film.What is going on, rich kids, blah.INSTANT STAR on CTV Programming is not.Check INSTANT STAR out on the youtube.If you dont know about INSTANT STAR or Tommy & Jude maybe you should.
__label__1	Never received my item: I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. They took my money and I still have received my item, money back, or feedback after emailing them nearly two weeks ago. I'm not ordering from them again.
__label__2	Pretty good: I'm a coming-of-age genre fan, so Gossip Girl is right up my alley. The season started a little slowly, but it picked up pace toward the end. Mostly it was the same-old, same-old, just with grown-up clothing and with more serious consequences for actions. Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3.
__label__1	The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show.: Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show. Seriously, how many times can Chuck and Blair get back together or a better question would be why s Michelle Tratchenberg returning at the end of every season?
__label__2	RUh-Ruh-Ruh-roofis!!!!: Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!
__label__1	Very disappointed: I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
__label__1	UNDELIVERY: I've already complained twice because I've bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I've never received it. As I've never got a answer, I'm writting this comment. WhAT shoud I do? I'm waiting for so many months and no answer and no product
__label__1	Don't use this company never got item: This company sucks. It's been a lil over a month and never received item. I never got response back from the company after I emailed the 4+ times. I'm also dissatisfied with Amazon and will never use them as well. All I've gotten is the run around. I want my money back so I can go on my way
__label__2	Love GG: I'm a big Gossip Girl fan and thought season 3 was great! Loved seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6! 4 and 5 were okay. ;)
__label__2	A change in attitude: For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Through this book I realized a good astrology reading is made up of the astrologer, the client, and astrology concepts. Astrology can not be tested or practiced as the machine of destiny: if you have X in Y you will be such and such.
__label__1	"Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
__label__1	Not Good Enough: I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well.
__label__1	"The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
__label__2	Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags.: I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
__label__1	Not Worth the Trouble: You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest.
__label__1	Tuner doesn't work well after 1 yr.: I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.
__label__1	This card is terrible: I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it.
__label__2	Exelente eleccion: Los mejores zapatos de futbol que he comprado en mi vida, funcionan perfecto para cesped artifical, cesped natural y piso duro.Lo recomiendo 100%
__label__1	Poor Quality: I bought several of these for my daughters hoping that they would be like the one that I have used for the past 40 years. The design is the same, but the quality was terrible....way to flimsy, they didn't hold their shape (spring) for more than 5 minutes of use. I am greatly disappointed.
__label__2	One of a kind: This is the most detailed bobble head I've ever seen. Its heavy, sturdy, all handpainted clothing, inscriptions on each pant leg, straight thizzface. I got one of the new Andre Macassi bobble heads and its a piece of crap compared to this one, which is why I'm guessing the Thizzelle Washington one was a limited edition of only 5000 handmade. Bummed these are sold out now, I need another one for my gameroom!!
__label__1	"Terrible single: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
__label__2	Wonderful work by a lesser known composer: Edward German's music evokes images of idyllic days in the English countryside. His works are not as well known as those of other English composers from the early 20th Century but you won't be disappointed if you are looking for music that raises the spirit and soothes the soul.
__label__2	great book: i was having trouble in school and my mom gave me this book. it saved me, it is easy to read and really makes sense. i'd reccomend it to anyone having any trouble at all in high school
__label__1	Conventional Wisdom for Morons: This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain.
__label__2	Excellent: I found this book as well as Vaultreports very helpful for anyone hoping to succeed at shifting jobs or careers.
__label__2	Rites of Passage: For great advice on what to expect when you work with a executive recuiter read chapters 7-10. Its worth the price of the book alone. Out of work high-level executives and those who want to make a solid change in their career need to read this book in order to sound smart and learn what to expect from good and bad headhunters.
__label__2	You can't simply read the book, you have to use this workbook.: I read the book and loved it. When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms. Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store. But I was wrong. This book is really two books. The work book is designed to be cut into two different books. One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign. The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook. And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort. The rewards are great. This is a dynimite combination. He is really something else. I recommend this book very highly.
__label__2	When you need orgainzation, this really helps: The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process.
__label__1	"Do NOT buy this burner!: I ended up w/ this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD, which went toes up after about a month. Less than a year later, I have a completely useless burner that stalls at 6% and then freezes my entire system. After NUMEROUS emails and phone calls to TDK, I finally got ""authorization"" to send it in for replacement. I am so fed up, I am going to buy a Lite-On and wash my hands of it.Look elsewhere....this burner is not work the carboard box it is packaged in."
__label__2	Kyra's Story: This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!
__label__2	nakita's review: i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it.
__label__1	another nickelodeon knock off: this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games; bad graphics, too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first. just as i did with 5 nickelodeon game boy games that were way overpriced. please dont be as stupid as i was...i suggest you DO NOT buy it.
__label__2	Great First Game!!!: I bought this game at Best Buy and am glad I did! This game has good levels which are FUN games! I do think they need to add a couple more! Although it may look as though there is only multiplayer, there is a single game. One game which you squirt other players is REALLY hard to control! I don't think you are supposed to control the people! The level is really fun though. When you choose a player(s) the game chooses the other people you are playing against. The sound is really hard to hear but not bad if you turn up the volume. The graphics are okay. All and all I think this is a pretty good game!
__label__1	Save your money: If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good, doesn't mean the game is.My 6 year-old doesn't like it.
__label__1	How to raise the stress level in your house?-Buy Party Blast: This game is a piece of .... The system requirements on the box are misleading. It is tough to explain to a six year old that his brand new game can't be played until you upgrade your video card, even though no reference was made to it on the box.And when the game finally works it looks like a hybrid of 2000 technology meets 1977 graphics.
__label__1	"Not worth your money: This game is ridiculously hard for a game with ""Nickelodeon"" on it. I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play. Spongebob and Tommy let us down. Hard. Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money. I won't be taken in by the ""Nickelodeon"" name again."
__label__1	Pretty bad: This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak.
__label__1	TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT: I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!
__label__1	Not what I expected: I was excited when I first saw this game. We are always looking for a game for our young children to play. There it just not enough games for young children on x-box. This game was a big disappointment! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing. There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player. It just was NOT FUN!
__label__1	Not good: This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. It has horrible graphics and I don't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all.
__label__1	Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics: We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.
__label__1	Not what I expected.: Not what I expected. Too much acting. Disappointing to say the least. I will not buy the like again. Oh well.
__label__1	Please don't buy this globe.: E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
__label__2	Woo-Hoo!!!: The Christmas episodes are always the best. . .I have the other DVD of Christmas episodes of The Simpsons, and I love it! The Christmas episodes are the only ones I want to own on DVD, but it is nice having the other winter-themed episodes on the DVD along with the holiday episodes. I'm glad I don't have to spend $40 on a whole season of The Simpsons just for the one Christmas episode I want. I wish more tv shows had Christmas-only DVDs available.
__label__1	Love the Simpsons, but this ain't Christmas.: Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here.
__label__1	Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included.
__label__2	the simpsons christmas 2: I love this dvd. The reason why I gave it a 4 is because in tis the 15th season, right at the end of act 2 my dvd skips to the end credits. Has any one else seen this problem?
__label__2	Kinder But Less Impressive than Joshua: I read the first Joshua book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools. Overall this was a good book.
__label__2	Joshua is a truely the most movig and inspiring I ever read: I'm not very old ut I think that this is by fare the best book I ever read.
__label__2	joshua and the children: This was a wonderful and inspiring story. Words truly can strengthen our spirit. This book was filled with many heart warming words and important messages that can help in our daily living.
__label__2	The story was very interesting and the book worth reading.: I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest. The one thing I did not like about the book was the counties that were mentioned are not counties of West Virginia. I am from WV. Charleston and Huntington were mentioned though which is accurage.
__label__2	Chunky gamelan: Brassy, spectral percussion.Stark, intimate and boldly intense. Blooms of bicycle bell, musical box and every manner of metal chime, grungily recorded in an up close and personal fashion. Strange and indulgent, reveling in the sensuality of its own clank, scrack and visceral punch.For all it's minimalism this heady music is perfumed and exotic, richly harmonious and rippling with pulsating rhythm. Almost ecstatic, like medieval religious music.
__label__1	"A disappointment: Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
__label__2	Lots of up-to-date knots: It includes lots of up-to-date knots. You can find the knots you want in a easy way. Also, the knots are categorized by the uses of them by which you can find the common usage of those knots. Easy to use.
__label__1	Its Blaaaaaaa: Its full of pitures and not what I thought it would of been. There are better books then this one I would pass it up if I had known.
__label__2	Really usable: With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage. It is profusely illustrated with clear, easy-to-read photographs, and has easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. Covering everything from the most basic to the decorative, with suggestions for the use of each, it would be a practical and beautiful assistance for anyone who has always wanted to know how to tie those nifty knots.
__label__2	This is a great book.: I just recently got into tying knots. This is a great book; the pictures are great and it gives good info to boot. I would recommend this book to anyone.
__label__2	"Great book. Informative and well written.: Sometimes you need to ""tie the right knot"" at the right time, and this book helps a lot! Sometimes you need to tie two different size ropes together; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you keen a knot that will slip; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you need a knot that does not slip; this book has a knot for that too! And what if you need to hang up / organize your extension cords...? Use the Fireman's Coil knot! Great book. Lots of color photos taken at each step."
__label__2	Good Results: I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster
__label__2	Wonderful: The story is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Sadly, the author passed away on October 8, 2002, so there won't be any more in the series.
__label__1	"Cups are too thick and molded: The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."
__label__1	Too small: It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered! So they run a lot smaller. It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling.
__label__1	Cone Boobs: I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive.
__label__2	"Nice Look, Not A Great Fit!: I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit. Sorry I can't say the same about the Carina bra.I agree with a previous reviewer, the cup size is off, not true to size and that results in ""spillage"". I bought the 40G, the straps are pretty and the lower back fits just perfect. The only con is the cup size, recommend ordering ""up"" one cup size when purchasing this particular bra."
__label__1	Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support: The elastic used for the band very easily loses it's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). For a molded style, this bra loses it's use after a week. It's pretty but poorly engineered.
__label__2	Sizing a little off..: I love the shaping this bra gives, but the straps sometimes pop out when I'm putting it on -- so annoying. It's also cut a little smaller than other Le Mystere bras in the band and the cup (think spillage). Otherwise, it's great and much better than any other convertible bra I've EVER tried!
__label__2	Perfect Basic Bra: This bra is comfortable and creates a smooth silhouette under all kinds of clothes. It runs slightly small in the band, as usual in this brand, but the cup fits true to size.
__label__1	Awful fit: I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
__label__2	Nothing compares to Le Mystere bras: During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra.
__label__2	My son loves this game!: I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!
__label__1	Probably for Little Little Kids Only: Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)
__label__1	Doesn't lock well: The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured.
__label__2	"Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
__label__2	I love this little guy!: I already had a larger combo square which I used like crazy, but for many applications having a smaller square is easier to use. I use it for marking board edges, for making sure my chisels and plane irons are square when sharpening them.... great buy for the price.
__label__2	"Wonderful, inspirational, well done: I first saw this video 15 years ago when I was going through a transition phase of my life which started as a result of an injury. As I was just starting to push through the ""doom and gloom"" and take on new challenges, I found this video by chance. I was powerfully affected by its imagery and message. I watched it over and over, and really clicked with the symbol and image of the magestic bald eagle. To this day, the Eagle evokes in me an image of character, perserverence, courage, fortitude, strength and nobility that I aspire to in my life's roles. This video wonderfully depicts these timeless, universal themes that add purpose and meaning to our lives. I have shared this video with many through the years. I find that most people are ""wowed"" by it, and inspired to different degrees depending upon where they are in their own life journey."
__label__1	Terrible motivational film: If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down.
__label__1	Choices in Relationships: I requested the book 9th edition and you sent me a student review 4th edition. This is an activity manuel to accompany the book.
__label__1	Badly Written and Boring: Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. A group of eighth graders could have written something better.The dialog is just plain stupid. I understand that the writer of this movie has gone back to working for a lawn maintenance company, and is given nothing more complicated than trimming shrubs.
__label__2	Good replacement: Great product is exactly what it says. Good replacement for my mirror which was broken. It is slightly different on the inside but the exterior, after installation, is unnoticeable.
__label__2	Beautiful, high quality necklace!: This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!
__label__1	Plagued with problems: I bought a Radeon 8500 to replace my Radeon 7000. When I first installed it the performance and frame rate just blew me away. But then I found out that my card has problems running games and 3d apps. I got a headache from trying to fix it and I'm going to have to send it back to ATI for a replacement.
__label__1	Causes computer to reboot: This card was big disappointment. I am using it on a dual Athlon MP system with Windows XP Pro. I have had repeated problems with the card causing my system to spontaneouesly reboot. Trying to play live video on a media player such as Windows Media Player or RealPlayer seems to be a particular problem. Applying repeated driver updates from ATI has not helped. The card is very fast, but the system stability issues are driving me crazy and have caused me to remove it from my computer. With a different card my system works great. I have have had good experiences with other ATI cards, but this card (or its drivers) are unstable.
__label__2	great graphics for the money: great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go.
__label__2	nice work ATI: ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card).
__label__2	Radeon 8500 second chance: Well my previous review for this card was not good. But I just built a new, faster computer and put the Radeon to the test again. My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also. Worth the money-now that is.
__label__2	"Never cease to AMAZE me: OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh!

Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
__label__1	"Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between: When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
__label__1	Cheesy, boring, move on......: I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog.
__label__1	Very poor story: The only good thing about this movie are the special effects. The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)
__label__1	A Lame Ghost Wannabe: Very sad. If you must, rent the ORIGINAL Haunting--a very good flick. This film suffers from the Hollywood mentality: that special effects and big name actors can rescue a weak plot. Was there a single scare in the film? No. Was the ending telegraphed right from the start? Yes. CGI spirits do not make for chills.
__label__1	possibly the worst haunted house movie made: This movie doesn't scare, it barely entertains and is frustrating to watch capable actors (Zita Jones and Nelson) in limited roles.The script is just plan bad, instead of showing realistic traditional ghost the producer decided to go with high dollar unrealistic special effects that are way overdone.I didn't hate the movie, but I was really disapointed.
__label__1	"About as scary as a "" Facts of Life "" reunion special: The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
__label__1	One terrible movie!: My girlfriend and I went to see The Haunting and almost walked out. I jumped once in the whole movie. It was slow, the acting was not very good. Do not waste your time with this one! I would have given this 0 stars but they did not have that option. BORED TO DEATH!
__label__2	"One of the most scariest movies I have ever seen!: This movie has got to been one of the best horror movies I have seen in years. This movie made me so scared, when we saw it in the movie theater, I screamed out ""Oh, my god!"" at one scene of the movie! This movie is a thriller."
__label__1	"Poopy!: Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
__label__2	i liked Owen Wilsons part. IT was a suprising film that will: This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare.
__label__1	"Things go ""DUD"" in the night: Once again a remake takes a ""Classic"" film ""The Haunting""(the best haunted house movie ever) and retooled it as an effects driven mess. Did they even watch the original or read the wonderful novel? Surely not if this is what they came up with. All the subtler aspects of the first are thrown out in favor of the mind numbing CGI effects. The result is one big dud of a ""thriller"". The cast is good but wasted as the makers seem more intent on showing us what they can do with CGI rather than giving us a true ""chiller"" like the better than ever original was.All in all, not even a nice try!!!"
__label__1	WHY ?: Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot.
__label__1	Not scary at all!: The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else.
__label__2	The Haunting: I thought this was a great movie. Fine, so the story was average, but the fantastic effects and even better sound more than made up for it. I would recommend this film to anyone with a dolby digital setup, just sit back and feel the room shake!
__label__2	"A True ""Thriller""!: While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its ""Thriller"" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old ""haunted house"". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park ""fun house"" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind."
__label__1	"the real horror in this horror movie: When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another ""tech show""."
__label__1	Slept like a baby...: I watched this flick at 1 a.m. Afterwards, I had no trouble falling asleep. When is Hollywood going to realize that showing too much emphasis on visuals makes bad theater? Overdone, bombastic,predictable,CGI effects. The house looked too much like a gaudy museum with ridiculous fixtures. On the positive side,though, the sound effects were great. The bass notes were very well done, subtle shades of ghostly children whispering and eerie creaky sounds throughout the house were the real jewel in this film.
__label__1	A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative.
__label__1	I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie: This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic.
__label__1	"Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else: Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled ""The Haunting of Hill House""), Jan De Bont's brainless thriller ""The Haunting"" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the story and logic went. The film's razzle-dazzle visuals make it somewhat fun, but it's unescapably a downer."
__label__1	ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER: THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
__label__2	Pretty Good Flick: Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less.
__label__1	"Ehhh , nice visuals?: I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
__label__1	Ultimately, this one's a failure (though not without merit).: Four people are placed in a gigantic mansion as part of a study in fear, but they don't realize the house is actually haunted. Effects-heavy thriller features a decent beginning and a so-so cast (Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fine, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor are spectacularly awful), but eventually falls apart in the last half-hour, with a barrage of cheesy special effects taking over. Add to that the predictability and the sappy conclusion and you have a movie that went from promising to big dud. It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting).
__label__1	Numbingly bad.: Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture.
__label__1	One of the worst of 99...: Question: How do you take an excellent cast, millions of dollars, top of the line FX, base it on a good movie only toturn it into a piece of unwatchable garbage? Answer: Let Jan de Bont direct it.
__label__2	Awesome Movie!: I went to a sneak preview of this movie when itcame out last July and I loved it! I read the book before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the book and the movie are not really that similiar. I loved this movie because I love haunting movies, scary stuff that makes the audience scream. This one does it, though at the end it is a little far fetched I have to admit, but overall I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting leaves something to be desired on many occasions, however, but a movie like this you don't go to see because of the acting. Four Out Of Five.
__label__1	Bad horror movie: The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier.Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only acting poorly, she is also a complete misfit in this movie. It's as if she has just been asked to be in The Haunting because the makers want some chick on the screen. But you don't even see any of her sexiness in this movie.Furthermore, there are several ridiculous movie mistakes in The Haunting.There are a few relatively scary scenes and even some good laughs here and there. Apart from that, only Lily Taylor's acting is worth mentioning.
__label__1	Writer and director witoout souls: I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
__label__1	Wow, What a Disappointment: It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this.
__label__2	Great Movie: I seen this movie too many times to get scared. But I enjoy it each time. I also enjoy watching the special features. The house that they filmed this movie in was really haunted. The movie crew kept seeing, feeling, and hearing things. They also talked about different haunted places in the special features. If you are into haunted movie's you don't want to pass this movie up.
__label__1	Promises alot. Delivers little.: I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down.
__label__1	Microwaved horror: Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother.
__label__1	"Unbelievably Putrid: Stay away from this putrid piece of decaying mouse droppings! This is just another fine example of taking a large budget film and creating various computer generated images which look ""COOL"" and write some dialogue and a very weak story line around it. When will people stop being oohed and awed by special effects and appreciate writing content of a movie? The old Julie Harris movie is so superior, see it! You will see what a good movie is! Why remake some a classic with some screenwriter first credit for a movie. I feel the writer rented 20 horror movies, sat and watched them and took notes. ""Hey I like that and that."" If this film comes anywhere near you, use a crucifix or holy water, anything to save 2 hours of your life!"
__label__1	"NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE.: This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
__label__1	CGI no substitute for story: This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Might have worked as an original idea, but being a re-make of a classic movie, itself based on a classic novel, necessitates living up to the original, which this movie did not.
__label__1	Just skip it.: 1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time.
__label__2	"Entertaining and Effective: I understand that this was based on the classic book by Shirley Jackson's "" The Haunting of Hill House"" which is an excellent book. May I suggest that those who love ghost stories read Shirley's Book. The original Movie titled ""The Haunting"" that was released in the early '60's, stared Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It was done in black and white and was very effective for it's time in moving it's audience. I highly recommend seeing this version also. Now, this new updated version has hit the screen with great effects, great scenery and vivid color for the modern era. Yes, it to stands alone and is very effective for it's time. I don't feel any of the three medias should be compared. They all stand alone on their own and all should be enjoyed. So I highly recommend that if one enjoys chills up one's spine, they should go out and rent or buy all three versions and enjoy one wonderful experience after another."
__label__2	Two Thumbs Up: I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.
__label__1	Not Oscar Material: Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those.
__label__1	"This movie insulted my intelligence...: along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
__label__2	GREAT MOVIE: THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME ALOT OF THE ACTORS ARE YOUNG, I LOVED THE EFFECTS, FOR A OLDER MOVIE IT HAD SOME AWESOME UPGRADES. I AM SO GLAD I OWN IT.
__label__1	Truly disappointing: This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful.
__label__1	"Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive ""b"" movie??: OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT remake great movies if you cannot do any even better job of telling the story! Its a waste and an annoyance!"
__label__1	Watch the original instead: Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier.
__label__1	Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost movies about them): Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here. This movie was the pits.
__label__1	"Must I even give it one star?: Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
__label__1	THE HAUNTING: ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW. THE NEW DEPENDS ON COMPUTER EFFECTS. WHICH WERE PRETTY COOL. BUT DID NOT SAVE THE MOVIE FROM ITS DOWNFALL. ITS LACK OF STORY WAS LAME.NOT SCARY WHAT SO EVER. SEE THE ORIGINAL. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
__label__1	"The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones: I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."
__label__1	The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through...: It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie.
__label__1	This is not a horror movie.: This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense.
__label__1	Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch: I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald's for the rest of their lives. This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video. If you want to see a classic haunted house story and be scared, then get the original movie with Claire Bloom.
__label__2	A funhouse of special effects.: This DVD has superior picture than the video version. Its a good film of effects and the audio is far superior on DVD. I thought it sounded smooth and clear and dialog is easily heard. Hugh Crane haunted the house with spookier sounds that were unnoticed on video or in most theaters. I love films, but I am not that picky on the tech spects, but if you want to own this film, get DVD. It rules, and its easy to use for anyone who likes movies.
__label__2	A Children Horror Movie: It's a pretty good movie ! It's more a kids movie, a kids horror movie, those children who Eleanor must save. My 9 year old sister watched it either and she likes the movie either. The ending whas a little weak but overall it's great. Rating: 8,5 of 10
__label__2	"Welcome Home Eleanor: Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)went to the haunted ""Hill House"" together with three other People, included Eleanor (Lilly Taylor), a bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). Everything seemes harmless... at the beginning of course. But it isn't! Strange things happening to the Guests of the ""Hill House""! Children are talking to them, Statues are moving and bloody footprint are leading them to mysterious places! All this is happening most of all to Eleanor. She is seeing things. Things that nobody else cans see...This is a hillerious Ghost-Story with breathtaking Special Effects and a just perfect ""Hill House""!!!Buy this DVD but beware: ""Everyone lives in Town three Miles away from here. Everyone leaves before Dark. Nobody will come any nearer than that, in the night, in the dark..."""
__label__1	Expected More: I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you.
__label__1	The Haunting is just... bad.: If you want a good haunted house flick, get something else... anything else. This film has a pretty set, but no character development, no suspense, no scares, and no point.
__label__1	"Two hours I'll never get back!: When I heard they were remaking ""The Haunting,"" I was excited. I love the original movie. I thought that with the modern techniques we have, we could make a good movie better.I was wrong. Sitting through this stinker was torture. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that's similar to Shirley Jackson's novel and the original movie is the name. Want to do something fun? Go get a root canal. It would be a lot more fun than this movie."
__label__1	Worst movie I've ever seen: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the classic 1963 version. Not to mention the worst ending I have ever seen. The only things this movie has going for it are the special effects and the house itself even though the house in the 1963 version looked a lot scarier and more sufficating, like it was truely alive. If you get any movie get the original The Haunting.
__label__1	"Really boring: This is probably the worst ""horror"" movie I have ever seen! Don't see this unless you want to be bored to death!"
__label__1	Boring, not scary: This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it.
__label__1	"It had a lot of potential: If this movie had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. ""I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine! Go to hell!"""
__label__1	"good special effects, but no plot: To think of the courage it took hollywood to actualy claim that this was taken from Jackson's book ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is amazing. I am a big fan of the book and I'm just writing to tell that there is little simularity's between the movie and the book. Only the names are the same and 1 five minute scene is taken from the book. The rest is from the imagination of the screenwriter. I would think that if you are going to change that much of a plot, then you shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as from the book. However, the special effects are amazing, the acting is well done. They should have put another title to it and changed the names of the charecters. Then it could have been there own work. Very disapointing."
__label__1	Good special effects, lame otherwise: The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)
__label__1	"Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."
__label__1	INSOMNIA CURE! WATCH THIS MOVIE!: THE MOVIE TAKES SO LONG TO GET INTERESTING YOUR ASLEEP BEFOREYOU KNOW IT.THANK GOD I RENTED THIS!
__label__1	Too Long To Get To The Point: This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
__label__1	OH MY GOD: Though I have a suspicion that this movie will soon become a cult favorite, currently, it is simply one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror movies ever made. The elements -- including the cast, from a pouting, bi-sexual Catherine Zeta-Jones to an achingly sincere Lillian Taylor, and the plot, which takes a classic Shirley Jackson story and actually takes away the terror -- are each so bad that the end result is one of those movies you watch and say -- how did this ever get made? Redeeming qualities: the set, which is so massive and full of detail that it is interesting to explore, and a few of the special effects, which unfortunately do not help you to understand the absurdly diluted-and-then-regurgitated plot. There could have been a great horror movie from that story, but this is definitely not it.
__label__1	Just terrible: No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period.
__label__1	Absolutely horrible: Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store.
__label__2	"This is a must see for anyone who likes haunted houses.: This is one movie I would watch over and over again. The story is great. the suspense is great without alot of blood and guts. As it says in the movie"" makes a great bedtime story""."
__label__1	Huge talents in a poor poor movie: Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie.
__label__1	I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back: If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?
__label__1	Very sorry indeed.: Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money...
__label__1	Typical Hollywood Bull Sh*t: What you would expect from a hollywood production. If you LOVE Hollywood, you'll LOVE this, otherwise go check out something that is actually freaky, I.E. The Changling or Suspiria.
__label__1	Please don't even bother with this one: I saw the original movie made in 1963 and it was wonderful. I was very anxious for this remake to come out and man was I disappointed!! It was horrible!
__label__1	Dismal: I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece.
__label__1	About as scary as The Simpsons!: I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!
__label__1	what a joke: this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?
__label__1	TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING: It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!
__label__1	Don't waste your time, money, energy on this stinker!: I didn't realize this movie was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!
__label__1	Try something else.: I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there.
__label__1	"Not for Shirley Jackson fans: This remake supposedly is based on ""The Haunting of Hill House"" by Shirley Jackson, but there is actually very little of her original novel in this version. In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it's an insult to say it's based on her work.The first film from the 1960's is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it's so scary.In this new ""version,"" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh! And the way it ends is just totally not right! Read the book! See the first version on film! Avoid this new one like the plague.(It's telling -- as of the today, the DVD of the remake is selling for less than the DVD of the first film!)"
__label__1	This movie stinks!: This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!
__label__1	Disgrace: Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see.
__label__1	this movie sucks!: This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame.
__label__2	Creepy: Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film.....however I must admit that the atmosphere of the orginal has been reproduced by some great effect and some superb camera work. The actors perform quite well, however they do tend to play second fiddle to the effects - and more importantly the house itself (which is breath-taking). As the film progresses the feeling of dread builds to a good climax, which is slighly more upbeat than that of the original! Nevertheless this film does not deserve the slagging it got in the press and does well to keep up with the black & white version.
__label__2	"Not that bad after all: Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
__label__1	ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE: How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made. Get the original 1963 version or read the classic novel--BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE!
__label__1	Hollywood has run out of ideas......: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!
__label__1	"The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted: a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
__label__1	"A waste of time and money: Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
__label__1	Worst Movie Ever Made: If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along. Very little care was paid to the story when bringing this film to the screen. The only care seems to have been for the special effects. I want my two hours back.
__label__1	"TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR: ""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
__label__1	"Got Carried Away with Special Effects: I thought this movie was really cheesy. It got so carried away with the special effects, that there wasn't enough room for a real story. This new version of ""The Haunting"" was terrible, and it could have been a whole lot better. I don't reccomend this film to anyone who has seen the original, they would be very dissapointed and frustrated."
__label__1	Go Haunt Yourself!: This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10.
__label__1	"99.9 FAILURE!: The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
__label__1	Some movies are just born bad...: To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told.
__label__1	"Terrible...!: Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch ""The House On Haunted Hill"" (1999) or ""Thir13een Ghosts"" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"
__label__1	Worst Film Ever Made, ever!: It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!
__label__1	Read the Book: What made the book horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters.The ending was completely destroyed. The writers/director/producer should have stuck closer to the original story and this would have been a much better movie: a classic.C'est la vie.
__label__1	"A very poorly done horror movie.: A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
__label__1	Big Thumb's Down!: Lousy, poorly adapted film that takes an excellent book and tacks on the lamest, un-scariest, unneeded Hollywood ending. Why? Just so it could have a happy ending. Terrible! Terible!
__label__1	Come on!: This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible.
__label__1	"Boredom personified!: This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
__label__2	Terrific!: This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. This flick was truly watchable and enjoyable. It will have you glued to your screen! If you love scary movies, don't pass up this one!
__label__2	I like it.: I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie.
__label__1	Terrible: To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
__label__1	Wish I could give it 0 stars: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks.
__label__1	Worst possible remake: I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house.
__label__1	A waste of valuable money!: I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price.
__label__1	Tell me a story: This film suffers greatly from having nothing at all to say. The set was grand, but the script was lacking and the actors had nothing to do but make it through to their paychecks. Don't waste your time.
__label__1	Mediocre horror movie: I guess the special effects were OK.... Frankly, however, this was kinda a big disappointment - with fine actors like Neeson and Zeta-Jones you'd expect more. Rather give this one a skip and go watch the 'Scream' movies all over again.....
__label__1	not bad!: My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this movie but you might find it boring a bit.I dont recommend this to people who enjoy movies that have a good story and directing.
__label__1	okay movie with a couple scary parts: You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this.
__label__1	"Please!: This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
__label__1	"poor remake: Whoever made this misunderstood the word `scary', special effects make you go ""wow"" not ""aarrgghh! ""Look to the original version."
__label__1	A BAD VERSION OF THE HAUNTING!!!: This was a bad remake of a really original SCARY movie. This remake focuses on the children trapped in the house. The original movie focused on the house and how scary and evil it was. That was what made it scary. The Haunting remake has ok special effects but some were not needed. Whoever reads this review I don't really recommend this movie but if you want to waste a couple of bucks go ahead.
__label__1	there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty.
__label__1	skip the movie: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello.
__label__1	"AWFUL!: I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
__label__1	Sue me: I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?
__label__2	"Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!: The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
__label__1	What unmitigated....: CRAP!The original Haunting from 1963 has long long been my favourite ghost story....So I was excited tho needless very apprehensive about this remake. Somehow I knew modern Hollywood would mess it completely up. And they did not disappoint me.Completely changed the whole background and story line. Instead of the subtle and eerie horror...you get the gore and obvious.Don't waste any time on this junk. Of course if you are like the majority of clueless americans...this might be right up your alley.
__label__1	Not frightening, not anything: There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student.
__label__2	The Haunting: Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film.
__label__1	there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat.

__label__1	Oh no,: It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either.
__label__1	horribly......stupid: Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing.
__label__2	Extremely interesting and exciting! A real QUEST!: Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action. It is not an ordinary scary movie or thriller - definitely, it is more... Try it and I think you won't be disappointed at all.
__label__2	"One of the best ""Haunted House"" movies I've ever seen!!: I bought this movie after hearing how creepy it was. I was very surprised how good this movie really was. I really liked the parts with the children calling Elanore to help save them. I am very happy with this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the hottest actor I've ever seen star in a horror movie! This DVD is well worth your movie!:)"
__label__2	WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe.
__label__2	"Best Haunted House CGI I've Seen So Far: I like haunted house movies and this film is no exception. Yes, it is a ""reimaging"" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I'm also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort."
__label__1	in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts: there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original
__label__1	Horrible: And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost story and tried to do something with it.The problem is that they relied way way way too heavily on special effects. Don't believe me? Watch the original. It will have your skin crawling and had very little special effects.Why do they have to try to rework something that is perfect? I don't get it.If Hollywood is going to rework a masterpiece, then play it straight. Just because you can do all sorts of things with special effects doesn't mean you have to try to put them in remakes, especially if the original is perfect!
__label__2	"Pretty scary-not so swift ending: I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
__label__1	"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL: To say that this version of ""The Haunting"" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."
__label__1	"ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM: Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"
__label__2	"Terrific apologetics novel explains Catholicism from Bible: I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the ""Roman"" church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"
__label__2	"A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith: The book ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. And oh, how this is needed in these times of crisis and confusion in church catechesis. A must read for every Catholic of all ages, religious and clergy included, and a great book to share."
__label__2	Dan's Review: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars.
__label__2	Lasalle student's book review: I enjoyed this book very much, to my suprise. When my teacher assigned this book, I thought that I would be bored throughout of the whole book. I did not think that i would be to interested in a book about church and Fundamentalism, but as I got into the book I really started to enjoy it. I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better. All of the information about Catholic religion and why mary and peter are respected in the church. This book gave me a great experience in learning things about my Catholic faith that i never thought i would learn. I am glad my teacher gave me this assignment.
__label__2	Stephen Dwyer: A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.
__label__2	"Review For Mr. Puntel: Having read ""A Philadelphia Catholic In King James' Court"" I received a better picture of the Catholic Church. I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."
__label__2	"An online review!: This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the ""conflict"" that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the ""questioning"" and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."
__label__1	APCIKJC by White: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected.
__label__1	Untitled: This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written.
__label__1	PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam: This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book.
__label__2	Religion Review - LSCHS Student: After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass.
__label__2	Mr. Puntels Class: The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it.
__label__2	The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views: Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story.
__label__2	Erik Haney Book Reveiw: I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a very good book. It was very well written and had a good plot. It is the first ever apologetic novel, and it has done a good job in clearing the way for others. In this book, there were many good discussions on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. My favorite parts in the book were whenever, Michael was in the Bible study sessions, and these chapters were very exciting. In the book, there were many good characters that really helped to make this book a lot more interesting for the reader. I especially liked that Michael succeeded in bible study and convinced hid cousin Eli, through his teachings and discussions of the Catholic Church. I thought that the story was well written, and I would love to read a sequel.
__label__2	Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars.
__label__1	"Misleading entities...: While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."
__label__2	"A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish: Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
__label__2	"Urban Bushmen: The Art Ensemble in top form: Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. The AEC's trademark percussion ensembles, jocular takes on marching music, etc., are surrounded by inspired playing. ""New York is full of lonely people"" is one of Lester Bowie's most enduring and beautiful melodies. Long enough to allow the group to do its characteristic stretching of time on long improvs, this is still, in my view, an accessible record. A great place to start exploring the music of the full quintet version of the band, along with their other ECM albums, and a pair of their live sets from early 70's."
__label__1	Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0: This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information.
__label__1	Not very useful: As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book).
__label__1	sound quality ??????: the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
__label__2	Looks good, but not for mobile applications.: I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car. It is small, rugged, and runs on 12 volts. I contacted RF Link and they even sent me a unit to try out, along with their amplifier, so that definitely says good things about them. Unfortunately, it did not work at all for me. As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around.
__label__1	Not as advertised: The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
__label__1	zero customer service: I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase.
__label__1	"Unfortunate Waste of Money: It's a great concept.... connecting A/V devices over a short distance without wires. However, the Rf Link system doesn't quite make it a reality. I tried very hard to use the system to connect a camcorder to a TV/monitor. Even at a very short distance of 10 feet, the signal continously drops. I even tried adding the ""optional"" Rf Link output booster. However, any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver (still at 10 feet) causes the signal to drop out.... totally unacceptable and unusable. The only happy note was Amazon's great customer service and return policy."
__label__2	Ralph does it again!!: My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!
__label__2	"Soon to be your kid's favorite: As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
__label__1	I'd like to see Ralph at the bottom of the sea: Covert writes a bunch of non-sensical, sophomoric songs that my kids simply hate. This guy is a Barney-wannabe and this album does nothing to save his dignity.
__label__2	"ten stars wouldn't be enough!: What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Well-crafted songs with clever lyrics and talented musicianship make for a 50-minute delight. ""At the Bottom of the Sea"" has clever word-play, ""Surfin' in My Imagination"" has some fine surf guitar and inspires some uninhibited dancing, and a great rendition of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" should have you singing in no time with your child. Each song is worth hearing over and over (and over), and this CD is money well spent. My son laughs and laughs at Eighteen Wheels on a Big Rig,"" and I am partial to and extremely appreciative of ""The Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song)."" After all, four bananas make a bunch and so do many more!I am incredibly impressed with Ralph Covert's abilities to reach a child's imagination without shutting out the adults. I am going to buy this as a gift to all parents I know, and I also plan to purchase Ralph's World's first CD. This CD should be at the top of anyone's Wish List."
__label__2	Kelly Jumped Into Our Family!: My daughter is 3 and she loves all of the Barbie items but they are still sometimes too big and hard for her to play with. I finally convinced her to try out Barbie's sister Kelly with this Jumpin Castle playset and she loves it. The playset was not hard to put together - it only took me about 5 minutes. The only thing that did not impress me with the toy is the cardboard cutouts in the box that you fold up to be presents for Kelly. We just tossed those but the toy itself is great and is teaching my daughter how to pretend play.
__label__2	Fun for a while...: We bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday & she really loved it at first. She especially liked it when her older cousin showed her that she could put other small toys in the castle & pop them out and across the room. However, she lost interest soon after & I haven't seen her play with it in the 3 months since her birthday.
__label__1	like the doll, but that's it: Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and, in the long run, my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll, I wouldn't recommend this one, just a waste of plastic here.
__label__2	cabin-worthy: Live in New Mexico and have a summer mountain cabin at 8500 ft in Cloudcroft--brrr. Usually 15-20 at night in January. No other heat source. Got the new Dyna-Glo 23,000 BTU Portable Kerosene Convection Heater up there yesterday at 130 PM and it was 30F in the cabin. it has a 400 sq ft main room and a 280 sq ft upper sleeping quarters. Temp went up to 40 in 1 hr; 50 in 2hrs; and it was 65 in 4 hrs. It was 72 degrees at bedtime, 1030PM, and I filled the tank and went upstairs where it was 58 degrees. Put a CO monitor at the stairwell to go off so I wouldnt die of CO poisoning in my sleep. It never went off. By morning, it was 61 upstairs, and 80 in the main room. The full tank had gone down by just over 1/2 by 7AM. No stink at all and I am sensitive to that. Had to shut it off to cool it down in there for morning coffee! The low outdoor temp only got to 28F, so not sure how it would do in lower temps....will update if/when we try it. GOOD heater, albeit a little slow to get there.
__label__2	Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain.
__label__2	Doolittle is Doing a LOT!: First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother? Because Jerome Doolittle's Body Scissor's is worth the read and the write. If you enjoy Crais, Parker et al, you will enjoy Jerome's style as well. Tom Bethany is just the guy I'd like to be--if I were a guy. :-) Read his earlier works- grow with his characters.
__label__1	First Part: I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update.
__label__1	"This book make my feel bad for a moment and some tests in end have suggestions for buy more book from same publisher: As I see that, book have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of book, only comments like something as ""If you not understand it now, after all what you read, you need buy ""Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies... etc""- what really agressive advertising, make peoples feel scared, stupid and affraid and make them need buy more books from this publisher...Its scare my for a moment!Most helpful for my Peterson ASVAB, what have good explanation for ALL tests. I never not bui something ""for dummies"" again."
__label__1	not what people think: this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned. Im sure there are better ways to improve your math skills. don't waste your money.
__label__2	asvab for dummies: great book..i have learned a lot!! i recommend this book for anyone who wants to join the military and will soon be faced with taking the ASVAB test.i studied for the math section of the ASVAB and i passed with flying colors
__label__2	Good item, but could it be better: The book is very easy to read and understand, gives very clear explanations, but it could it be great if it included a practice CD like most ASVAB books now come with...
__label__2	Excellent resource: I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information.
__label__2	Very Helpful: This book was very helpful in letting us know about the ASVAB. It showed us how to get a better AFQT score as well as what areas we needed to score higher in to get the job we wanted. It was very easy to use and the practice tests were so helpful. My husband past the test and got the job area he wanted. It also prepared him for what the test day was like and gave him clues on how to stay at ease and help his knowledge be better used. We were in a hurry to study up and it was quick and to the point. I will probably look at other dummies books for other helps.
__label__2	If you want a higher ASVAB score get this book!: I am currently DEPed into the US Navy.Before taking the ASVAB, I took several online practice exams, as well as the first practice exam inside this book. I didn't do too well on certain portions of the exam.Focusing on the things I had trouble on, and brushing up on the rest of the stuff, I studied for about a month.When I went to take my ASVAB for the first time, I did well on every exam, making a 94 AFQT (scored higher than 94% of applicants).I absolutely recommend this book. It provides more knowledge than is needed to pass the test, and keeps things interesting with side-notes, trivia, and funny comments.
__label__2	Good book lots of info: It really is a great book it is full of facts. It helps you solve problems and gives you hints for taking the test, most recruiters recommend this, it is also cheaper on here then that garbage store Barns and Noble.
__label__1	Missing pages.: Contents references pages up to 375. Book stop at page 342. Three chapters are missing. Good book up until the missing chapters.
__label__1	Asvab for Dummies: It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
__label__1	yes and no: I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying.
__label__2	Getting Ready: It arrived in perfect condition and when they said so. Got this for my son, who wants to go into the Marines. He said, it has helped him with the Math since it breaks it down into layman terms and helped him understand the algebra section which he struggles with. So happy they have a book that focused on the test for military. This should give him a leg up on a good score on the test. God bless all our young men and women who give their all for our freedom.
__label__2	great book: i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best
__label__2	Was a gift: The book arrived in great shape and on time. It was a gift, so I'm not sure of anything else related to the contents of the book, or if it was helpful to the person who received it as a gift.
__label__2	easy transaction!: great transaction.. book is as described and was received on time.. at the given price this was a good value!
__label__2	easy to get through!!!: I'm almost looking forward to actually taking the ASVAB after reading through this book- it made everything so easy, even the sections I don't need to excel in! Very clear, and the author is personable enough to make you feel comfortable while learning...
__label__2	Great book, very complete!: My husband said this book was excellent, its really helping him study for the ASVAB, he hasnt taken it yet so we dont know what his score will be but he studies everyday using this book.
__label__1	"Few Errors: If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
__label__2	Great book: This book was wonderful. My son needed it to improve his ASVAB score and it worked really well for us. He did score higher, a lot higher than his orginal score and we were both please with the results. I would recommend this to anyone attempting to take the ASVAB. You will reap the benefits if you read and study the book.
__label__2	Great study guide!!!: I studied my butt off with the help of this book. The practice tests in this book were actually harder than the real ASVAB! That helped me be even more prepared. I only missed 5 questions on the ASVAB! NO LIE! Study this book for about 3 weeks and take it seriously. You will see your scores improve!!!
__label__1	incorrect practice test answers: I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back.
__label__2	A wonderful help for those interested in the military: This is one of the easiest to follow books on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.
__label__2	Good: Teaches you really good and easy to understand and allows you to learn the asvab with no problem in order to pass with flying colors
__label__2	Amazing book.: This book will help my granddaughter pass the exam for entering the navy. Anyone who wants to enter any branch of the service needs this book to study.
__label__2	LOVE IT!: I Love this book it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . It's not boring either . I love how it describes everything! Definitely a book to get to study for your ASVAB!
__label__2	already useful: my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this book really helpful on what to study. the preview tests are great mind joggers.
__label__1	FULL OF MISTAKES!!!!: This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher.
__label__1	Inadequate: The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can't hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections. It's obvious on many test sections that the answer is for a different question. Plus, the questions are way too easy--like training with matchsticks when you're going to have to move tree trunks.
__label__1	LOTS OF ERRORS!!!: This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
__label__2	"Almost perfect: I needed vents for my observation hive. I would have preferred something a bit smaller made of brass, but this is the best I could find. Keeping my fingers crossed, I ordered these up. After assembly of the hive, I found that they actually look pretty good and they do provide the ventilation required for the hive. The louver spacing is also small enough to prevent unintended escapes. A 1"" wood auger makes a hole perfect for proper fit. They are well made and the price is right."
__label__2	great early nick cave: boys next door is a very early incantation of nick cave.pulsating group of song from a master and Shivers is one of the finest songs cave has ever written
__label__2	"Interesting, fun and enjoyable.: I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
__label__1	aim low: Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests.
__label__1	"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM or FROM ADAM HERSH: They never sent me one of the items I purchased. I am still waiting for it. Now I just noticed that one of the items I bought from them that was supposed to be 16 x 20"" is much smaller.It has been more than a month after purchasing from them already.BEWARE ADAM HERSH"
__label__2	Very helpful: This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.
__label__2	You're Late Again Lord...: I really enjoyed this book. The author was refreshingly frank and backed up her points with scripture. I would highly recommend this book.
__label__2	"Right On !: This book is a terrific read! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. Karon Goodman is right on with her sense of humor and advice on how to spend your time while in God's ""waiting room"". Patience is not a strong point for me and I'll be darned if Goodman didn't describe me to a ""T"" while speaking of herself! Definitely a must read for those Thomas' out there!!"
__label__2	"This book was me to the core!: I can't express the gratitude I feel toward Karon, for expressing exactly how I've felt about going through ""the wait"" for so long. She hits the nail on the head with every single paragraph of this book. How does she do that? I found myself wanting to read it over and over, and truly contemplating the questions at the end of each chapter. Amazingly, the same answers kept coming up for me, so I truly got clear on what I had to do. Thank you, Karon, and thank you Lord for using her to help me! A MUST HAVE!!!"
__label__2	Does the job well! Just needs 1 tweak.: I'm not sure how much I can say about a meat tenderizer... it either does the job or it doesn't, and this one does, regardless of the meat. We've tried it on chicken and ribeyes thus far - it allowed the marinade that we use on ribeyes to permeate much better than before, which cuts down on time and makes a better steak! On the chicken, it easily turned standard grocery store chicken breast into restaurant quality tenderness.The handle is great, it's nice & comfy. The shape of the handle overall is ergonomically friendly.The tweak it needs: there are 4 disks in all, and all are stored in the head. The problem is that you MUST store the 3 that aren't in use in the head in order to hold the one disk you're using in place, effectively meaning that all must be washed, even though you're only using one. The benefit to this approach, on the flip side, is that you're less likely to lose a disk.
__label__2	Excellent tempo: I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. I would rate if 5 stars if it had any headstand prep work.
__label__2	love it: I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)
__label__1	"Say what??!!: Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
__label__1	not very exciting: I bought this video based on the other reviews on this websiteand I do not agree with the others. This video is boring, dull,repetitive, monotonous and unimaginative. Between each sunsalute there are stretches. These stretches repeat cumulatively! This combined with the repetitions of thesun salutes make for too much repetition.
__label__1	Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser: I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace
__label__2	Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.: As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great.
__label__2	"Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (""A Year in Provence,"" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his ""diary"" makes for a good read and a good history lesson."
__label__2	"Eternal City: The word ""journal"" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."
__label__2	"Babies LOVE this book!: We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
__label__2	This is my baby's favorite book!!: I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day. She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago. She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes. This is her favorite toy.
__label__2	"Can't go wrong w/ an old fashion cross track: We have one of these, and while we're not always able to work it into our layout on the train table, it's definitely been in some of our favorite configurations. Plus, it provides for that all important ""train crash"" action when two engines are trying to cross at the same time!"
__label__1	ADS Instant Video: You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient.
__label__2	Not a Hollywood Expose: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private.
__label__2	More Mrs. Heelis than Beatrix Potter: This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint.
__label__2	Good replacement part: This was a good replacement brake pedal pad for my 98' Toyota Tacoma.A little tough to get on but it does need to fit tight and does after you get it on.Thanks AMAZON for having parts like this.
__label__1	Bummed: This pedal was for a standard tranny - much to small for my automatic transmission brake pedal.I must of misread the description or something. Not inclined to go back and reread the description.
__label__2	Been Reviewed!: In my last review I said this book makes for edgy, fascinating reading! It is hard to put this book down! I also read this book as a senior in high school, between ages 17 and 18 years of age!
__label__2	"Definately worth knowing: I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read ""Diary of a Madman"", ""The Nose"", and ""The Overcoat"". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."
__label__2	Oddity of the Crazed: A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over.
__label__2	"Great Story!: If you have ever lived in a small rural town you will certainly be able to relate to and appreciate Jack Polidoro's latest novel, RETURN TO RABY. If you have not had this living experience, Polidoro's novel will enlighten you as to just what you have been missing! Polidoro's novel is based on the reality of a small New Hampshire town that comes alive page after page and truly shows how rural life can be. Having lived in a ""Raby""like town myself, I could relate to the story first hand. I passed the book on to friends who have never been out of the city and the book was equally enjoyable to them! This story will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. You will be left will a warm feeling and a positive outlook on life. This is truly a wonderful story!"
__label__1	"A poster? Really?: This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
__label__1	"a fine freshman composition text that costs too much: It is sad that this book--and the comprable ""Short Prose Reader"" from McGraw-Hill--are seriously compromised by the greed of a publisher that prices a book in its 8th edition that could be marketed profitably for less than ten dollars and prices it out of the range of poor students."
__label__1	Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.
__label__1	hummm: A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!
__label__1	"Nope, nope: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
__label__1	Only use if original pins are broken.: I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik

__label__2	Young man crazy about this book: Looking at this collection really shows the diversity in Hokusai's long career. In one of the essays, the writter comments that Hokusai changes his style so much that his work looks like the work of a different artist. The breath of this volume helps the viewer see how creative and inventive this master is. What I like about Hokusai is that his personal life is just as interesting as his work. The essays included do a good job placing the differnent periods in context with the times and Hokusai's own massive body of work.
__label__2	Lovely: I saw Beth Waters perform at Slims in San Francisco. I was not planning on getting there early enough to see her. I am so glad I did. I bought three copies of her CD, and hope to see and hear LOTS more from her! She opens her mouth, and out comes this beautiful, rich voice. She is young, and I think will grow as a singer and performer, but... trust me, this is a CD worth owning.
__label__1	Not good quality: This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?
__label__1	Do Not Buy: I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
__label__2	Gyroscope: The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.
__label__1	zero durability: the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all.
__label__1	"Rather plain: Disappointed by this item. I bought a couple of ""crystal"" decanters at the same time, which cost only a few dollars more. The difference was striking. This set is very dull, ordinary glass, and the rubber stopper in the decanter looks cheap."
__label__2	"Best Thing Ever Created!: My 3 year old is in LOVE with paint and this makes the whole idea of ""Painting"" more bearable for me. Instead of cleaning up paint messes on the carpet, on her and on the walls - I can sit her down on the sidewalk with this and she can paint away on everything (including the trees) to her heart's content. Wish they offered more colors, but being able to teach her that Blue+Yellow=Green is also a bonus."
__label__1	doesn't wash off that easily: We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.
__label__1	Not how I thought it would be: The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight.
__label__2	A very good read: Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed.
__label__2	Wonderful: We had to watch this in French class and I thought it would be a really boring movie, but it wasn't. This is a wonderful movie for students studying french and anyone who likes the language. Jean de Florette is the movie before this one and it is also awesome.
__label__2	an absolutely breathtaking score - captured my imagination!: just.....mmmmm....stunning....i listen to it when i want to BE french, to be in love and feel my heart break, to transport myself somewhere else in time. gorgoise!!!!
__label__2	Jean de Florette et Manon des sources: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une réponse de vous.
__label__2	"The final chapter of Jean de Florette: Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
__label__2	"a fabulous sequel: As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed."
__label__2	"great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, ""Jean de Florette"", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!"
__label__1	Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: A note of caution regarding this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import dvd under any circumstances. In an act of artistic mutilation, the pivotal and brief, chaste yet joyful nude dance scene featuring Manon is prudishly obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (though we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it. BTW, my rating applies only to the Korean import, other versions (dvd or vhs) get five stars.
__label__1	Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: I have only one thing to say about this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import version under any circumstances. In this version, the pivotal, brief and completely chaste nude dance scene featuring Manon is obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (but we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it.
__label__2	Good performances: I bought this CD because it's one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. The sound quality is good, and the guitar tone is good as well. I thought the tempos of the Suite were a little fast, but otherwise, a nice CD reference of Tansman's work.
__label__2	A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters: I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable.
__label__1	"Won't work in Dimage 7i: Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
__label__1	Wouldn't recommended: This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). I reformatted the disk few times and I'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera. Since it has a life time warranty on it, I'm RMA it back to SimpleTech.
__label__2	Great Product, Wonderful Price: I got this at an excellent sale price, and I have never regretted it. I haven't had a single problem with the card, and I didn't have to reformat it for it to work with my Canon A40.
__label__1	Too much money for a medicore card: The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company.
__label__1	"Speed IS actually an issue!: I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys?! My card didn't lock anything up, but it wasn't as responsive as two other brands that I currently use (I won't name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate). I do believe that I won't try them again until I hit upon their ""good"" cards though."
__label__1	It's dead on the first day!: I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500. I tried it by taking a couple of pictures. Suddenly, the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error. :( That was only 10 minutes of using it. Then I tried it with a Canon G2...still did not work...had to return it...
__label__1	"Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!: Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card, started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error, and acted upon the recommendation to format the card. After reformatting the SimpleTech card, still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos. I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon's wonderful return policy. I really do love this e-tailer!My ""meager"" Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine...."
__label__1	Compatibility issues - Be careful!: ...I bought this card thinking I could install it in my FujiFilm FinePix S2Pro and have no problems, but I got errors that could not be cleared by in-camera or Windows formatting of the media.I have never had a problem with CompactFlash before, and of the half dozen manufacturers I have, including Lexar, Sandisk, Nikon-branded, Fuji-branded and some Brand-x I picked up at Frys, all of them work in my S2Pro, whereas only one of the SimpleTech cards will.Better safe than sorry!
__label__1	"Is NOT compatible with Minolta DiMage 7i: I purchased the 256 mb compactflash card to increase the number of photos I could take, however after inserting it into my Minolta Dimage 7i, it gives a message of ""Unable to use card"". I emailed Amazon with the results of my problem, and also asked if others had the same problem (they did not state there was any problem)and they promptly sent me another thinking I only had a bad compactflash. The SECOND one also gives the same message. I will be returning both. I have purchased another brand somewhere else and it works fine. So,If you own the Minolta Dimage 7i - save yourself some time and headaches in returning it - THIS WILL NOT WORK!"
__label__1	"It does not work with Minolta 7i: It works with SimpleTech STI-UCF100 Reader,but not with Minolta 7i. It says ""Unable to use card"".Formating does not help."
__label__1	I'm afraid it sucks.: I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky.
__label__2	a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.
__label__2	It keeps working!: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.
__label__2	Very fast!!: Simpletech's 256MB CF is very fast. I use it with my Canon camera and love it. It gives me quick transfer rates with high resolution. Same time and money and any headaches.
__label__1	defective: After 6 months of very light use, this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip, taking 100 or so important shots with it. Cannot afford to use this kind of quality again.
__label__1	Crapped out on me.: Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for.
__label__1	Not for use with Canon Powershot: It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously.
__label__2	Check out the SPEED! From a Digital Guru.: I've read many reviews about Compact Flash card speed and a couple of them here on Amazon. I read one review that listed some very high speeds for other brands, above 8000 kb/s. I don't know where that data came from, but in independant photo review sites, this SimpleTech card screams. No other brand was faster. By the way, no brand has ever tested in Camera's that even came close to 8000 kb/s or above.Most CF cards test in at around 2000 Kb/s, some well known brands(SanDisk and Lexar) are at 800kb/s not 8000!!!! If you really want the truth, no card does well in Nikon's. They read at one bit, other cameras,Canon, Minolta etc read with 4 bits, are more advanced and produce superior results with both read and write speeds. The more advanced Camera's do make a difference. Check out independant reviews first, before you buy a camera or a card for your camera.
__label__1	CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews: After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble.
__label__1	"Too slow? Fast enough? Unreliable is more like it!: After reading some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. I purchased two and put them to the test. I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader. For reasons I can't explain, the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up. To double check if it was something else, I reproduced the problem 3 more times. I didn't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar, no prob!! So on to the second card. Guess what, no freezes, but the folks in the ""it's a slow card"" camp are right! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows? I just know I don't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches. Mine were returned. Good luck, though....."
__label__2	What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor.
__label__2	A wonderful discovery: Martínez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalbá evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure.
__label__1	Dragon Fire: I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
__label__1	basic grammer: This book contained some useful information on the basic grammer of the english language, but was mediocore (at best) compared to the Yarber's previous book (reviewing basic grammer, also available on amazon.com)
__label__1	oh shut up!: I found this book so over the top it was absurd. In one chapter it actually states that most people who try pot don't feel any difference at all and wonder what all the fuss is about. Give me break. I'm not anti marijuana, but I do feel there is a time and place to use it. The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible. Of course the economy as we know it would collapse but we would be too stoned to care. I thought the book would give a more factual account of the pros and cons I was dissappointed that it turned out to be such a fairy tale.
__label__2	Perfect Fiction: One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Challenging, epic, and stunningly beautiful writing. As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in.
__label__1	Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit.
__label__1	I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.: This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype.
__label__1	What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it: This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly.
__label__1	"What's the fuss all about?: I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
__label__2	Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude: I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali.
__label__2	For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature.
__label__1	Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time.
__label__1	Disappointing - this is not the Colombia I have found: This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail.
__label__1	Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it.
__label__1	pointless: I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it.
__label__1	Over rated and too politically correct: I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it.
__label__1	Confusion. Intrepidation. Asphyxiation.: In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere.
__label__1	Huh?: What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class.
__label__2	A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it.
__label__1	The worst book ever: When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read.
__label__1	"Maybe I just don't get it: Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his ""favorite book ever"". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."
__label__1	Started out good..: I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it.
__label__1	Yawn.: Characters aren't interesting. The story is not compelling. The plot is not engaging. No mystery of any kind. Just dull. Much ado ... why?
__label__2	One hundred years of solitude: I received confirmation that the book had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. The book was in great shape and the price was exceptional.
__label__1	I hated this book: This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end.
__label__1	"Disappointment: I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
__label__1	"Magical, mystical piece of tripe: I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
__label__1	Not for everyone: I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it .
__label__1	Glad to be done with this one: I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book.
__label__1	Absolutely Awful: I was very excited to read this book, and plunged right in when it arrived. As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is a complete waste of time-- so don't be fooled by people who claim this book is beautiful, like I did. It's anything but.
__label__1	100 years of tortured reading: I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
__label__1	The author put one over on us...: 10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!
__label__1	Most overrated book of the century: So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
__label__2	"A mirage of life: One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
__label__2	amzing and intellectually enriching: the book talks about passion, war, defeat and glory, family dramas and political upheaval. the book is touching and a good reading for understanding latin america and its people. praise for garcia marquez for such a landmark novel.
__label__2	I am in love with Gabriel Garcia Marquez...: A truly, life-changing experience. Magic realism, cyclical time, who could ask for anything more? Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for giving me this treasure and creating a cultural mythos for all of us.
__label__2	a major classic: i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.
__label__2	"One of the greatest novels!: Maybe G.G. Marquez's style is a little bit confusing. Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or ""Christ versus Arizona"" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."
__label__2	A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book! Highly recommended!
__label__2	A Sea of Latino Enchantment: I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds....
__label__2	Takers and Leavers a Continuum: Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center.
__label__2	Fantastical history of a common clan: This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention.
__label__1	"Not impressed: I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never ""get"" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me. I regret I could not finish Nobel prize winning author or not- maybe at some future date I will go back and try again. Sorry ----"
__label__2	Don't give up too soon.: This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens.
__label__2	"In its own class....: I just finished reading ""100 Years of Solitude"". I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out."
__label__2	"Fascinating but confusing: One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the ""first of the family line"" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."
__label__2	Not for the impatient or inattentive: I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =).
__label__2	Perfect: This is the definition of literature. Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition. I dare a serious, mature reader to pick this book up and not at least admire the writing. And the ending is something else altogether. Garcia-Marquez leaves the reader to ponder it. I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life. A MASTERPIECE.
__label__2	Allegorical Fiction At Its Finest: The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space.
__label__2	"Written with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!: One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of ""whaat!"" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!"
__label__2	Opens up worlds: Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved. He has expressed a preference for 'The Autumn of the Patriarch'. But for the rest of us '100 Years' opens up worlds, opens up minds and opens up literature. If you haven't read it you are missing a dazzling milestone in 20th Century literature.
__label__2	The great(est) American novel.: If you consider America the landmass on both sides of the equator betwixt the Atlantic and Pacific -- then American literature is truly enriched by everything that's written between Baffin Island and Cape Horn. As a young student in high school in American lit we read Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Fitzgerald -- great reading to be sure -- but only one slice of the expansive American experience. It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style
__label__2	"A Fantastic Story: 100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. Throughout the history of this one family, it is hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction. The best comparison would be to ""Big Fish"" in which the stories are tall-tales, but yet not without fact. All in all, I recommend this book to everyone."
__label__2	One Hundred Years of Solitude: An amazingly beautiful lyrical book which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book. And most delightful of all, the images linger long after the last page has been read.
__label__2	A masterpiece: My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty.
__label__2	Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear. This book is hard work, but only hard work yields great rewards.Best book in Latin American history and one of the 5 best books in human history.
__label__2	One Hundre Years of Solitude: It is a wonderful journey where the author takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere.It may takes you a while to understad I read the book 3 times the first time I had it and so far I read it 8 times in my lifetime and it never stops to excite me.You want to forget your problems, travel to Macondo and learn about making gold and many other things! discover another world.
__label__2	AMAZING book: There is very little that I can say that hasn't already been said. In short, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. It changed my life. It comes, as you might guess, VERY highly recommended.
__label__1	"lesson in depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
__label__1	Zzzz ...: One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story.
__label__1	Very boring and confusing.: I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple.
__label__1	Classic?: I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies.
__label__1	"100 Years of Absolute Torture!: This book is long, dull, boring and confusing. It lacks the passion that makes Love in The Time of Cholera so beautiful. It make ""Tess of the D'Urburvilles"" look like a fast-paced romp. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"
__label__1	A skilled rapist: The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it.
__label__1	"All tell, no show: I read literary fiction, ""smart"" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."
__label__1	Not a fun read: I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read.
__label__2	"One of my best reads: A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of ""small town Latin America"". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His ""Novel Prize"" in literature was well deserved."
__label__2	A Very Important Novel: One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece.
__label__1	"100 years of slow reading: This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as ""Love in the Time of Cholera"".Give it a miss and try ""Blindness"" instead."
__label__1	"big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
__label__1	one hundred years of futility: This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic.
__label__1	At page 250 I'm still struggling and am an avid reader!: I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down.
__label__1	100 years of boreitude: I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do.
__label__1	Confusing, Long and Boring: Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!
__label__1	"I wanted to stab my eyes out...: This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a ""preferred book"" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it. I found it BEYOND tedious.What's wrong with me? Why does everyone love this novel and I found it so annoying?Sign me ~BEWILDERED"
__label__1	Gave Up On It: found this a very weird book,just couldn't get going with it..maybe it was the translation..I might try again soon
__label__1	Disappointed: I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book.
__label__2	"So many Buendias: This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a ""classic to read over the summer"". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your ""things to read to remain well-rounded"" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"
__label__2	It`s hard to read it but u will be amazed by it: It was the first great book i`ve read and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this book is great.It`s just perfect.i love GGM and his style.He just manges to express feelings so easily and everything in this book seems perfectly beliveable even if some things are magical and don`t get in connection with reality.This book is hard to review.One must read it to understand it.It`s just that one cannot resume this book here.This book must be experienced.
__label__2	The World Repeating Itself...: The Story of Macondo and the Buendia family. What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us.
__label__1	"GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!: CUZ THIS BOOK IS A ""SNOOZE FEST!""ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
__label__2	Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you.
__label__2	Among My Most Common Recommendations: As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!
__label__1	"A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
__label__2	Not for chickens: This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics.
__label__2	An exceptional book; Beautiful!: There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it.
__label__2	"I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've ""finished"" it. it always pulls me right back into it."
__label__1	Enough is Enough: Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel.
__label__1	Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
__label__1	"Pretty stupid: Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or ""Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."
__label__1	pointless: This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
__label__2	Must read for everyone: It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally read this novel. It was well worth it, and I have read it again since then. It is a little hard to read, but it is a classic. I suggest that you use the family tree in the front of the book. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters. It may take you a little while to become completely imersed in the story, it starts out a little slow. But, it will be well worth it to keep going.
__label__2	Still reading, but definitely a keeper: This is a classic that I've heard so much about. I enjoy a good fiction novel and thus far, am liking this book.
__label__2	"One of my Favorite Books of All Time.: If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
__label__2	An Absolute Good: I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life.
__label__2	Magical Blend: Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century.
__label__2	Oprahs may be the devil...: But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont.
__label__2	"Thank goodness...: ... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, ""rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."
__label__2	Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try.
__label__2	One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!
__label__2	"sensational and invigorating: ""One hundred years of solitude"" is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. The family is being torn by the desire for solitude, as the Colonel becomes very aware of, and the need for love. Many characters repeat history, doing what theyre ancestors have done. This is a splendid book that was and easy read, but had alot of messages underneath the explicit."
__label__2	Use of language: I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily.
__label__2	"Best I've ever read.: Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"
__label__1	"Tedious: I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."
__label__1	One of the few books I have stopped reading: I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?
__label__1	"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book: I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
__label__1	One Hundred Years of Solitude: Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it.
__label__2	This book doesn't need anybody's blessing.: I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature.
__label__1	100 years to read, a bramble of impenetrable verbage...: It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one.
__label__1	Oh, my.: I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic.
__label__1	I just don't get it...: After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea.
__label__1	Struggling: I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves.
__label__1	"Would've taken me 100 years to read: I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or ""difficult"" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."
__label__1	The most painful reading and I did finish it.: My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny.
__label__1	The emperor has no clothes: Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep.
__label__1	Rambling, boring, and confusing: Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale.
__label__1	"ARRRRRRRGH: I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
__label__1	Terrible: I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one.
__label__1	I don't like it: The story is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Most of the characters in the story have the same name , who suddenly die and get replaced with another character with the same name. It becomes confusing after a while to track who is who, who is dead or alive or who is the parent of who. I stopped reading about half way because I was lost and confused. The book is not a light or fun read, it requires great concentration and mental effort.
__label__1	Appalling. . .: I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved.
__label__1	One Hundred Years of Solitude: This book has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any author on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo.........but really, the nobel prize for literature for 400+ pages of such bore and repetitiveness. I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material. Nobel Prize..huh..make a good soap opera.
__label__1	Glad I'm not alone in my opinion: I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it.
__label__1	very bad paper quallity: very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase.
__label__1	"Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point: I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a ""modern classic"", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."
__label__1	I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....: I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me.
__label__1	Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work: I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was.
__label__2	Brilliant: I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way.
__label__2	******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it.
__label__2	Rewarding.: This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding.
__label__2	A Beautiful Translation: This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!
__label__2	Amazing!: This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!
__label__2	The purest novel describing the human condition.: This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition.
__label__2	100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)
__label__1	What a drag!: I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!
__label__1	This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money.
__label__1	Not the best book ever: My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag.
__label__1	Bad, bad, bad: What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading.
__label__1	"Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?: Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
__label__1	babbling: Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book. End of story.
__label__1	I tried really hard....: I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next.....
__label__1	UGH...one of the most confusing books I've read to date: This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money.
__label__1	Book: This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all.
__label__1	Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize.
__label__1	Disappointing read: I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess.
__label__1	Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.: I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn.
__label__2	Well-written but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel.
__label__1	Fine, if you're that way inclined: Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle.
__label__1	Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read.
__label__1	"The Emperor's New Clothes: Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here. And to prove it see the review by Ann Pate ""Annie Pate"". Kind of remind me of Yoko Ono selling John Lennon underwear, all you get is the name and dirty laundry. I will bet my bottom dollar that most people only read this because it was on Oprah's reading list."
__label__1	Creative but boring and aimless: Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype.
__label__1	I DON'T GET IT: I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material.
__label__1	One hundred spastic pages: I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy. I hated it and only got as far as 158 pages before I gave up.
__label__2	Not for everyone, but if it's for you .... Hold On!!: As many reviewers have noted, it is not an easy ready but well worth the time and certainly the effort.There is love, intrigue, war, life, death, laughter and tears. All told in the classic Latin American Literature style. What more can a reader ask for?Pick it up, read it and dream about the characters for days.
__label__2	Excellent: A fascinating, difficult read. One Hundred Years of Solitude is a book that shouldn't be rushed through. Take your time and read at your leisure. If you hurry through it you will miss the beauty of this mesmerizing book.
__label__2	Get the tape: I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical.
__label__1	"I was surprised!: I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more ""light"" in both style and heart."
__label__1	look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?: well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out.
__label__1	"more stars than the firmament....: I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
__label__1	Super dissappointed: I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
__label__1	A fad which no one will remember in 100 years: so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.
__label__1	"uncannonized: doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"
__label__1	And the point is?: The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?
__label__1	why fill your mind with trash?: this book was trash to my mind, why fill your mind with junk? What good knowledge are you getting from this book, knowledge that is valuable to the mind and soul? NONE! It does not leave you with a good feeling!
__label__1	A book that left me indifferent: This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed...
__label__1	Extremely overrated: I can't understand the buzz about this book. I've tried to finish it twice and failed each time due to boredom.Perhaps it is better in Spanish. Is that why people love it? Personally, I can't understand why this is considered a classic.
__label__1	Colombian family values -- part II: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?
__label__2	Amazing!: Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time. Highly recommended.
__label__2	Great mount for my 40 inch LCD TV: We love this corner mount. It is plenty big enough and stong enough for our 40 inch Sony LCD TV. It's just what we needed!
__label__1	"Sorry but you're out of luck: Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40"" LCD. I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."
__label__1	Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far: This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle.
__label__2	"A great mount: I purchased this mount to hold my 40"" Samsung LCD. I needed a mount that would attach to the back of the cabinet yet allow the TV to extend out - that's where the 27"" reach of this mount really shines. All the necessary hardware (and then some) were included. Solid yet flexible. I'm very satisfied w/ this mount."
__label__1	Horrible: I purchased this card with the adapter. The card worked fine in my cell phone, but when I used plugged it into the adapter, my computer wouldn't read it. I know it wasn't my computer because other cards work fine. I contacted the company and one rep gave me the run around (via email). So I called them and the man was kind enough to send me a new adapter free of charge. That one didn't work either!! Waste of money!
__label__1	Can't play the great games on this one...: This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps...
__label__1	ATI needs to be more considerate: I purchased the Radeon 7000 and found that it was not supported by Madden 2003, so I went to replace it with one that was and found out that the ATI software was everywhere on my hard drive. ATI makes it impossible to remove the programs. I ended up having to format the whole hard drive!! I would not recommend this product to anyone.
__label__1	EMachines Owners stay away!: This card is completely incompatible with Emachines' Tri-Gem Motherboards. I uninstalled all of my previous video drivers because that is what ATI told me to do when I unsuccessfully installed their card. Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs [$$$] a minute! I finally talked to Emachines' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC. I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy. I give this card 1 star because I can't give it any less than that.
__label__1	Waste of money!: What a waste of money!!!! I was sooo exited about receiving this book, and especially because the reviews were so good. But a complete dissapointment. Hardly any pictures. Each hotel has a page or two briefly describing it, with artsy pictures which i hate, cause you only see a close of a stupid door handle, or a side of a table. IT MAKES ME INSANE WHEN PICTURES ARE LIKE THAT. PUT THE WHOLE PICTURE IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE! So if you think this book will show you complete pictures of hotel rooms, and lobbys your mistaken. Dont bother!

__label__2	Good, but not the best.: Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.
__label__2	A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.
__label__1	"Disappointing: I bought this book as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other ""professionals."""
__label__2	A book to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book. But this isn't like one of those health books that preaches all kinds of impossible advice. It's filled with really simple recipes. The ones I've tried are easy to make, and taste delicious. It's food for kids as well as adults. At last, we've got a book on the kitchen shelf that we can trust completely.
__label__2	Easy to understand advice about diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines.
__label__2	Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar: I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!
__label__1	"Eat away diabetes ""Yuk"": the book was easy reading with some interesting facts.But...the recipes were not very palatable. I gave the muffins I baked to the birds because they tasted like bird food and the rest of the dishes I tried to feed to the dog.I do not recommend this book.There are more out there with more information about diabetes and better recipes."
__label__2	"The Man! The Myth! The Hair!: This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song ""Rockin' This Joint Tonight"" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me."
__label__2	Planning for elder care from a family point of view: Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis. Long-term Planning for Your Parents is a easy to read guide for families who are planning ahead or those who need to make informed decisions quickly about long term health care/living arrangements. What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research. I would recommend this booklet for parents and adult children, work/family resource professionals, and companies who provide resources for their employees on balancing work and family.
__label__2	The Best Of The City Watch Books: In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. It was a great sequel to Guards,Guards and I really looked forward to reading it at the time. I enjoyed the introduction of the new members in the Watch since it gave the book a bit more variety. The plot between Carrot and Angua was also intriguing at the time. Im a big fan of Terry in general but the Watch( Commander Vimes in particular ) hold a special place in my heart. Keep up the good work Terry, your doing a great job.
__label__1	No Footnotes?!: I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!
__label__2	Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful! If you're driving, jogging, or even folding laundry, this audio narration is perfect for those times when you can't pick up the book and read for yourself.
__label__2	Fell of my bed laughing!: This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I read. Now I have 10 others. This book was funny in so many ways. One of my favorite things is Mr. Pratchett's use of footnotes. The one about Bloody Stupid Johnson is the best! I highly recommend the whole Discworld series to every reader.
__label__2	My first Pratchett book -- I'm hooked!: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive.

__label__1	"Kindle Price Too High: Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."
__label__1	The book itself gets 5 stars: ...but for the money, they need to do a better job with the footnotes in a Terry Pratchett book. At some point there is a bookmark that gets embedded in the text, so all following footnotes are off by one and you have to do prev page to see the right one. Also part of another footnote or 2 get embedded the same way...kind of ruins the effect.
__label__1	HarperCollins needs to get with the times: Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive.
__label__2	"Nice and necessary: Meet Carrot, Angua, Vimes and the other watchmen in their debut performance as they leap into the Discworld. This is the first of the ""Vimes"" stories, so it is important for a basic knowledge of people you`ll be seeing a lot more of(depending on the humour of old man Pratchett). It`s no less funny than the others, while at the same time introducing detective work into the series as Vimes and his crew bumble along on a sinister case. They are, after all, policemen(no offense to policemen in general). Read it and love it. It`s different, but at least as good as the other Rincewind and Death books."
__label__1	Warning!: This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]
__label__2	Pratchett is Magical: Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story.
__label__2	Terry Pratchett is a great author!: This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read.
__label__1	"I didn't catch the catch: This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."
__label__1	"Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star: There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."
__label__2	"It's Abridged?: Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all. Corporal (now Captain) Carrot is the catalyst of the change in the Watch, hiring 3 new members. Lance-Constables Angua, Cuddy, and Detritus (the former splatter of the Mended Drum). With the ongoing gangfights with the dwarves and trolls, Detritus and Cuddy put aside their differences and, with the help of Carrot, recruit more members to solve the mystery of Discworld's first -and only- ""gonne""."
__label__2	I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!: This was the second book I read by Terry. Since then, I've loved Discworld books about Ankh-Morpork (and especially the night watch). To get the full effect, read Feet of Clay, then Jingo right after this one.
__label__2	Why Ankh-Morpork is in trouble: This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion.
__label__1	"high school writing!: this is probably one of the worst books i have ever read. the prose is stilted and trite. i think the only reason it got published was because it is about a lesbian relationship. the characters are flat - no depth is allowed them. there are so many more and better books about lesbian relationships, start with those. if i were to rewrite it, i would yell ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" at the writer in a fit of rage. the sentences are reminiscent of Hemingway, except lack his literary value. everyone is rich and beautiful. it is the 90210 of the lesbian fiction world."
__label__2	"Not Bad: I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
__label__2	fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging.
__label__1	Very disappointed: I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality. I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly. I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time. (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)

__label__2	Max Keeble is extremely cool: I wish Max Keeble was my father. He repersents all that is good & just in the world, and is the point of my obsession. However, the way they repersent the fat kid, I believe Robe was thy name, is perposturous and insulting towards my superior intelligence. He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him. I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties. With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk? IT WAS HER SEAT... The principal scared me a little bit, with his insane hi-jinks and all...The Saga Of Max Keeble makes me proud to be an American. Wear the red, white, and blue proud Max. Wear it proud.
__label__2	An affordable collection: Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old.
__label__2	A Must-Have DVD!: Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!
__label__2	Strong Medicine: I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Shouldnt they be by now? I would buy all of them and be proud to add them to my movie collection.
__label__2	Fans want more seasons of Strong Medicine: This was a really great show. I hope they hurry up and release more seasons. They got better with every season and the final episode was awesome. I want to own the entire collection!!! Please release them soon.

__label__2	Interesting: This is an interesting series for someone who likes watching medical dramas and it has a great cast as well.
__label__2	Cooper and Kaplan: my heroes: After reading several academic papers concerning activity based costing I still wasn't convinced about the usefullness of the methodology. After reading Cost & Effect I revised my opinion on Cost Management. This book gives all the answers to effective Cost Management. It takes you from the ABC Age to the Activity Based Management Age and clearly helps you to understand what costs are alle about. Once you really understand the topics of this book you will be able to face and manage costs in whatever business you are in. Read it!
__label__2	"Excellent Family and Social Psychology Novel...: This Reader's Digest Reissue of M. Millar's ""Stranger.."" is long overdue. Most interestingly, the author is very similar to her late husband, the better known Ross MacDonald (Ken Millar) in exploring hidden family secrets, without the hard-boiled detective (usually Lew Archer) that made her husband famous. But Mrs. Millar is expert at depicting all social classes, including Mexian immigrants, and their family interests, and has a sly humor that keeps this book amusing thruout. Possibly the book drags a bit, but still a top drawer family history suspense novel!"
__label__2	Future: Despite being released at the turn of the 90's, 'Accelerator' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either 'FSOL' or 'LifeForms', and if they are remembered for anything it will be 'Papua New Guinea', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic. In 1992, it seemed as if intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate an irreversible shift in musical culture, and although FSOL didn't leave much of a legacy, this makes Basement Jaxx doubly pitiable.
__label__2	"A great cd to listen to while driving cross-country!: This high performance album by FSOL was a ground-breaker when released in the early 90's. Some had heard the phenomenal track, ""Papua New Guinea"" with angelic singing by Riz Mazlin (AKA Neotropic, and Small Fish With Spine) on the ""Cool World"" Movie Soundtrack and wanted more. Well, this album delivers a sonic bouquet for the senses, that is sometimes harsh, dreamy, and does not disappoint. It has not left my CD changer in over 7 years."
__label__1	Slow going: Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
__label__2	First ok Second Great: There to cds on this album.The first one is Accelorator.Accelorator is very good like... i like a couple of the songs but this is more of a more techno album. It has more the plan one bass beats. But i love some of the songs. I mean i love all the songs but if you like hardcore tchno.... i would'nt suggest the first disk. But buy it anyway becauser the second disk is fabulous!! Its the papa New Gueni (or how ever you spell) remixes. Hibrid,blue states,simone,mellow and more remix papa new gueni. The second cd in my apinion is better but its always different opinions. you should defenetly put some thought in and buy this album. its great!!!!
__label__1	"Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea: I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about ""Papua New Guinea"". Believe the hype about ""Papua New Guinea!"" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable (""Calcium"" and ""Expander""), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear ""Papua New Guinea"", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price."
__label__1	Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat: This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down.
__label__2	"Future Sound Of London - 'Accelerator' (Cleopatra): Good electronic/ambient artist's very first CD,originally put out in 1991.Took me awhile to land a copy of this title.FSOL is strictly a duo,members are Garry Cobain and Brian Douglas.Really quite a piece of work here,that is IF you dig this genre.Tracks that I remember to my liking were ""Expander"",their inspiring single ""Papua New Guinea""(have seen this tune mentioned in magazine reviews and articles before),""1 To 8"" and ""Pulse State"".Should appeal to some fans of The Orb,Meat Beat Manifesto,Sky Lab and Chemical Brothers."
__label__1	"Seasoned practitioners--don't bother: This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
__label__1	Designer Dependent: This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)
__label__1	In-line Writing Style: This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake.
__label__2	A Good Fun Guide to Swedish: I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided.
__label__1	"Rather outdated Swedish: I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resväskan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
__label__1	Helpful ? Not so much: Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas.
__label__2	Beautiful Lullabuy Music: I love this CD. I play it for my son when he is going to sleep. Very peaceful, mellow and soothing.
__label__2	invaluable: The authors have provided the quintessential study guide to The Canterbury Tales. This book is invaluable.
__label__1	retarded: this boke sux. its a bunch of midevil poetry. it is so retarded and dum. i dont like it al all.Initially published in the Journal of Literary Criticism, 24(1).
__label__1	"Be warned!: This collection of the entire Canterbury Tales (""translated"" -- how can English be ""translated"" into English? ""transposed"" or ""recast"" into Modern English is a more accurate way of putting it)is clearly and gracefully read by a variety of readers. BUT there is no accompanying Table of Contents, nor are the tales in the conventional order, so one has to search through 17 CD's in order to find a specific tale. I'd send it back if I hadn't torn the wrapper open -- which I had to do in order to discover this serious deficiency."
__label__2	"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore: Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
__label__2	"better than Decameron: To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you 've got to read ""Decameron"" by Boccaccio and ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" by Boethius.Read them and send me news on the online-review. ."
__label__2	storytelling and fun: A fantastic book with great stories of many a people. Unless pertaining an excellent vocabulary a dictionary or thesaurus can help with those words which look as if their been made up. These stories have a twist in almost every one of them and take you by surprise ensuring a smile upon ones face.
__label__2	Depicts every level of 14th century England.: Thoroughly interesting. The organization of this book must of been very creative for the time. A group consisting of everyone from a cook to a knight set out on a religios pilgrimage to Canterbury. A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy.
__label__1	bad version to read: The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem.
__label__1	Too bad I bought this book.: I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment).
__label__1	"A Good Translation but still disappointed: This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
__label__1	Kindle edition formatting is horrible!: The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible.
__label__1	Don't buy the Kindle edition: This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read.
__label__2	Narrative poetry at its best very comical: Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily.
__label__2	A good translation.: The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart.
__label__2	A Review: The Canterbury Tales was a notably written book,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect story. It was very interesting to read this book and I reccommend it for any others who like to read short little tales as are in this book.
__label__2	Children's Version! Not for the literary afficianado...: I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation.
__label__2	The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue: This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well.
__label__2	Recommend this seller: I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller.
__label__2	Chaucer appeals to everyone: The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging.
__label__1	"The Canterbury Tales by a modern hack poet: This set of CDs is a fraud! Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a ""translation"" by some hack poet. So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you. But it is definitely not Chaucer."
__label__1	Why is Chaucer so great?: Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least.
__label__1	"Wait long enough and anything becomes a ""classic"": Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."
__label__1	"For Simpsons fans.: If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
__label__2	Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast: At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking.
__label__2	"Classic: In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers ""Canterbury Tales"". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."
__label__2	It's a very through pocket book that can guide you in Laos: This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. I purchased this book in order to learn the language at a quicker and more simplified pace. It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well. Even though studying an entirely new language can be laborious, Mr. Cummings has made it easy for anyone to be bilingual, even multi-lingual.
__label__1	transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.
__label__1	insufficient to teach this tonal language: this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced.
__label__1	"No Lao-to-English!: This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
__label__1	Yawn De Florette: This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film.
__label__2	Beautiful and touching: I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/book I've ever seen/read. I love this story so much because it is so absolutely realistic and that it is human nature to do what a lot of the characters in the film did. There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book? (I read the French version).
__label__2	A Feast for the Eyes and Ears: Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight.
__label__2	Great story !: The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot).
__label__1	"Wonderful Movie...Bad Transfer: Since purchasing a DVD player a year and a half ago, I have often come across reviews that bemoan the ""transfer quality"" of a particular title. Now...I know what they are talking about.While this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I was extremely disappointed in the picture and sound quality. Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the ""transfer"" 1 star. Since this is not likely to be re-released as a ""Special Edition"" I would reluctantly recommend buying this title, only because it will have a longer shelf life than the VHS edition."
__label__2	Definitely worth watching, although the lesser of two parts.: Although new to French Cimema, this film has introduced me to some wonderful acting and cinematography. The set is impressive and the music is memorable.Having watched Jean de Florette first, I believe it warrants five stars of it's own accord. Manon des Sources is far superior, but there aren't many films that hold a candle to Manon, foreign language or otherwise.I certainly agree that this has to be seen to appreciate Manon. With these two films being one of the rarities in film making, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
__label__2	WOW!: As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs.
__label__1	Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo: I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space.

__label__2	"The closest thing to time travel: This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."
__label__1	Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here!: I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great.
__label__1	Interested in the great ship? Don't look here.: I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works.
__label__1	"1986 NOT 1912: If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend ""The Night Lives On"" by Walter Lord."
__label__1	"False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.: Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
__label__1	The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......: The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book.
__label__1	Awful book: This book was horrible. I've read many books on Titanic, and this has to be the worst. If you want to read a good book, check outA Night to Rememberor getTitanic: An Illustrated HistoryHalf of this book deals with the finding of the ship in '85. I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic.
__label__1	"Not the best: I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron's film. Many of the ""facts"" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it. It almost seems as if he is trying to convince everyone that he was a co-discoverer of Titanic and Robert Ballard's best friend. I would recommend another author, one who actually has a love for Titanic and isn't trying to make himself look better."
__label__1	This book is auful !!: If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it. Much of the information is wrong (Frank Tower ??? PLEASE !) The authors reliance on foul language to make his point ... all of this makes this book an annoying piece of trash unfit for anyone to read !
__label__1	False: I'm am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built.(in my opinion)And this book was very in accurate. The authors didn't really focus on what really happened. If I were a critic I'd give it... two thumbs WAY DOWN!
__label__2	New facts learned and old ones enlightened: When I first saw this book in my local book store about a year ago, I thought: Great, another book on the Titanic giving the same old facts and the same stories that every book on the Titanic contain. But then I picked it up and started reading, I learned about the more about the feelings of the officers and crew that night and the feelings of the men who found her. Although the book jumps around a bit, it was still enjoyable to read.
__label__2	Pellegrino is the best.: I love Charles Pellegrino. I read this book four years ago and have read other books by him which possess the same brilliant scientific analyses yet contain an intimacy of the subject rarely found in nonfictional books. I could easily imagine standing beside him looking over the water in sorrow. Although the movie was truly outstanding, it cut some of the most crucial scenes out (the radio controllers). READ the book to find out what the movie missed!!
__label__2	Enlightening and spell binding: I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!
__label__1	its too drown out: Birthright uses the battle system rules that are o.k. but they are not as fun as doing a mass battle by group.
__label__2	Great: A good one... and a few more words to fill out my review. I'd like to be able to just rate movies and shows without having to do this... someday.
__label__1	Lodge Book: For the price of the book I was looking for more recipes not a history of cast iron cooking. Not worth the price
__label__1	the complete book of dutch oven cooking: this book spends too much time on history and stories. beginners need to know how to determine the temperature of the oven. advanced cooks may know how many coals to put on and under but charcoal is better to learn with.twelve chapters of history and differances of cast iron and aluminum is too drawn out. the final blow is when there are only 19 recipes and most do not appeal to me.
__label__1	"This is ""The Comlete book of Dutch oven cooking"": Or this is catalouge book and nothing more.If some buy Lodge cast iron pot or pan,must have this book free of cost."
__label__2	THE GREATEST FILM SCORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIES: THIS IS FANTASTIC SCORE FOR ANY KIND OF A MOVIE, NOT JUST A CHEESY JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE! THE SCORE FOR THIS MOVIE WAS NOT ON THE VERSION OF THE MOVIE THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE USA IN 1962. HAVING NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL, UNEDITED, JAPANESE VERSION OF THE MOVIE, I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, IT INCLUDES EERIE, SCARY KIND OF MUSIC (YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE MONSTERS CREEPING UP ON YOU, RIGHT OUT OF THE OCEAN), TRADITIONAL JAPANESE PERCUSSION, POP MUSIC, CHANTING, A LITTLE TIN PAN ALLEY, BLUES, LOUNGE MUSIC, MILITARY MARCHES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS COMING NEXT. I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE WHOLE THING............
__label__2	Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!
__label__2	"Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
__label__2	"a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion: Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
__label__1	A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.: The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!
__label__2	Great Bed....Except for a Demon Dog: This bed is great, but since my dog is a puppy and has decided to destroy everything in sight - I had to take it from him to salvage what I could in hopes he will settle down with age. He has already destroyed my soaker hose around the foundation of my house, most of my plants, my sprinklers, a lot of the siding on my house....and more (the swings never had a chance). I think this thing is great and looks like it will work well, but I will have to wait to hopefully get its full use. One of th great things about it is that it has the cedar in it to prevent bugs and stuff from getting on him. I just have to hope this destruction phase will end soon. Enjoy.....
__label__2	Looking forward to reading other books by this author: This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
__label__1	buyer beware...this product and the company are a rip-off: this is a terrible product from a company that should not be in business. the scooter never worked...their solution was to send me a couple of neew components nad have me install. when that did not work, they had me run test after test after test...to no avail. the scooter does not work to this day. i filed a complaint with amazon...amazon did a lousy job of investigating and determined that the warranty was expired (30 day warranty!). of course it expired...they took a week each time to respond to my requests for help. the warranty was half over by the time i got the scooter after ordering it. i am disputing the charge through my credit card company, hope that gets my money back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXPERIECE THE SAME THINK I DID.BUYER BEWARE!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!
__label__1	Extremely cheap and poorly constructed, DO NOT BUY!: Everything about this scooter is incredibly cheap and shoddily put together. The seat broke under my weight (I weigh 165, well below the stated limit for this product) and half of the bolts holding the scooter together rattled themselves off within a few blocks of riding it. Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this inferior product.
__label__1	this scooter it only for kids scooter only 4 weeks: I am 22 years old men and i bought this scooter for the speed by ivoog scooters for 400 dollars with free shipping, and i like it,i have this scooter two months with problems, and the only big problem is that the wheels are very small to enjoy the ride safety,controller will stop working and then the company will leave you will not help ,and will tell you what could we do.and it not comfortable because it do not have any shocks so i do not recommend it all for adults that need to ride long trip,so adults for you good do not buy any xtreme scooters they are for kids you be not happy if you buy it.i bought the ezip 1000 scooter this is the best of the best scooter, with the x500 scooter i am 140 lb i ride 17+MPH and with ezip 1000 i ride with the top speed of 16+MPH and it fille really like 20MPH, and its very very comfortable so this for you adult you will love it and you be very very happy with it you see....
__label__2	So far so good!: The scooter has a good looking, the bateries last up to 45 minutes of continuos use but, need to change fuses evry long ride or every charging process, so far so good!
__label__1	Dull and Annoying: A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour.
__label__2	a teenagers opion: Ok I really like this movie I mean the story line was awesome. I watched it so many times at a friends house then borrowed it to take home. My mom watched it and hated it. She did not like the way the girls danced.... i dunno I thought it was great....
__label__2	"Piper is NOT Ugly!: Coyote Ugly is a sexy ""feel good"" movie. We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz. It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the ""F"" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."
__label__1	This movie was trite.: The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
__label__1	Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars.
__label__1	pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.
__label__1	EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!: I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire.
__label__2	Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!: Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen. You won't be disapointed if you see it. The actors and actress' are wicked!i give it 2 Thumbs up
__label__1	Hate widescreen format: Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format.
__label__1	I want my money back: This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special. Save your money and treat yourself to a Big Mac meal. It will go down easier than the characters in this movie.
__label__1	Boring: My friend likes this movie so I checked it out. I didn't like it. Kind of boring. Couldn't get through the whole thing. Fastforward solved the problem :)
__label__2	Birthday present for my niece.: My niece specifically requested this movie for her birthday. She loves the movie! It was exactly what she wanted (of course, she asked for it, duh!)
__label__2	GREAT DANCING: The story line for this movie was different - something new - which I believe we all need in this day!The dancing & music was great - I have the sound track and I have the movie in DVD and watch it alot. It's just great and Piper is wonderful.I'd love to see a sequel...........
__label__2	Surprise! A good story: This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching.
__label__2	Loved it: Don't know why but can't stop watching this movie. Love the story and the setting of the film
__label__2	Entertaining: I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
__label__2	Great movie!: We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!
__label__2	"GOOD LOOKIN'!!: My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
__label__1	Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad..............: Wow. This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything.
__label__1	Just another pretty face: This movie deserves every harsh review it gets. However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie. If you have a brain and like to use it, this movie is probably not for you. What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff.
__label__2	Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
__label__1	A unique torture-technique: I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon.
__label__1	"If only I could convince my wife: I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another ""Flashdance,"" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."
__label__1	"Unnecessary...: Hoping this ""unrated"" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent ""unrated"" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a ""harder"" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of ""Coyote Ugly"" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick."
__label__1	These chicks think they're so cool and tough: Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience. Stupid women.
__label__1	Total cheese-fest: I can't believe movies like this get made! This movie is CHEESY from start to finish. The characters are empty, the plot is thin, and the cliches are in abundance. Buy/rent this movie only if you want to laugh at the money you just wasted.
__label__1	men are pigs: This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked.
__label__1	Sexist film: Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today.
__label__1	Not worth buying...a renter at best: A plot and story that has been done before, better. Miserably bad acting: Tara Banks, Leanne Rymes. Only highlight: John Goodman. Better yet, rent something else.
__label__2	Cool, sexy and wild...: This is one of my favorite movies ever! It is a good story,a story that tell us to follow our dreams... I just say 1 thing to all the people that had [not] seen the movie... SEE IT!! It is just fabulous.
__label__1	Dumb movie: This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
__label__2	Enjoy: I really enjoyed this movie and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd. It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on.
__label__1	"How pitiful: I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of movies. When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn't very excited about it. But ""what the heck, I'll watch anything once."" First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I'm sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that's about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys."
__label__2	Excellent Movie!: When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!
__label__2	I love this movie: This product is really great for my trip. It also came in early and I am enjoying the movie.
__label__2	One of the Best movies I Have Ever Seen: I have watched this movie with my daughter about a million times over the last 5 years, and I can honestly say that it never gets old! The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman's finest performance. The movie will leave you feeling warm at heart over and over again. The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city. There is nothing in the movie that has a WOW factor to it, but that doesnt retract anything from the story to me. If you haven't seen it, you could do a lot LOT worse than to buy this movie.
__label__2	I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!: I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!
__label__2	More true than most people realize: As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want.
__label__1	too much gyrating and not enought interest for me: Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia.
__label__1	Iz love Tira but this is still abd: really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
__label__2	An Inspiration!!: This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.......and i do not care what you other people say about it!! A young song writer goes into the big NYC to sell her music and struggles without much money till she finds out about a bar needing some work......COYOTE UGLY!......finally she is making money and falling in love with an Australian Hottie....the rest is for you to see......i loved the story line of this movie....it makes anyone want to go out and reach their goals and dreams!........TWO THUMBS UP!
__label__1	Cringeworthy.: Viewed: 2/06Rate: 32/06: Coyote Ugly displayed a fair story that made my skin to crawl. A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations.
__label__1	"sticky sweet, predictable...: I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable. 30 minutes into it, I almost changed the channels. But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every ""twist"" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better."
__label__1	Make it Stop!: My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!
__label__1	A nightmare!: I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
__label__2	good movie: I liked the movie I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first movie I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed.
__label__2	Love this movie: One of my all time favorite movies. Quality of viewing was very poor, but Amazon was extremely helpful and refunded my price. Would try to rent again!
__label__2	this is jerseys movie: piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. she is an empowering actress and deserves an academy award nomination. the whole cast is great though. this movie is excellent.
__label__1	Special effects?!: Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again.
__label__1	"This is a 2 star movie if you're not a girl and under 16: This movie is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls. The guy in this movie does one of the worst acting jobs Ive ever seen, and nothing ever really happens. If you have a good taste for movies, then you shouldnt like this movie. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a ""cute"" story, but thats about it. (Also, no bar like that is going to have only 1 bouncer, gimme a break!)"
__label__2	Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
__label__1	"excruciating...: I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, ""Look how cute and adorable I am."" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."
__label__2	Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???
__label__1	"Good intentions... Horrible execution.: Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
__label__1	Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
__label__1	"A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the ""Frat Boy"" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the ""small town girl goes to the big city"" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the ""T"" & ""A"".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the ""acting"" is better on those cable shows."
__label__1	Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever.
__label__2	"Coyote Ugly ROCKS!: Coyote Ugly is one of the best movies i've seen so far. When i walked out of the theatre after watching Coyote Ugly, i was like ""WOW! That was a really good movie"". The actors are fantastic, cinematography was good, on top of that, the SOUNDTRACK is really really cool. I immediately went to the stores to get the soundtrack to the movie. Some people think that this movies has a lot of ""sexual"" content, but i think it's nothing more than just a few pretty ladies in nice looking outfits having the time of their lives. This movies is a MUST-WATCH and certainly worth the money to get it. Trust me, it's really fantastic."
__label__1	i hated this movie: I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well.
__label__2	Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie.
__label__1	Another tax-loss movie?: You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent.
__label__1	Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.: I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother.
__label__2	"A Great Sexy Movie!: All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
__label__2	"It's Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
__label__1	Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up.
__label__1	"Bruckheimer Should Stick With ""Guy"" Movies...: I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to ""The Big City"" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."
__label__2	Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness.
__label__1	One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing...
__label__1	really weak Film: nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
__label__1	Stage Fright Is Not Genetic: Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure.
__label__2	"Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.: This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what ""Queer"" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."
__label__2	"Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2.0: Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: ""Push It,"" ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,"" ""Temptation Waits,"" ""Special"" Rating: 8/10"
__label__2	Great CD: Definitely my favorite band. We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more.
__label__2	I can't get enough of this 'garbage': Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again).
__label__2	"A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans: This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. Such, direct and bold songs as ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""Pust It"", and ""When I Grow Up"" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive!"
__label__2	Not as good as the first: With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
__label__2	Is anybody here rating the Tab book instead of the album?: Great album. Always was, always will be, one of my favorites. Went looking for a guitar tab book on Amazon. Found one that said it had 542 reviews for it. Opened a review; not about the book, about the album. Opened another, and another, and another, you get the picture. Nice going Amazon.
__label__2	One of best pop/rock cds: Garbage is here again!!!! This cd is (little) better than the first and is worth buying. This cd is little old but I listen to it as I listen to newer cds. It is one of my best cds.
__label__2	"I LOVE THIS CD!!!: I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"
__label__2	"garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,: kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to ""the trick is to keep breathing"". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to ""BIG DADDY"""
__label__2	One of the best C.D.'s I've heard in a long time!!!!: This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2	I want to be Shirley Manson!: This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great.
__label__2	I love this CD!!! It's awsome!!!!: I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!
__label__2	One of the best CD's of 1998!: Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!
__label__2	"Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.: Garbage rules so much, it's impossible to describe in words. Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There are over twenty-five so far, and still much more to come, I'm sure. I don't need to use the playlist function on my CD players--I can listen to each. Besides Version 2.0, buy every other one they have out! ""I think I'm Paranoid"", ""Only Happy When it Rains"", ""Stupid Girl"", and ""13x Forever""(""13x Forever"" is only on the ""Special"" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. You have to hear them. GUFFYPUP'S APPROVAL RATING (1-10): 26"
__label__2	This CD ROCKS !!! This CD is GREAT GARBAGE !!!: Listen folks, you want a GREAT CD ! Garbage is version 2.0 is IT! This is one of thje BEST CDs I have purchased in a long time and my very 1st from AMAZON ! What a great price and service ! I work for a company involved in the design and creation of home and commercial theater, etc. I took this CD in the day I received it and let me tell you, what a demo ! We were all ready to party ! 500 QUALITY watts, 2 SUBS,5 Channels ! Thought we would crack the cement floor ! I have never purchased a CD like this with such cool tunes on ALL TRACKS. Keep on a rockin Garbage ! RKNM (Rockenem) in Portage WIsconsin !
__label__2	There are only a couple of tracks that aren't brill!!: Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'
__label__2	version 2.0-newer, faster, better: after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!
__label__2	"This CD rules!: I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."
__label__2	"The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. And not only to hear it. I bought it immidiately. It is one of the last (or perhaps, the first?) bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound. Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" or ""You Look So Fine""), sometimes they sound angry (""I think I'm Paranoid""), but all the songs that are here get along really well. In spite of all the differences between the songs, the album sounds consistent. Energy, joy, sadness, tenderness, love, hate. What else does anyone want from music?"
__label__2	"I liked it much more that the first CD...: I've enjoyed this CD so much! I bought ""Garbage"" and really liked it. Then my friend bought me ""Version 2.0"". I'm really impressed with the instrumentation and the lyrics. I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!!!"
__label__1	Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band.: Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore.
__label__1	Weak...: Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak.
__label__1	"Garbage is exactly that......: I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at ""art rock"" BORING"
__label__1	"Ditch the Producer: Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. ""2.0"" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."
__label__1	Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available.
__label__1	one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.
__label__2	You Betta Buy This!: What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff. Wonderful melodies, brash sounds, singalong hooks, and you can dance to it too. Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM!
__label__2	"Absolutely Outstanding: I must admit that I'm addicted to ""Version 2.0."" The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player. Described by Shirley Manson herself as ""mongrel-esque,"" the band's style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment."
__label__2	"warning: this CD is extremely addictive: All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
__label__2	"Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. ""Special"" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), ""Push It"" and ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."
__label__2	"I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is ""When I Grow Up."" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."
__label__1	I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. My rating? I'll give version 2.0 a C+ for a good attempt
__label__1	I was disappointed: Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are.
__label__2	"Garbage-Version 2.0: This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be ""Special"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". ""When I Grow Up"" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"
__label__2	"I'm a Garbage addict.... and this rocks!: This is the best CD I've ever heard! Once again, Shirley rocks on with those dark tunes. But this seemed a little happier-especially ""When I grow Up"" and ""Special""-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! This is certainly ""Special""!"
__label__2	"Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
__label__2	"Temptation Waits...: After a great debut, garbage made an album that made pop world better. With the songs like ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", ""Special"", ""Temptation Waits"", and a slow ballad ""You Look So fine"" they conquered the music world. Shirley Manson's voice was so great although a sad one...and a little bit creepy. The lyrics are quite creepy too. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine"
__label__2	"One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" and most of all the sparkling ""Special."" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like ""Hammering in My Head"" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever."
__label__2	"THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE.: This CD is a wonderful outstanding effort. My only worry is that they put all their eggs in one basket....How can they do better than this one? Every song is a wonder of its own. My favorites ""Special"", and ""Temptation Waits"". In my opinion this should of won as best CD of the year at the grammies over Lauryn Hill handsdown. Don't miss this one."
__label__2	"Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track ""Temptation waits"" reminded me a lot of the power that ""Supervixon"" had, & ""Special"" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks."
__label__2	OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. GET IT!!! Or if you are repelled@by the negative comments of others, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE FIRST!!!!@If you are going to read a book read Dangerous Angels: The Weetzie Bat books by Francesca Lia Block!
__label__2	Garbage is the best Glam Rock band!: Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. Their mix of heavy techno and heavy alternative rock makes this band unique and special..oh yes by the track on this CD. Very good CD, Garbage is original and great to rock out to and also to mellow out to...buy the CD!
__label__2	"good cd: this is a really good cd. i think that the song "" i think i'm paranoid "" is a funny song. and the rest of the cd is great"
__label__2	I agree: ... with all the other glowing reviews. I just want to add ... this is great headphone music! Put on this CD and some really good bass-boost stereo headphones. You will be blissed-out!
__label__2	"Garbage Is Anything But...: While I only give Blondie 5 stars, Garbage is my next all-time favorite band! This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like ""Special"" and ""Push It"" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!"" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!"
__label__2	"More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: ""I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.""Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly ""Push It"" and ""Special"", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: ""Temptation Waits"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Medication"", and ""You Look So Fine.""Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."
__label__2	Great CD!: I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!
__label__2	I never get tired of it!: Not many cd's can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Version 2.0, however, is one of the elite few who will have you praying for Garbage's next cd! So every one, go out there and buy this cd cause it has to be the best I have ever heard!
__label__2	"Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!: if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
__label__1	"Changed too much in too little time.: The band tried to pioneer a little too much into dance and electronica too early. Though ""The Trick..."" was the only good song with their new sound, ""Hammering..."" and ""Sleep Together"" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of ""Special"" and ""The Trick..."" and go from there."
__label__1	Paranoiac...: This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
__label__2	Love this CD!: I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
__label__2	You gotta love garbage: After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!
__label__2	if ya like the first one, you're gonna love this!!!!: This is a great CD and all I can say is that if you're a fan of the first album....you have to get this one.
__label__2	Good: I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END
__label__2	pertty good: I do enjoy this ablum and would recommend it. I am not sure if it will be found to be as strong as some of their other music, however, it you are a Garbage fan, I think this will work for you.
__label__2	"the best album on the market: i started out taping garbage songs off the radio, till i figured out i could get them all on a cd. so i bought it & i still play it non stop. wherever i am in the house, its playing. i actually bought this before their first album, but i havent been disappointed in any of their music. this is an album you can let play through, without ever wanting to skip. my favs are ""when i grow up"" and ""temptation waits"", but they kinda rotate depending on my mood. this cd has a song for every mood, so go buy it now, you won't be disappointed."
__label__2	"Great CD by a great group.: This is a great CD. Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD. Songs like ""Temptation Waits"", ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"", ""Sleep Together"" and others really show off the quality of this group in a way you would otherwise not know. If you like what you've already heard from Garbage, you really need this CD, you will not be disappointed."
__label__2	An amazing follow-up...: I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better.
__label__2	"THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!: This CD is the bomb. GET IT! It's much more organized than the first. Garbage is unique, compared to other bands. I love this CD. It is my life. HELP I""M A SHIRLEY MANSON WANNABE! I love you garbage!! I'm telling you guys, if you don't get this, you are missing out on SOOOO much!GET IT!"
__label__2	New Type of Funk: new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here.
__label__2	GREAT ,BRILLIANT ,SUPER!: I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it.First thing I can say is that this album is one of the best albums in the world!All the songs are great and I cannot spend a day without listening to it.Shirley's vocal performance is perfect as usual!After listening to Garbage's albums the other albums don't give me the same pleasure.GARBAGE is surely the best band in the universe for me and the members are really great people!I'm sure they will continue their success with their 3rd Album and if I was going to a deserted island, one of the 3 things that I'd take would be VERSION 2.0 (the others would be the batteries and my CD player for listening to it :))
__label__2	"A very ""Special"" album.: I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."
__label__2	"Garbage is great!: Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like ""Stupid Girl"" ""Queer"" or ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is ""Temptation Waits."" ""Hammering in my Head"" is great, too. The most popular ones, ""Push It"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."
__label__2	Just when you think it couldn't get any better.: I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs. A perfect application for parties, driving and getting things done.I'll wear this disc into a coaster in no time.
__label__2	sticky: Garbage did it again! Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower.
__label__2	Don't forget to take out this Garbage!: I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic.
__label__2	AWESOME!: Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed.
__label__2	I loved every minute of the cd: I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album.
__label__2	this CD rocks!: This album is wonderful.I must tell you the first time I listened to it, I loved every single song on the disc.The lyrics are catchey and the beats are incredible!Buy this CD and you will NOT be wasting your money!
__label__2	Now THIS is music!: Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man. I'm so happy I have it + it exists.
__label__2	One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !: Truly the best album I've ever listen to. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. I love Shirley's voice, its sultry and seductive, and she really rocks. All the tracks are great! Go out and buy it! Its definitely worth it.
__label__2	Special CD: This is a wonderful CD, Shirley Manson has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. I was hooked the first time I heard them, the songs are great.
__label__2	An amazing CD. . . the best of '98-'99: Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!
__label__2	"Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. But Version 2.0 comes very close to the thrill I got from the first CD. It's less ""spooky"" than their freshman effort, but more ""powerful""."
__label__2	This is the type of 'Garbage' you don't throw away!: Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day.
__label__2	Adds new fun to the track: The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it.
__label__2	Good addition to your Brio collection.: Even though it's a bit pricey for what you get, it's a fun addition to your collection. It gives the little engineer another interesting way to manipulate a train, especially battery operated trains. I would recommend buying more than one set/box if you have alot of track - it's fun to keep changing the direction of the trains to make them follow the many different directions of track. I have one set now and plan to buy another.
__label__1	Not PCI Port: I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it.
__label__1	stinks: this thing smells and transfers the smell to your hands. very chemical like poisonous odor. put it in a cotton sock until this comes, then will throw it away.IMAK Stress Ball, Grey (Pack of 4)
__label__2	A good season: I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item.
__label__1	Terrible season. Terrible stories.: First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6.
__label__1	cheaper at target: I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....
__label__2	This was a Great buy and a good shipment!: I recommend this product and i had no problem with the company that it came from. It got here on time and in Great shape.
__label__1	One Tree Hill Season 7: This was a good product overall. it was just bad quality. it seemed like it was burned off of an original. Every disk says disk 1 the title scene is blurry and parts of the episodes are pretty choppy.
__label__1	BOOTLEG: The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. Super annoyed and disappointed with my purchase. . . .
__label__2	One Tree Hill: Anyone can get into this show. For all ages. It's very addicting and i wish it never ended. Worst part is Chad leaving
__label__2	One Tree Hill: Great cast. Great episodes. Great price. I love every single episode from this series. sad to see it come to an end.
__label__1	So Corny.: First, I want to say I watched the entire season and have seen the entire series. This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money.
__label__2	One Tree Hill Season 7: This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international.Package was not damaged in the slightest and ive enjoyed watching every second of this season as it has not yet been released on DVD in Aus yet.Good work!
__label__2	very satisfied: The quality of the product was perfect. Brand new. It was sent out it two days. I was very satisfied.
__label__2	Very pleased: No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
__label__2	Love this show!: I love this show, I bought this season to complete my collection. They have made the boxed set boxes a lot smaller in size over time, but still packed with all the great episodes of this fantastic show!
__label__2	Guardian Heroes 2 vs. Sega Saturn guardian Heroes: All in all this game is amazing!!!I'm sure all yuo old school sega fans out there know what I'm talking about. The ground breaking genre defining Guardian Heroes!orgionally, the first Guardian Hero game came out on the legendary sega saturn and there was and still is nothing like it. If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game! It was a bit sad to know that they've all died, but it was absolutely a must for the developing storyline.If you've played the first one I'm sure you'll agree the way the story goes is PERFECT! I wish I could give this game 10 stars...Long Live Prince Valgar!!!
__label__2	Not long enough: This game is fast paced and action packed. All the moves are easy, the versus mode is fun, controls are tight. 2 minor complaints: The game is too short, and the music leaves a little to be desired. But you'll be too busy fighting hordes of enemies to notice.
__label__1	"Crappy Guardian Villains: Do you want a game that makes you frustrated? Do you want a game that gives you an excuse to throw your GBA at a wall and hit it with a hammer? Do you want a game, that makes you bang your head on a wall over and over again? If so, buy the game! If not, oh sweet mary do buy it! Please do not buy this! Please! This game is self-proclaimed to be a difficlulty level for children. You would need to have the devotion of a Shaolin Monk to master this game! It's soooo fricking hard! It's like trying to play Mario Party 4 while having a seizure. THe Japanese to English translations are terrible! The story make no sense, like all japanese games. There is this ""soul of hero"" trying to fight ""the choas"". Oh and If you die, you either get to use your soul to revive you to the last check-point, or trade in your soul for ""Devil Mode"". ""Devil Mode"" is when you get unlimited hp and magic for 6 minutes and you die. THis game isn't worth your time, or money."
__label__2	Jula Bell gives me shivers: This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Cudos to Kent. My favorite part is the final cut by underground artist Jula Bell. I was so pleased to hear her singing on something like this. Cheers to Kent for having the guts to take a chance with someone who is a truly cutting edge artist known for her integrity. I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his. It's simplicity and bold melody is the heart and soul of the soundtrack. Why wasn't this song in the movie? Buy this cd to hear one of the best female vocalists out there---
__label__2	"Sting's the Star: The majority of cuts on the CD are run of the mill soundtrack fair. That being said, the CD is worth the purchase price for ""Until"" written and performed by Sting. I predict it will become an ageless favorite!"
__label__2	A Must for Kate & Leopold fans: The music on this cd is a lot like the movie...different, but with a great romantic edge to it. The only thing is that to enjoy it, you need to like music with no words that can put a picture in your mind...this does exactly that. If you loved the movie, I would DEFINATELY recomend this cd.
__label__2	"Excellent!: The soundtrack for ""Kate and Leopold"" is an excellent one, and the beautiful and dreamy musical segments evoke warm and happy memories of the delightful film and the scenes which are represented by the music.I am very happy to have bought this CD."
__label__1	Not worth the money: The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song.Spend your money on something else or buy a whole cd of sting, not justy one song.You will be glad you did.
__label__2	Great Game for Young Kids: My kids ages 5 (boy) and 8 (girl) love this game! They are obsessed... It is the one that has been able to keep their attention more than any other so far.
__label__1	It didn't work.: It didn't work. I was excited that it came in fast. but the game does not work. it made my kids sad. Waste of money. I do not recommend buying this game. First time it happened to me. Good luck if you decide to buy it.
__label__1	Amazon duped. Me too.: This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK.
__label__1	Pac Man World 2: I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it
__label__2	"Jane Fonda in ""Julia"": I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave shine in their roles in this excellent film based on Lillian Hellman's true life experience during war time. Fonda is at her best in this film playing Lillian Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave won an Academy Award for her performance as Julia. It is a movie not to be missed by serious film buffs."
__label__1	Be aware!: This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
__label__1	Julia: I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not.
__label__1	I don't understand all the hype over this: Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
__label__2	"Compelling, wonderful film: I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."
__label__2	What happened to this DVD?: The date says January 1, 2010. Anyone know what happened to prevent this from coming out today, June 7, 2005, as originally planned?
__label__2	Continuing enjoyment through the years: This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD.
__label__1	fun at first but will get boring: only the first case is fun and the rest are stupid. dont waste your money on this game like i did
__label__2	"Wow.: This collection of short stories is destined to be a classic and a ""must-have"" for people everywhere. Take a look at yourself and at your fellow man. This book is great from cover to cover."
__label__1	I like the idea, BUT...: As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it.
__label__1	yoga for surfers: don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
__label__1	Dont buy: This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
__label__2	Wow!: Yoga For Surfers is one of the best DVDs I own! I am convinced it is by far, the best yoga tape. Even as a beginner, I can see how it has helped me become more flexible and with such amazing surfing and how radiant Peggy is on-screen, I can't help but get inspired every time I watch it!
__label__2	Amazing!: For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it.
__label__1	Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place.
__label__2	Great DVD: This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.Works great before my surf sessions. I just hope to be able to do the poses all the way soon. It's a great way to start my day.
__label__1	Yoga For Sufers Review: As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice.
__label__1	Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class.
__label__2	I Love this Video: I love this video -- everything about it is so true. Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses. The music is enchanting and adds to the uplifting nature of the program. And the quality of this video is the best I have ever seen - gorgeous surf and beach scenes and top-notch editing between the poses. I recommend this video to everyone!
__label__1	Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying.
__label__1	"PLEASE READ: This book does NOT contain a book key. I returned one and the next one didnt have it either. The OLC passcode card is nothing either. The card says that ""code is no longer necessary"". Basically this is a like new book with no extra features. Buy used!"
__label__2	very helpful: I have found this to be a very helpful workbook to go with Que Tal text. The answers are in the back for self check. It incorporates the vocab of the chapter with the grammar covered.
__label__2	"Night Vision: The standard lighting (headlights) on our 2001 Ford Ranger was disappointing. As you get older, you come to appreciate better lighting and the factory headlamps are poor. I tried the better bulbs from NAPA without a great improvement. Finally, I ordered the PIAA's and they represent a great improvement; they seem like twice the illumination of standard lighting. I only wish they were available in""off road"" strength."
__label__2	Bright white: Installed these on my 2001 F-150 WOW a Big difference even in big city lights night driving, these bulbs really perform well.
__label__2	xtreme white plus bulbs: the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
__label__1	Save your money: These are not as bright as the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra and cost a whole lot more. They do not perform as advertised.
__label__2	I like em!: Put a set of PIAA headlamps on my Ford Ranger and woke up the night! Not too bright as to annoy on coming traffic but waaay better than the stock lights.Big Jim Miller
__label__1	Not enough bag for the buck: I have 2 2005 Dodge pickups the factory headlights suck, I bought a pair of these for one of the trucks. I have to say they are brighter then the factory bulbs. The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs.
__label__1	Disappointed: With the cost of these bulbs I was expecting a WOW when I turned them on, but only got a very slight improvement from the previous bulbs. Maybe it's because their in an old Dodge Intrepid which are know to have poor light design. But I was really hoping for an improvement. I run them on high beam all the time just to be able to see at night, and no one has ever flash their lights at me.
__label__1	PIAA are whiter: There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn't to impressed. After driving with them I could notice an improvement over regular lamps.
__label__2	"An Essential For CD Mixer's!!: This double volume CD is a great tool for the begginer and experts DJ who mixes CDs. Since CD mixing is still fairly modern it is hard to find good loops, beats, scratches, and effects. Simmon Harris has put together a wide range of beats for DJ's to use. Each track includes the BPM (beats per minute), a very helpfull feature that you won't find too often. The price may seem steep at first glance, yet when you realize the use you will get out of this great tool it is worth it. ""Once you use it, you will never put it away"""
__label__2	awsume: i got this just it time to winterize our camper its better than draining all the water and replacing with anti freeze.. used it to blow out all water then just poured a little down the drains.. good price and shipping was fast..
__label__2	Rugged!: Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.
__label__2	This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure. That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex. This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.
__label__1	"Too Restrictive to allow air volume needed.: Plug has a tiny hole that is too restrictive to allow enough air volume through to do an adequate job. Hole may be small to attempt ""reduce"" pressure but that is not a satisfactory way to reduce pressure anyway. Need to reduce pressure on compressor regulator to avoid blowing out lines in RV Make you own adapter using a piece of garden hose, and the appropriate adapters to do a satisfactory job of removing all water from you RV lines for winter storage."
__label__2	A great book with lots of room for improvements.: I have experiences in many martial arts and had done lots of streetfighting, and I can tell a working technique just by looking at pictures. In this sense, I must say that 75% of Prof. Kirby's moves works well. His armlocks, for example, are more effective than those of Aikido. However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books.
__label__1	"Impractical: The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's, or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy, maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art, this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests, but not for serious self-defense.In fact, this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you're a student of the author, of course. I'd hate to see what the ""Basic"" book is like, and as funny as this particular book is, it's not worth the money to buy it, even for a good laugh."
__label__2	First Knight: The legend of King Arthur finds new meaning in this powerful romantic novel. When Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, finds herself desperate for protection for both herself and her people from an ex-Knight of the Round Table, she turns to King Arthur to save them all.Guinevere's decision - to marry the king, leads her into danger and intrigue as she begins the wildest journey of her life.When Lancelot saves an unknown lady in the forest, both their hearts become engaged. Lancelot becomes a friend and trusted confidant to the King, and Guinevere becomes Arthur's wife. While fighting to keep their love at bay, war threatens to tear them apart forever.Chadwick's love of re-enactment becomes apparent in this wonderful story of forbidden love. She describes everything in such striking detail; the reader can almost smell the stench of burning straw or feel the adrenaline and fear accompanying battle. This book is a must read, though not quite as powerful as many of Chadwick's other novels.
__label__2	First Knight (Cassette): Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again.
__label__2	One of my all time favorite books back in print!: A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up. My mom, an elementary school teacher, used to read it to her class every year. I have since purchased two used paperback versions of the book for my grandchildren, and I'm so happy to see it is being reprinted. I highly recommend this book for adults and children. It's a one-evening read for an adult, but I promise you will enjoy it.
__label__1	Biography of a Grissly by Seton: I didn't realize that there was no illustrations in the book and Seton was a very fine illustrator, so why would you publish one of his books without the illustrations?
__label__1	Ray Charles early years: I am very disappointed with this CD set. I hardly recognize the sound on many songs. My favorite is Georgia on My Mind. I never heard a rendition like the one in this set. It is terrible. I am sorry I made this purchase.
__label__1	Quality surprisingly bad: I am really disappointed with the quality of this 2 CD set. Plus, I wasn't able to find a track list anywhere, and I was missing a LOT of songs I was looking forward to having.
__label__2	"A tribute to the abilities of the WWII small carrier.: A ""must read"" for anyone interested in the WWII carrier navy, R.Adm. Gallery relates the tedium of service in Iceland, the terror of being stalked by German U-boats in the North Atlantic, capped off with the true-adventure tale of his Carrier Task Group's *capture* of the German U-boat 505 (now on display in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry) off the African coast. D.V. Gallery intersperses writing fit for an adventure novel with the facts of history from the ""big seat"" aboard the USS Guadalcanal - one of the ""baby flat-tops"" of the Second World War (probably the single most underrated warship of that war)"
__label__2	"Salty, irreverent, highly amusing: Clear the Decks!""Salty, irreverent, highly amusing"" -- New York Times""One of the best adventure tales of the war."" -- Time Magazine""A book you don't want to put down once you start reading it."" -- Our Navy""Clear The Decks... has an authentic, briny tang to it. And the climax, the tale of Admiral Gallery's brilliant capture of a German U-Boat, is breath-taking.... Anyone who wants to know the real reason why our Navy wins wars ought to read this book."" -- Herman Wouk""As an action-packed account of a baby flattop's campaign against U-boats in World War II, this is a corker. The author writes with warmth, understanding, clarity and rough humor."" -- St. Louis Post Dispatch""A good deal more than a series of belly-laughs."" -- BOMC News""You do not need to be a lover of the sea to enjoy this splendid and humorous."" -- Columbus Dispatch""A RIP-SNORTING ACCOUNT!"" -- Los Angles Mirror"
__label__2	A real-life lesson in leadership: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book.
__label__1	These are NOT the ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!!: Don't make the same mistake I did!!! First of all, there are only 6 discs, NOT the 7 discslisted! And, if you are interested in quality - meaning you'd like to hear these songs sung by the actual people who made them famous - then DON'T buy this product!!!

__label__2	"I find that Jeff Gold music is exceedingly uplifting!!: I own two CD's by Jeff Gold: ""Escapes"", and ""The Soul of the Mountain"". I find that his music is exceedingly uplifting, and after listening to his music colors seem to brighten and the belief in goodness is restored. (I especially enjoyed his compositions, ""Del Playa"" and ""The Soul of the Mountain"".) J.Gold is a gifted composer by any standard and he is unparalleled when it comes to writing music that has a healing effect on the psyche. I highly recommend Jeff Gold Music to Everyone!"
__label__2	Dr. Barnett's newest edition to a timeless classic: In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A. Barnett gives us this enlightened book to show us step by step the way that we can turn the key and free ourselves through the use of analytical hypnotherapy. The chapter on self hypnosis has taught me great relaxation skills. I have been a fan of this book for over 15 years and find it as relative today as it was when it was first published. This newest version comes with a wonderful new cover design and clean crisp text. Wonderfully written to be easily understood by both the student of hypnosis and the average reader. Well worth the asking price.

__label__2	"I think that its a good book: Anthony's works are all easy to read and the world of xanth draws you in automatically; I guess its the bookworm's equivalent of junk food--not nourishing for your literary education but satisfying nothenless. This book was one of the ""better"" books of Xanth--although i have yet to find one that didn't leave me rolling on the floor and lauging. Its fun reading about a barbarian...they aren't the typical main chracter after all and its interesting how Piers Anthony manages to make something fearsome seem silly and human."
__label__1	One of those addicting Xanth novels.: Once you start reading Xanth novels, they become addicting. This one is not as addicting as some of the series
__label__1	What were they thinking?: Seriously, I am quite the fantasy reader. However, this piece of dribble should not have ever been published. It is one of the WORST books I have ever read- in any genre. No plot or charecter development, nothing. If you want good fantasy, go read one of the DRAGONLANCE titles.
__label__1	Noddy Songs from Toyland: The CD cover shows the 'performer as Noddy'. However, the songs are sung by various artists. They liked the songs, but my grandchildren were disappointed. They thought they would hear the voices heard on the DVD's.
__label__2	ORDOR GONE: This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it.
__label__2	"Del Shannon Shines: Del Shannon wrote some of the most distributing and depressing songs in rock music. The eerie landscapes and sounds of songs like the classic ""Runaway"", ""Hats Off to Larry"", ""Keep Searchin' (Follow the Sun)"", ""Little Town Flirt"" & ""Stranger In Town"" speak of true heartache and despair. The sound that Mr. Shannon created was original and nothing before or since has quite matched the moodiness of these songs."
__label__1	Read as fiction: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
__label__2	Worked Great.: I had bought this some time ago, but never used it. Recently I had been having memory card errors on my Canon Camera. I decided to try the 4 in 1 cleaner and it solved my error problems
__label__2	Great little tool: I bought this because of errors on my Nikon camera to see if cleaning the contacts for the compact flash card would correct the issue. One cleaning and the errors are going. I'm going to use this to make sure all my cards are getting a clean contact with the device they're in. Pretty great fix if it prevents the need to send the device in to the manufacturer.
__label__1	"A great idea, but...: I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection. It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy. Unfortunately, the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB ""A"" cable end - which is what I really needed. If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that, but not the adapters themselves."
__label__1	"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.: This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
__label__1	It could be better: Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all.
__label__2	An unbiased history: One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
__label__1	Check the facts: I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association.
__label__1	Not real history: This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold.
__label__2	"Lovely Like The Moon: Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon. I feel the same way about the music of Jennifer Warnes. I'm glad to know it's there. Jennifer and her beautiful voice has been such an inspiration to me over the years. I am truly glad that this collection includes her early work. Jennifer's music will stand the test of time, i.e. 20 or 30 years from now people will still be listening to the music of Jennifer Warnes. But you don't have to wait that long. Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song ""all we have is here and now"". So buy it!"
__label__2	Vintage Warnes: A wonderful collection depicting Jennifer's unique talent from early on through her later years! It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Extremely glad I made this purchase!
__label__2	Essential: This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
__label__2	Excellent Recording Artist: Jennifer Warnes has always been a great recording artist and has made some fantastic titles songs for some of the greatest films in the past. She is timeless and this album is a great example of that.
__label__1	"OOPS.... That isn't Jennifer singing on track 18!: The duet with Steve Gillette ( track 18) is actually a recording of another friend of Steve Gillette's, not Jennifer Warnes . How tacky! How could RAVEN have missed that? I had to adjust the volume knob about five or six times. There is an odd ""wow"" falloff at the end of ""These Days"". Sounds like the engineer stopped the turntable manually.Jennifer Warnes was obviously not involved in the creation of this compilation. Too uneven, badly mastered."
__label__2	"This ""Review"" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?"
__label__2	"Great Show - I was there!: Great DVD! I waited 6 hours for front row seats general admission. It was worth the wait. A very HOT show. Not only was Warhol there, but some of the members of the 80's band the Go-Go's, and Adam Ant.In the last song ""Rock & Roll"", they do a 10 second close up of me in the audience playing air guitar. My 15 minutes of fame!Lou is the grandfather of Punk and a classic Rock & Roll ICON. But this disk & enjoy."
__label__1	sad: a long time lou reed fan was so looking forward to recieving this dvd. if you are entrenched into the talent and feeling and soul of the lou reed album rocknroll animal, you will be so disapointed with this dvd. sweet jane and rocknroll i swear could be played better by a holiday inn cover band. save your money.
__label__2	This cd is absolutely awesome. Steiner at his best.: I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well.
__label__2	"Great Early Dixie Chicks Single!: ""Goodbye Earl"" was the single that opened my eyes for the Dixie Chicks. This single taken from their first album ""Wide Open Spaces"" is much more ""country"" than ""Earl"", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your ""troubles"" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.""Am I the Only One"" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of ""There's Your Trouble"" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is."
__label__2	Monster memories: Good Copy of orginal score.The Wolfman is the stronger of the tracks here though Son of Frankenstein is not in the same class as the music from The Bride of Frankenstein is still invokes great moments from the movie.Great for collectors even if they are not horror fans.The Wolfman tracks from the film are the first to be recorded and also includes music that was wrote but never used in the finished movie.Listening to the music from the DVD realeases of the films, you would find it hard pressed to tell the difference if any.
__label__2	A Great Find!: It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on. A true must-have addition for the classic horror collector!
__label__2	"IT ""s GREAT ( realy): hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
__label__2	"Examining the Myths: I felt like cheering most of the time as I read this book. Ms. Venker writes so articulately regarding many of the thoughts I have had as a mother, but didn't know how to express. She is thoughtful in her comments and very honest. She doesn't portray motherhood as being totally blissful, but does express the importance of actually parenting your children once you decide to have them. She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices. We need to make sure that our children's needs are our first priority as we make our choices. We can ""have it all"", but maybe not all at the same time. Thank you, Suzanne, for saying what we all need to hear!"
__label__1	Just because she couldn't do it: Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone.
__label__1	sad state of affairs: Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH.
__label__1	"Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""?: The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
__label__1	Misguided author: The author is attempting to justify her own choices by putting down working mothers. Do yourself a favor and don't order this book!!
__label__1	Ideological rant: This book is meant to make working mothers feel guilty while glorifying the stay-at-home mom. Numerous academic studies disprove their thesis--studies that the authors choose to ignore. Read this if you want to reinforce your pre-existing world view. Otherwise, don't bother. There's little factual basis to what they say.
__label__1	Piece of garbage!: The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else!
__label__1	What a stupid book!: Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!
__label__1	Leaks: If your drive thru mud and rain expect water to get in this bag. It is not very water resistant.
__label__2	I love this product: I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. The important feature are pronounciation and quickfind. Just by mouse over the word you can find out the meaning.
__label__1	"Disappointing book. Not what I expected......: Just another book with huge text and lots of wasted space (that makes you think you are getting a lot of reading material).Unfortunately, not much info in this book. If you are looking for a simple, down-to-earth useful book, this really isn't it.Perhaps the other book I ordered, ""Healing Secrets of the Native Americans: Herbs, Remedies, and Practices That Restore the Body, Refresh the Mind, and Rebuild the Spirit"" [Hardcover] will have more useful info. If it ever gets here that is :(My verdict? ""Secrets of Native American Herbal Remedies: comph GT Native amern Tradition Using Herbs Mind/Body/Spirit Connection for ipvg (Healing Arts)"" [Paperback] is a complete waste of money."
__label__2	GREAT BOOK: Great book very interesting, glad I bought it, and for the rest of the books I've bought, just glancing thru them, they're great, love them all, a couple I have to order more because my daughter loved them and took them home with her....
__label__1	Failed expectations: I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America
__label__2	Bought this as a gift and they are very pleased with it: I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
__label__2	Great scary read, would be a good movie....: Masterton has done it again. This book surprised me and also scared the hell out of me at times. People in the reviews are complaining about this book being a rip off of other books...give me a break. This has a HP Lovecraft twist but in a Masterton way! He brings out the FLAVOR of it all. the ending was a disappointment with what the character does, but hey, that is life in the real world. If you enjoy a really creepy haunting tale, this one is for you....
__label__2	A pretty damn good blood drenched read: PREY isn't Mastertons best, but is entertaining enough. It's in keeping with his usual blend of intelegent horror and all out gore. I loved the book, and read it in next to no time, I dont usually read books twice, but I did this time. OVERVIEW: Intelegent. Bloody. And a great cast.Masterton has again come up with a winner, a page turner. A gore fest that will satisfy even the most thirsty of Horror fans. Pick up a copy, you wont regret it.Nice One Graham.... (Keep writing em.)
__label__1	Should characters have brains?: When I first started to read this book, I recognized right away a lot of potential in the story. All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1.
__label__1	"HPL would be spinning: This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's ""Dreams in the Witch House.""It's not a good Masterton book, either. The last 30 pages seem as if he had to get it done fast, or be sued by the publisher.Skip it. ""Spirit"" is a lot better."
__label__1	Started well, then...: turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book.
__label__2	IT IS A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CANNOT BE SCARED.: A HORROR BOOK CANNOT GET BETTER THAN THIS;G.M HAS A WAY WITH WORDS TO SCARE THE BEJEE'S OUT OF YOU. HIS STYLE , PROSE AND CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS REFRESHING , ENTERTAINING AND NEVER LACKS TO GRASP YOUR ATTENTION AND INTREST. ANY LADIES THINKING G.M IS A GREAT AUTHOR WRITE TO ME VIA E-MAIL.
__label__2	Pretty: I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.
__label__2	"KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!: Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
__label__2	"Yield, America!: Long you have resisted to Kylie, longer than anyone else on the Planet, but the rocking Krafterwerkish ""La, la, la, la"" will sneak behind you and get into your head. It's shall indeed make all the world move. It just must, it is so damn good. Enjoy Kylie, she's back to make Americans unable to get her out of their heads!!!"
__label__1	I'll never understand...: When I first heard this song, I laughed. I thought to myself: Who gave her a record deal, she's just plain bad. Than I read a Teen People Article about how she's been around since the 80's, just not in the U.S. But, it didn't change my opinion. Teen People claimed she's bigger than Madonna in the U.K., why? She can hardly sing, her song is bad, I mean, she's not even pretty.Kylie Minogue, is an insult to pop music and a waste of air time on the radio, and that's all.
__label__2	Great movie!: This is a classic Mary Kate & Ashley movie. The sisters trade places in order to help their dad win the soccer tournament and to help themselves since one sister likes playing soccer more than the other. Their dad in this movie is played by Eric Lutes, who later again stars as their dad in the short lived series So Little Time.This is a great movie for tween girls, I loved every minute of these MK&A; movies when I was a tween!
__label__1	The Olsens' movies are just getting more and more pathetic!: I'm very, very sorry to say this, but THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS. THERE IS NO PLOT, NO MORAL LESSON, NO NOTHING. I can understand the part how Sam and Emma switch teams because they were upset with how they were placed, but after that it was like, hello? Where's the rest of the story? The acting was pretty good but the actual plot (or lack of it) totally stunk!
__label__2	Robert Clark and the Olsen twins: I saw this movie and i thought that the twins were really good.But,I really like the way that Robert Clark played Helmet Head.Keep showing more movies with him.
__label__2	Really good and even interesting for adult viewing.....: My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!
__label__2	Switching Goals is OK...: It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others.
__label__1	"Too Typical: You think that since these girls had done so many movies, they would have least done something more original than the ""twin"" switch. They would not have been as successful as they are if they were not born twins, but they should still be more creative. I did not like this movie, and the acting was not good at all. It was a huge disappointment."
__label__2	HAPPY: the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.
__label__2	The Best: As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.
__label__1	Pretentious: Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious.
__label__2	"I didn't fall asleep. That's a good sign!: Okay, I had to read this book for school. From the description on the back I didn't think that it would be very interesting. I was wrong. It held my attention with it's colorful words and characters and kept me guessing about some characters. Anyway, overall it was a very good book. I only wish that the ending was developed more and wasn't one of those ""use your imagination"" endings."
__label__2	Quick read: Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston.
__label__2	True Bionic Serum: The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum
__label__2	great service: I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again.
__label__2	Well worth the price!: This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital.
__label__2	Exceptionally good analysis of consumer debt issues: The author helped launch the first credit card in the 1950's. He describes in detail the many bad things that have happened from Americans becoming too reliant on plastic, living beyond their means. Should be required reading for all high school students!!!!
__label__2	ladies citizen: My wife loves it. Got it for her as a gift. She says co-workers compliment her on it. I like the eco-drive technology from citizen, its cool that you dont have to ever worry about a battery. As for keeping time.. this is dead on, just like my Eco-drive.
__label__2	I Love this watch thanks amazon !: This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.
__label__1	Buyer BEWARE: This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase
__label__1	There's gold in that there cave: A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents.
__label__2	"Unforgettable: ""I hope this book will never be read."" So begins Yourcenar's Fires...a richly dense collection of famous myths and legends stunningly revitalized through the voices and eyes of the heroines. Intertwining the stories are excerpts from Yournenar's own journal taken from the time during which she had written the stories. Achingly familiar to anyone recovering from a broken heart, Yourcenar marries the heartache of this century's woman to women throughout the ages."
__label__2	stories of the spirit: this is a beautiful book. the one i had for years got compromised by the mold damage we had in our old home so had to be thrown out. since this was one of my favourite books -- of course i had to get another one.
__label__2	Excellent sound: The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it.
__label__2	"I own one and I want another!!!: I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Now they are out of stock and I can't find one. For the price, this product delivers fine sound. I agree with some previous reviewers on the issue of the battery, but that is a minor point. I love the sound!!! It also has good radio reception for stations that are at the fringe of the FM reception band. I did not buy it as a clock radio, but as a less expensive alternative to Bose. At $400 less than the comparable Bose, I say ""go for it'! I hope it is available soon."
__label__1	Definitive of what?: A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work.
__label__1	"How could this happen.....: Jefferson Starship at the time(1983)had released 3 outstanding albums, Freedom at Point Zero, Modern Times, Wind of Change. If anyone had the opportunity to see the band with drummer Ansley Dunbar, You know how disappointing this video is. Unfortunately, when listening to songs like ""Stranger"" you could hear the bands new drummer(???)the mistakes and missed drum fills. It's a shame that the band never released any Video performance of the band with Dunbar. It's a good mix of song selection. Too bad they didnt fine tune the playing.(Why didnt they play ""Save Your Love"" ""Lightening Rose"" ""RockMusic"")"
__label__1	This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha
__label__1	A classic book sold by weight not content: Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example: p50. Q6. Which of the following acids are polyprotic? Acetic; Sulphuric; Hypochlorous; Nitric; all of the above. Answer: Carbonic! PLEASE! Chemistry is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse.
__label__1	Most horrendous test prep book in press...: Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel.
__label__1	This book is a Travesty: With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?
__label__1	Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks.
__label__1	sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort.
__label__1	Wish I could give zero stars: Avoid this book at all costs. It contains numerous errors, misleading items, and misspellings. In the example problems, many of the answers are worked out to find something other than what the original question asked (i.e. oxidation state instead of coordination number). I suggest the author, Monique Laberge, allow someone else to write the next edition.
__label__1	nothing but errors in this book: I agree completely with the other reviews of this book. I just spent an hour deriving and re-deriving the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The previous review tells me what I need to know -- it is incorrect in this book!!! There are so many errors that it is actually more work to review material that I already know than it was to learn it the first time. It's a shame I can't give zero stars on this review.
__label__1	I could have written a better book myself: The author's alleged PhD is quite polemical. I think it averaged an error per page or so. For the 15 minutes I glanced it over, I think I became dumber.
__label__1	Monkies on typewriters: You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes.
__label__1	Not so good: I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers.
__label__1	This book is the worst you could use for your GRE prep: This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it.
__label__2	"New to collecting? This will help.: Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the ""Exploration and Travel"" chapter instead of the ""Tobbaco"" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."
__label__2	Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference...: This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!
__label__2	Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards. Information is given on the history of the cards as well as many examples. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in collecting or just want to know more about Victorian cards.
__label__2	AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana
__label__1	"sloppy: I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
__label__1	Consider American Made Products: Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American.
__label__1	Knock off: This is just a knock off of crocodile dentist. It comes from China, and was already broken. The package was so beat up, I couldn't even give it as a gift. Also, it doesn't work. It just snaps every 2nd tooth, and sometimes the teeth don't pop up. This is a very small version as well, the description doesn't tell you it's travel size.
__label__1	Item seemed like it was used not a new product!: Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
__label__1	"Cheaply made: I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
__label__1	"do not waste your money: i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
__label__1	Broken right out of the box: I wasn't expecting much, but was disappointed that this game didn't even survive shipping. It didn't work right out of the box. The mouth won't close as it should (which is the whole point of the game). I'm a speech therapist and thought this would be a cute game for my students, but it's going back as it's a piece of junk.
__label__1	Knock Off: I am upset to see that this is a knock off. How is it legal for them to sell this? I guess amazon does not care to protect it's buyers...
__label__1	"crap: This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
__label__2	"Great for young kids: I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
__label__2	Fun toy!: I got this for my 4 yr old for Christmas. I thought it would be bigger then it is so it ended up being a stocking stuffer but it is still super fun. It ended up being a good size because we can put it in a backpack to take on trips or to the doctors office to him occupied. The best part of the game is the anticipation on when it is going to snap closed adds to the excitement. The only down side is the head will snap off if it's opened too hard which happen with a 4 yr old sometimes but it's easy to put back on.
__label__1	pinches fingers: My son got this last year for his fourth birthday. He only played it a few times when it slammed down and somehow pinched his fingers hard enough to make him cry. He never wanted to play the game again, I ended up getting rid of it. There are too many other fun and safe games out there to bother with this one.
__label__1	horrible!: this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it.
__label__1	very small and lasted about 1 hour: I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)
__label__2	Cheap, fun toy: This is a fun toy and better than I expected. It is not very durable and sometimes the teeth stick down, but overall it is enjoyable. My older daughter loves to play with me, but it is even easy enough for my 1yr old to play too. It's also small enough for the younger one to hold. Their surprise when the mouth snaps shut is adorable.
__label__2	"Cute but overpriced: I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."
__label__2	I love this toy!: I am a Speech Therapist and this is a toy that the children with whom I work (3,4, and 5 year olds) ask for over and over again. They just love it! I have the small travel one which is perfect since I travel all around for my job. If the child is too afraid to push the teeth down I give him/her a tongue depressor or my pencil so the crocodile bites that instead of the child.
__label__1	Not what I expected: When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game.
__label__1	Not as durable as I thought it would be.: The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way.
__label__2	"quick reflexes!: I've used this game with kids of all ages, including children with special needs. It's a good idea to demo the game first to show them what happens (and the unpredictability). Kids that have issues getting their finger ""bitten"" can use a pencil or popsicle stick to press down the teeth. The end result is always lots of laughs. On the adult front, it could be a good drinking game :)"
__label__1	Fun, but fragile: My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again.
__label__1	"Just OK: I guess it's my own fault for not really reading the description, but this thing is TINY. Was fun enough but the kids (3 & 4) figured out which tooth was the ""bad"" one after @ 30 seconds of playing with it. Not worth the money."
__label__2	Cute!: Bought this for my 3 yr old boy, but my 6 yr old boy likes playin with it too. My younger boy is a little afraid of the mouth snapping shut but still likes to play with it. They did figure out that the tooth that causes the mouth to close is harder to push so its easy to cheat. So we made a rule that once you touch it, you gotta push it! :) I would recommend this toy, its fun.
__label__1	broken in days: I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!
__label__2	Great for playdates, but a bit fragile: We are on our third crocodile dentist! It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE. But I carry it to the park in a large toy bag and the past two copies have broken...when you press a tooth it won't stay down anymore. A good way around this might be to keep it in a box of it's own.This is also a wonderful toy for parents following the RDI Steve Gutstein social therapy for children with Autism. Because this toy has an element of surprise, as you press each tooth you never know if this is the tooth that will cause the jaw to snap shut! Note: the snapping shut is fairly gentle and safe for preschoolers!
__label__1	Piece of junk: It broke, I swear, the second time my child touched the teeth. I have never seen a toy do that. Maybe I just got a lemon.
__label__1	Travel Sized --- Not what I expected: So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result.
__label__1	Doesn't work! Cheaply made.: Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.
__label__1	WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY: I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
__label__2	Fun for Tots and Preschoolers: We just got this for our 2 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 year old. They love it. The 2 year old is a little scared but he will play sometimes and he really likes to watch. The 4 year old loves it, especially if you make your reaction to the gater bites dramatic.
__label__1	Doesn't work: I bought this game for my children at Christmas and it didn't work from the second we pulled it from the package. The teeth get stuck and the mouth doesn't close most of the time. I didn't return it because it would cost more to deal with than I paid for it. Maybe I just got a bad one, who knows. My kids still play with it (they are only 3) but not the way it was meant to be played with. I would recommend just going with the full sized one, not the travel size.
__label__2	Great fun, no pieces: I am a dental hygientist and this toy is the hit with kids from 2 thru 15!! I give it 5 stars, somehow it found its way home with a patient and now I am so glad I found it again.
__label__2	Cheap, Entertaining Toy for Preschoolers: I bought this when my twins were 3 1/2. It was a cheap item, there are no pieces to lose, and it's simple enough that the girls can play together. If they want you to play with them, the game is very quick. The top jaw has fallen off a few times but I think this was my girls' fault - too rough with it - and each time, I've snapped it back on.
__label__2	Fun but short lived: I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!
__label__1	Travel Toy: I was VERY disappointed with this toy. This is not a full size toy but rather a travel toy. I could not believe how small this was for the price I paid (around $13.00). I will be checking to see what the return policy is on this item. I would NOT recommend if you are looking for an actual game for more than one child to play.
__label__2	Fragile: This toy broke within the first two minutes that I took it out of the box. My son is 4 years old and has had most of his toys for a long time and is not particulary destructive, so I was surprised after reading all the reviews for it- how great it was-- you could imagine my disapointment. I do not give this toy a favorble reccomendation.
__label__1	Crocodile Doom: The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little.
__label__1	"May not appeal to toddler: My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
__label__1	Broken right out of the box: At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
__label__1	Cheap Plastic: This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
__label__1	"Instantly broke: We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
__label__1	Very small, flimsy and not working properly: Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same.
__label__1	disappointed: We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
__label__1	Not enough info: The description didn't say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Doesn't work that great, either.
__label__1	Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
__label__1	Horrible Quality: This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking.
__label__1	doesn't live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back.
__label__1	piece of junk: We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
__label__1	This Toy is JUNK!!!: I bought this toy for my Grandson for Christmas, because he asked for it. I was looking for the original Crocodile Dentist game by Milton Bradley, but they are few and far between and expensive. So I got this this. When it arrived I was shocked by how small it was and how cheap it looked!! On Christmas day my Daughter called me and said the thing did NOT work. The teeth would go down, and never come back up!!! So it is as cheap as it looks. This thing is going back, and I would NOT recommend this to anybody!!!! IT IS JUNK!!!! Bring back the original Milton Bradley game!!!!
__label__1	Cute Concept, broke within 5 minutes: I purchased this toy for my 3 year old nephew, who absolutely loves crocodiles. I personally opened it and played with him. Half of the teeth went down and never came back up. The head never even snapped down. I wouldn't recommend this toy, as cute as it looks.
__label__1	fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing.
__label__1	cute idea, but not worth it, save your money: Cute idea, but toy is cheaply made and doesn't work most of the time. Not worth it, save your money.
__label__2	Silly Stupid Fun!: We bought this as a clearance item for a lot cheaper than what it's selling for on Amazon. This toy has been dropped, sat on, stepped on, etc. In other words, it survived a toddler and a little boy. It's so stupid it's fun. We've had a great time with it.
__label__1	Not what I was hoping for...: This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid.
__label__1	Boring...: the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust.
__label__2	*: Played game with 4 year old students- they loved it. It kept them guessing and were surprised every time.
__label__2	Exciting Kid Toy: I could sense the heart pumping excitement builds up every time my 4 year old play this game. He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic. This is a great toy in a dentist's waiting area.
__label__1	Scary: I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years
__label__1	Disappointed: I was disappointed in this toy. It was a travel size and I was expecting a bigger size. I had seen the larger version and was really looking forward to giving it to my daughter. As is turns out, she was a little scared of it anyway, so she probably would have really been scared of the larger one. Anyway, it is a great toy, but I would prefer the larger version.
__label__1	Disapointed: WARNING! THIS IS NOT THE CROCODILE DENTIST GAME THAT YOU GREW UP WITH! I had the idea to buy Crocodile Dentist for a Christmas present for a five year old boy. I remember playing the game when I was younger and I loved it! (the original toy has teeth that you pull out of the croc's mouth and the crocodile was atleast 3 times larger then this pewny little thing). Not only did they change how you play the game, but the size as well...what a jip...shame on them!
__label__1	Horrible: My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas.
__label__1	Crocodile Dentist: It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale.
__label__2	cute toy: Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
__label__1	This was the worst toy I have ever purchased: This was awful. I guess you get what you pay for!!!!! When we opened for the grand daughters to pay with Christmas Eve, the teeth was sticking and there was no excitement. I was suppose to snap it did nothing.
__label__1	Disappointed: My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (books about going to the dentist, the books Open Wide and Dr. DeSoto, ...) so we were really hoping this toy would get his attention too. However, it is just not very entertaining and it is also very fragile. The teeth would get stuck from the first day we opened it and after dropping it a couple of times, it broke apart, so we are no longer able to use it anyway.Unfortunately, this toy was a dud at our home.
__label__2	Best game of all time: If you are looking for something fun for any age, look no further. You simply must play it, you will be as addicted as we are.
__label__1	Purchased twice-never worked: My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
__label__1	"awful: I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
__label__1	Broke after a week: A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money.
__label__1	unhappy: don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money
__label__2	crowd pleaser: This is a small game - easy to pack and take anywhere. It is a lot of fun for kids all ages. My 5 year old recieved it at Christmas but it was played all day by kids younger and older. It gets a laugh every time. The jaw came undone once - but was easy to put back together. It's nice to see the kids enjoy such a simple game among all the techie toys they recieved.
__label__1	"Don't waste your money: This is a knock off of the real toy. It came in a weird box and the toy was rattling around, not even tied down. It already looked played with. The box had several odd phrases on it like the toy is ""elegant"". What??!! Obviously a foreign knock off - and a cheap one at that!"
__label__1	"NOT the Crocodile Dentist you think you're getting. China replica.: I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
__label__1	broken when I opened the box: When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it.
__label__2	Best Chocolate bar ever: This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
__label__2	Cheap and works really well!: Bought a pair of these after reading about a little DIY someone did with the SonySony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and adding a crossover to them. Was an incredibly straight forward install and so far I'm really pleased with the noticeably richer sound I'm getting. I'm a college student on a budget which is why I went with the Sony's in the first place but these cross overs definitely stayed in budget and were worth the purchase.I was contemplating making my own cross over but gave in to the simplicity.Also wanted to note that these shipped very quickly, arrived 3 days after ordering and they made a very far journey.
__label__1	Beautiful music, lousy packaging: I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing.
__label__2	"He Had a Great Voice: Matt Monro had a great voice. It's a shame that he never reached greater status in the United States for having such a gift. There are 36 songs on this album and they are all good. His ""From Russia With Love"" vocal from the James Bond film is a classic."
__label__2	The Mennonite Hymnal: I collect old hymnals and lived in Mennonite country for a few years. 606 is the Mennonite Doxology. It's an awesome arrangement that is sung so beautifully a capella by the Mennonites. So glad to have my own copy of this!
__label__1	Tedious Reds under the beds stuff: Mr Drury's earlier novels are well received (Advise and Consent, particularly). I won't be bothering to read any more after this rather tedious 'The Russian's are coming to get us' effort. We all know now how that turned out. I will say that is slightly more believable than 'Red Dawn', slightly.
__label__2	its nice: I was replacing my old cook book & I thought this was the same one but it isn't but it is a nice cook book.
__label__2	Best show you've never seen: This is the last good show that MTV ever made. Unfortunately, they only lasted one season; by the time it aired, MTV's audience had become too stupid to keep this show afloat. Suffice to say that the show is excellent, and nonstop laughs. It is very clever, and I have purchased a copy for myself, and continue to purchase more, to give out as gifts for xmas and birthdays.
__label__2	"So Sad...: How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show? Leave it to Mtv to can something as great as this in favor of dreck like ""My Super Sweet Sixteen."" They should be ashamed of themselves (well, they should've been ashamed of themselves long before this, but that's besides the point).Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Ghandi & JFK (along with a host of others)... cloned... in high school...Very well-written... great voice casting (Will Forte, Nicole Sullivan, Michael McDonald)... a great show that didn't get a chance, thanks to a once great network that has gone down the pooper."
__label__2	"Hilarious!: So many clever references in this show. I love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist. It's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about JFK sleeping with ""Catherine-the-Not-So-Great"" that I get the giggles and end up watching another episode when I thought I could just watch one."
__label__2	Greatest animated show ever: This is the best animated series ever. I found it originally on Youtube and fell in love with it. I'm so pissed that it's cancelled. The show is a comedy blendin slapstick and paroding teen dramas. the cast itself is enough to make you laugh. the DVD is in great condition by it and maybe just maybe the show will come back.
__label__2	"Amazing: Loved this show eight years ago, still loving it now. It is very tongue in cheek, literally and figuratively. I can't decide if my favorite episode is ""Litter Kills"" or ""Makeover, Makeover, Makeover: The Makeover Episode."" They're both so awesome. Buy it, watch it, love it. It's amazing."
__label__2	I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found...: This book saved my grade in Constitutional Law. A week before the final I was so confused and lost in the material and I was freaking out! I bought this book as a last hope at saving my grade, and not only did it save my grade, I got one of the best grades in the class!! This is the BEST supplement I have seen yet that explains and ties everything together. I would recommend it a thousand times over to all law students who need a little (or a lot) of help with Constitutional Law.
__label__1	Ultra-bad sound quality: This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!
__label__2	Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that...
__label__2	Classic Bowie and Ronson: This is one cool but dated video. It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson, deceased, available. It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era. It's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear. It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder.
__label__2	glam rock at it's best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog.
__label__1	I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible. It must have been wonderful to be at Hammersmith Odeon when this concert was performed, but it sure didn't translate well onto film. Listen to the recordings and skip this disaster.
__label__2	"Stardust Memories: If you like all that pre-grunge grunge dressed up in outlandish costumes and enough make-up to cause Angela Bowie blush, you'll David and the Spiders ripping their way through their hits and a couple of covers including Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"" and Lou Reed's ""White Light, White Heat.""Grungy and gaudy before either were cool!"
__label__1	"Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
__label__1	"Where in the world is the original mix?: I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."
__label__2	A nice DVD: I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie.
__label__1	disappointing: One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. But, after making all the adjustments I could think of I could not make the sound (or video for that matter) quality acceptable. As much as I adore David Bowie, I haven't even been able to watch this even once all the way through. I did notice that the favorable reviews were for the VHS version of this film. Too bad, such potential!
__label__1	Agree with Maltin: I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. Pennebaker obviously had a very low budget, and probably the film sat around for years before he pieced it together in a lame moment. I enjoyed seeing the different costume changes most...
__label__1	"You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd...: As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
__label__1	"Ziggy stardust & the DVD from the rubbish bin: I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it""s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it."
__label__2	Camera work not 100% but great music all the same.: I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful. But you have to consider how difficult it is to film at a live concert in the dark. At some points, the camera does shake and it becomes hard to see Ziggy. However, the music ROCKS! And it is definitely worth buying! I watch it ALL THE TIME!
__label__2	The Best Book In The World!!: I have read over 100 books, but none as fabulous as this one. I know, I know, it's just a pony pals book! But this book had real meaning. I don't know why Angela or whoever is complaining about nothing bad ever happing to them, because that was exactly what happened in this book. The Pony Pals go away to a riding clinic. No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!! This book was very touching and helped me realize that ponies are just as good as horses, if not better.
__label__2	My nephews love them!: I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don't fight with one another. My only complain is the flashlight, very poor quality. The light keeps going off and on, even with a new battery. I think it's a connection problem. Aside from that... my nephews love them.
__label__2	More plastic toys, but they'll have fun...: My 4 yr old is really into hunting so this is perfect for him right now. Yeah, it's more plastic that will eventually break and the binoculars arent anything great but he doesnt know that. I think it will get lots of use especially from his own imagination. Cant beat that!
__label__1	"pretty but delicate: this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
__label__2	Mystical truth accessible to everyone!: What an awesome book! Author Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism. It was amazing to read the ways so many different people can come to experience the divine.What sets this apart from so many spiritual books is it brings divinity down to earth wihtout losing the divinity!And finally, a spiritual writer who finds a way to be honest and real, herself. Not an ounce of pretension!!!
__label__2	Great dada from the Bonzos!: Having heard most of the Bonzos' catalog (or catalogue, if you're in the UK), off of assorted collections and the Cornology boxed set, I leaped at the chance to own the original CD's (and this was the last one I purchased), because of the bonus tracks. As always, Neil Innes provides sharp and witty banter recounting the history of how the Bonzo tracks came into existence, and the music never fails to delight, especially 'The Craig Torso Show' where I would have nearly fell about laughing if I wouldn't have been in the car ('Craig Torso smells wonderfuuuuuuul'). Minus one star for again mis-labelling Sidney Nicholls (aka Big Sid, the guy playing banjo in the numbered group shot) as Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell.
__label__1	Beware: I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. It does not say this clearly in the product description
__label__2	An Excellent Gift: I was given this book as a Christmas gift by a very good friend. She is American, I'm a Scot and, at first, I wondered why she was sending me a book called Inheriting Scotland. Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance.
__label__1	Not as expected: Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one.
__label__1	Color is not expresso!: We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
__label__2	Beautiful music: Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. If I had not seen the movie, I would never have heard his compositions. This album would be loved by anyone who is moved by Celtic music. Beautiful!
__label__2	The Shipping News: I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound.
__label__2	love this movie!: This is a great movie with an excellent cast and a beautiful score. I watch it over and over! Some of the scenes are a little bit gruesome, but they are somewhat necessary for the story.
__label__2	Great performance!: This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD. I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc. I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect.
__label__1	"Adds very little to the online docu: This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: ""In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)."" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."
__label__1	Falls far short of expectations.: The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent.
__label__1	Save your money.: Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation.
__label__1	This book could have been something special...: It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own.
__label__1	Good only for the beginners.: This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself.
__label__2	Scott: While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.
__label__1	forget it for linux: The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground.
__label__1	Stick with the on-line docs: Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken
__label__1	All this information is online.: This was the only Tomcat book available at the time I was looking, so I decided to pick it up to enhance my knowledge. However, almost all the information I found in it was available, sometimes verbatim, online.
__label__1	"this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects"": If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
__label__2	Best book on the subject: (...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource.
__label__1	Not nearly enough detail: It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat.
__label__2	Great Text.: Finally a text that goes beyond the high school like documentation packaged with Tomcat. I found everything I needed. I especially found value in the Chapters on deploying other Jakarta technologies into the Tomcat container.Great text.
__label__1	"Good lord! one of the WORST books out there!: I've read a quite a few technical books and by far, this one tops the list as being THE worst book I've ever read. Too much information missing, makes many assumptions that you know what you're doing. (If I knew what I was doing with Tomcat, why would I need the book?) Unbelievable. HORRIBLE is a word that comes to mind (among many others that would be ""bleeped"" off of here.)"
__label__1	Worthless: I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail.
__label__1	Incomplete and not thourough: This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today.
__label__2	Great Book, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration: I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James.
__label__1	too expensive: The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
__label__2	Great product, worth the nasty taste: It took me a while to get used to the flavor: very bitter. I put it in a little bit of water then wash it down with a whole lot of water, every evening. I notice a huge difference in my sleep, among other things. I highly recommend it!
__label__1	Cinematic satire is dead: Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything.
__label__1	Yes, this is a lame=weird movie: 1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting.
__label__1	God, This Movie's A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie.
__label__1	ridiculously overrated campy trash: Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap.
__label__1	YYYYAAAAWWWWNNNN: What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I read. I guess I should have read more of them, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie a total bore.I was hoping it would get better, maybe a surprise scene in the middle or the end of the movie but it never happened!That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back.
__label__1	Bad, bad, boring, bad: I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie.
__label__1	Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust.
__label__1	Waste of Money: It was a waste of money. In my opinion, it was just shy of being labeled a porno film.
__label__2	GET THE DVD BY ALL MEANS: The DVD has one of the best director's and actor's comments I have ever seen on a DVD.McLellan's performance is beyond positive description (did I spell his name right?).
__label__2	"Stunning and brilliant: I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""
__label__2	Tender, wonderful movie: I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. Ian McKellan is just wonderful. The scene where he talks about the loss of his friend in WWI is so moving. The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again.
__label__2	An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection.
__label__2	Ian McKellen shines hauntingly.....: What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !
__label__2	"Ian MacKellan was robbed at the Oscars!: He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded movie director James Whale (directed ""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and the 1936 ""Showboat"", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Instead of being turned off by his penchant for young boys, you felt sorry for him. Sir Ian was more worthy of the Best Actor Oscar than Benigni. Also excellent work by Lynne Redgrave and even Brendan Fraser. I would recommend this video to anyone!"
__label__2	"Good Movie: Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies. Knew little about ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale, but movie gives much insight."
__label__2	Hollywood Queens and then some: A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?
__label__1	"Why?: I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."
__label__1	Boring,,,: Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man...
__label__1	"A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.: First, forget anything about ""Frankenstein."" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled ""God, This Movie's A Monster!""For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."
__label__2	Tender, Beautiful, and crack-me-up funny!!: This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
__label__2	Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!: This movie has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!
__label__1	"I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....: This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying ""who cares?"" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."
__label__2	"A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called ""Father of Frankenstein,"" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you."
__label__2	More than perfect: This movie is a masterpiece. IMHO, it is flawless in every aspect. Words cannot describe how wonderful these actors are. Ian McKellen has definitely dominated the show. He is like a beautiful centerpiece that is made of diamond. I couldn't move my eyes away from him. And Brendan Fraser is equally good; his strength is not a bit weaker than his counterpart. That is admirable. Finally, Lynn Redgrave, she has shone through the whole movie. She's perfect. The story telling is magically, the director, the screenwriter, the musician; the whole production team has done an incredible work to bring this tragedy story to live. These people are brilliant; they know their stuff; they know life; there is no doubt about that. What amazes me is that they also have a loving heart and that makes this movie extra special.
__label__2	"A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent: This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray."
__label__2	"good: I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a ""strong type "" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!"
__label__2	Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character. She plays it pretty drab inside and out.
__label__1	Boring, boring, boring!: Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along.
__label__2	Brad Renfro films are always good.: I missed this title when it was in theaters. I have learned to appreciate Brad Renfro. Too bad, like Charlie Sheen, he was hooked on drugs but at a younger age.
__label__1	No details = NO sale!: First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash....
__label__1	POOR SUPPORT: I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support
__label__1	Not Thrilled: I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. After you hit the ball there is a streak that follows the ball. I found this annoying. I ended up taking it off my computer and found a different game that I like MUCH better. I'm glad I didn't pay a whole lot for this. It was disappointing.
__label__2	Perfect For Rainy Day Golfing: As a person who frequents the golf course on a weekly basis, I can confidently say that this game may give real golf a run for its money. This game is a wonderful simulation of real life golf. The graphics and control settings are by far more realistic than any other simulated golf game out there. Unlike many other virtual golf game, Prostroke provides players with the ability to simulate the skills needed when playing a real golf game. I found myself angling my body as well as the club. I was even perfecting my footwork for the perfect shot. The game was great. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't always have time to run down to the golf course or just simply feels like hitting a few rounds from the comfort of their own home.
__label__1	don't buy it: it has some nice features and it's too bad that you can't see them. everything is black. the grass is black. the bunkers are black. I can't see anything.
__label__1	don't bother: As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket.
__label__1	Disappointed: I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
__label__1	I did not receive the item: I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
__label__1	"quite bad: I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
__label__2	Sturdy, nice looking: I've had this outside my kitchen door for a couple of months. It's great at cleaning shoes (I do a lot of gardening and yard work), it's holding up well, and the rubber base is very solid.
__label__1	HORRIBLE: I would acttualy give it 0 stars. This book accuses the ming and Qing Emperors as horrible rulers and doesnt mention much about the manchus. it also criticies to much about the Qing Dynasty. Also, the information is OUTDATED/ along woith many words. DO NOT BUY THIS BOKK! DONNT EVEN LOOK AT IT!
__label__2	Realistic Tree: This Xmas tree is a very lifelike and realistic tree and is just what we wanted for our living room! The lights on it are beautiful and the pine cones are a great added effect. Can't wait to put the presents underneath!
__label__2	Christmas Tree, artificial: The GKI/ Bethlehem Ligh Glacier Christmas Tree is the first artificial tree that looks real and fools most of my guests. We saw the same tree at a well known hardware store for double the price. The tree is easy to assemble and even comes with a DVD that explains how to put tree together. The tree comes adorned with pinecones and snow frosted tips. It looks just like the trees we cut near Placerville, CA. It is our first artificial tree and we love it!
__label__2	Great item but very tight fit: This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won't move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal.
__label__1	Trading one bad habit for another: Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!
__label__2	"This is actually better than the Live From New Haven DVD! 13 extra minutes.: I have the Live From New Haven DVD and wasn't very impressed with the audio and picture quality. This VHS has a better picture quality and it sounded better. Not only that but it had back stage footage AND Pat Benatar performing ""Little Paradise"" as the last encore which wasn't shown on the Live From New Haven DVD/ or that 1998 VHS release. Also included was the video Love Is A Battlefield as it was a quick promo for the upcoming LP Live From Earth. I cannot find anywhere where she sings Little Paradise Live so I feel like the lucky few now!"

__label__2	"Babe: Enough said.: One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is cliché, that's what this is."
__label__2	"Excellent Biography: An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. ""Babe"" gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get."
__label__2	"Still The Best: Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first ""serious"" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."
__label__2	"Babe: The Legend Comes To Life: As author of the yet to be published ""Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,"" I have read every book I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth. The more I read, the more I appreciate Creamer's exhaustive account of Ruth's playing career. This one is, by far, the best of all and I keep it with me at all times when I am in need of reference material. It is the most thorough and comprehensive. It is easy to see why this book has endured the test of time - an amazing 33 years in print. Thank you, Robert Creamer, for your truly wonderful contribution, and may you enjoy many more years in print! Sincerely, Rebecca Rau"
__label__2	Babe Ruth learned: As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike
__label__2	Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing.
__label__2	"Good Foundation: I found this book to be packed with great information and recommend it to be added to any PHA library. It not only gives good basic knowledge, but also includes study and research paths which lead into further light and understanding of our craft in modern aspects.""Black Square and Compass"" also shows the correlation and significance of PHA in association with modern black history. For example accomplishments of the Buffalo Soldiers and the network of the Underground Railroad."
__label__2	Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time.
__label__2	worked perfectly!: After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly.
__label__1	Not the best I have: I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. I have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. The stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if I don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. Compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. I regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when I got my small one.
__label__1	very poor quality: This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires.
__label__2	Great Price, Great Product: Love these and easy to use. You really can not put it though twice though if you mess up. I have only used it on a laser printer because that's what it says it's for. Awesome price so I don't wince too much when I mess up. I'll only buy these from now on.
__label__2	Office Max wants $40 for this: It works on my laser printer. Only after receiving the product did I realize there is another type of film made by the same company, specifically for laser printers. This is technically for copiers (same premise, I know).
__label__1	for laser printers only: This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund.
__label__2	Great little known tips: I am an avid gardener who has accumulated many books on the subject. I thought to myself, why do I need one more? I originally took this book out from my local library and enjoyed it so much I wanted to buy it to have it for permanent reference. It covers everything from soil (how and when to test), to all types of plants (flowers, herbs, shrubs,etc). The illustrations are many and help visually guide the reader with steps for things like pruning, staking, composting, etc. The tips are simple and are environmentally friendly. Two things that are important to me. I'd highly recommend this book whether you have one book on gardening or 100.
__label__2	Good service: I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
__label__2	Great photographs.: Ok I'm a little biased on this book, since there is a hundred year old picture of my house in it. But I really loved the old pictures. The whole series of city history books published by this company are very interesting, specially if you live or own a home in the cities.
__label__2	Fantastic show: My husband and I have come to love this show. It is very appropriate for children too. It is so funny and the story line is really well put together. I highly highly recommend.
__label__2	The Review: Kenichi is definitely worth buying. It's full of humor and action, and who doesn't think that a guying being shown up by a female martial artist is funny.
__label__1	Blah......: What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
__label__1	"Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total: I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."
__label__1	This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all. The characters are shallow and the situation is contrived. Reading the entire book was painful, and I would not have continued reading it if it wasn't a book club selection. Save your money and your time. Don't bother reading this book!
__label__2	"We aren't in Kansas anymore: I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
__label__1	Surrender this one: After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library.
__label__2	"Absorbing and Felt Real: This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought ""women's literature"" books for my book club!"
__label__1	Boring,Boring,Boring,,,: How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it.
__label__2	funny and heartbreaking: I loved this book -- it's among Wolitzer's best. The writing is sharp, funny and epigrammatic, the characters rich, the plot full of twists and turns. I can't wait for the movie!
__label__1	Would not buy were I you: The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing. I did not like at all. Was there even an editor? If you desperately want to give it a try, borrow somewhere (not that you'll find it in the library).... just don't buy it!
__label__1	Disappointed: I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
__label__1	Left me cold: Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on.
__label__2	Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!: Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human.
__label__2	"Big Chill in Little London: A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."
__label__1	A little disappointed...: Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-(
__label__2	"For those who like word of mouth cult movies...: and especially British underground cult movies, check out ""Final Cut"" - and then ""Love, Honour & Obey"" (the sequel, written by the same two guys, and featuring the same set of actors). The first time I saw ""Final Cut"" back in 98 I was gripped by the edgy, rawness of this ""reality movie"" format, and the shear thought-provoking nature of the film. (I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the ""Primrose Hill"" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!)."
__label__1	Trash Pure and Simple: This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy. A complete piece of rubbish.
__label__2	For professionals only: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques.
__label__1	Not as well-made as I'd hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it.
__label__1	"Not up to expectations.: I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!) He warns that not all ""outlets"" really offer great bargains -- but you have to check 'em all out yourself to find out which ones do.And guess what -- he says you can get great prices at Sams, KB Toys, and Tuesday Morning. Well, ""duh""."
__label__2	Everything I ever wanted to know: This dictionary is the best medical dictionary I've come across. It's full of illustrations and makes searching for things easy.
__label__2	Mosbys medical dictionary: Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures.
__label__2	mosby's dictionary: it's been very helpful, i'm taking medical coding and there are things i did not know so i looked it up and was very helpful. i will continue using it.
__label__2	Better Lucky than Smart: I ordered Tabers Cyclopedic guide first, but it arrived with some pages damaged in binding. And it seemed compressed in size and with its explanations. So I sent it back (thank you damage) and switched to Mosby's. Hooray! Bigger & better & more thorough with LOTS of pictures. The words searched for are printed in blue, with the definitions in black, making it easy to scan for your subject. Lucky me.
__label__2	This dictionary makes looking up words fun.: I bought Mosby's because it's easy to read and look up medical terms. I'm learning the language and this book is formatted for easy readability. The numerous illustrations are all in color which I found informative. It's definitely a user-friendly dictionary.
__label__2	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.
__label__2	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary was bought for my wife studying to become a LicensedMassage Therapist. In the course of her Physiology studies it becameapparent that for the terminology being used required a stronger, moreprecise definition to her study even more than her Physiology book.Thismet her need and has been a tool that will become part of her workinglibrary.Jack Watson
__label__2	Mosby's Medical Dictionary 7th Ed: I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
__label__2	Cap in Terrell, Tx.: I really do like using Mosby's Medical Dictionary because it is an easy print to read. I am currently taking an Internet course in Medical Terminology. When I don't understand a word I quickly look it up in Mosby's Medical Dictionary for more clarification. The graphic pictures are excellent. In addition, I will be purchasing Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary.
__label__1	Much Is Missing: This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. All it came with was the Atlas of Anatomy and the word definitions. So very upset with this purchase.
__label__2	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary is a great resource. It is full of wonderful color pictures and are very interesting. This book has helped me in many of my classes this semester.
__label__2	Easy to understand: I bought this book to compliment my Taber's Medical Dictionary. I'm glad that I did. I found that some of the diseases in Taber's were vague and when I looked them up in Mosby's I found easy to understand definitions with lots of pictures of diseases.
__label__1	I finally found it: My search is over. I have finally found the absolute worst record in the history of recorded sound. These guys are so awful they make the Dead sound like the Vienna Boys Choir. The stuff on this record cannot even be called music. They must have been great at PR, because they had absolutely no ability to make recorded sound at all. I heard that one of them is dead. Good. One down, one to go.
__label__1	"One of the most disappointing Heinlein books: This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the ""gee shucks, we're in the space patrol"" line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."
__label__2	A child's adventure story; an adult's classic: It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real.
__label__2	One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories: This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility
__label__2	A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18: JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad.
__label__1	OOPS!: I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged... Let's just say I strongly recommend you do not use this inside. Your insurance WILL NOT cover any related incident!Oh, the humanity!
__label__2	"DOUBLE MEASURE!: Putting things in perspective is only part of what Eduardo learns as he attempts to ""measure up"" to the RULERS. A super little bilingual story on learning how to prioritize our duties."
__label__1	Mediocrity for our times: The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
__label__1	"Command and Control at the Top: Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles."
__label__1	"Misses the Point: I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as ""amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,"" ""disrupt the natural order of things,"" ""seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,"" ""seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,"" ""time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,"" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
__label__2	Good Godowsky.: These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts. Recording sound also leaves something to be desired.
__label__1	Horrible: I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back.
__label__1	Almost awful product from Borner!: I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. The grater is almost dull, made of very thin metal that bended while sitting in the drawer. The metal blade also fell once, but I managed to insert it back. The handle is uncomfortable due to it sharp shapes. I gave the stars for the other uses, as I successfully managed to open an orange with it. It might also work for other tasks, but not for grating.I can't believe Borner was able to produce such a bad tool. I am not recommending it, as there are many other better graters on the market!
__label__2	Borner Veggie Peeler: I used to have this peeler, but it was misplaced during moving. I used it for good 4 years and it never dulled, rusted, or got out of shape. Perfect quality and materials. I am glad I found it! Thank you, Amazon!
__label__1	"Not Vermont American: You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand ""Do It Best"" crap FROM CHINA. Junk don't buy."
__label__2	"Afterthoughts ... Music for the soul and spirit: In this busy, crazy, and sometimes angry world of ours, it is a gift to relax and listen to Kristi's arrangements of both original and classic music. I found the album a tool for helping me to relax at the end of a hard day, or to listen too simply for the soothing harmonies and flowing tonal art. Add this CD to your collection of ""Music for your Soul and Spirit."""
__label__2	"VERY HARD TO FIND 1982 RELEASES! BUT VERY GOOD ONES!: I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin' this 1982 release every day. ""My Favorite Person"" had all the classic flavor of the O'Jays. Itwas probably their last classic Philly sound release as the problems Philadelphia International would have with CBS Records wouls eventually set in and a move to EMI would be forthcoming. ""Your Body's Here With Me"" is the signature cut on this reissued double album but ""My Favorite Person"", ""I Just Want To Satisfy"", and ""One On One"" were classic cuts as well. ""When Will I See You Again"" dropped great songs with their own version of the classic Three Degrees hit. Check out ""I Can't Stand The Pain"". These two albums are probably the hardest to find of all of the O'Jays albums besides the ones released on the TSOP(The Sound Of Philadelphia) label. PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE ITS NOW ON 1 CD!"
__label__2	Good Bed: Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.
__label__1	Tore within a few days. Heavy bed with 2 cedar bags inside.: This was the worst dog bed I ever purchased. Within the first few days, the fabric tore along the side seam and every time I wanted to move it, the cedar bags fell out of the giant rip. I can't imagine why this wasn't constructed with thicker fabric and industrial stitching. The bed is heavy and awkward to move. Inside are 2 cedar bags and 1 foam pad, so that when you move it, those cedar bags will overlap each other, then the bed has a big lump in it. You have to get those cedar bags side-by-side in there. What a pain! I purchased the large bed, so possibly this is why there were 2 bags. Also, you can only wash the thin outer bag that holds the cedar bags and foam pad inside.
__label__1	Too noisy!: The combination of the cedar and the nylon made this bed incredibly noisy. I had to pick my dog and put her on it, and once she got off of it, she wouldn't go back on. She looked at me like she was being tortured being on it. She did sleep on it for one night but wouldn't go back on it at all. Not exactly the dog bed I had in mind.
__label__1	Great group, poor dvd: Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video.
__label__1	crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007: DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
__label__1	"Santana - Live by Request: War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
__label__1	Nothing New!! Same as SuperNatural but......: Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
__label__2	Still Amazing: Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content.
__label__2	"Nutritious and delicious: Though one reviewer felt the format of this book was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for ""cooked rice"" or ""cooked peas"". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth."
__label__2	Recipes for a Small Planet: Great book for vegetarian recipes. Great for a new vegetarian oranyone who enjoys meatless recipes.
__label__1	Nearly Useless: I've owned this cookbook for years. A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy.
__label__2	Bought it again for our second child!: These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. They have pockets for the photos rather than those electrostatic pages which makes them far easier to use (in my opinion). They also have space to write notes next to each photo. We liked the one we got for our daughter so much, we bought another when we had our son.
__label__2	Good: This is an excellent item. The seller shipped fast and I am 100% satisfied with the overall transaction. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
__label__2	They didn't live happily every after: Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna.
__label__1	Not good: If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing.
__label__2	beautiful dancing: I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to Aradia after seeing how professional she always looks in her magazine photos, but having read all the other reviews, I took a chance and bought this dvd. I can only add to the praise by saying, Aradia took her time and thoughtfully planned all the components of this dvd. Might not be suitable for a beginner, but if you are a beginner, get this dvd anyway so you have it when you are ready for it.
__label__2	So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it.
__label__1	Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!
__label__1	Not true to description!: Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section.
__label__2	Excelente: Manu es una de los mejores cantantes del Operacion Triunfo.Aunque la musica es un poco 'easy listening', este CD es su premera y Manu la hace muy bien y no se falta su voz. Me encanta este chico y creo que el va a hacer mucho mas.
__label__2	Touching, sad, but moving and worth the read: Although many people think that reading such books as these, the accounts of teenagers who died while under the Nazi regime, is depressing...people should tell them, it should be. This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you.
__label__1	I don't like it: IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. no action at all. I had to read it for a school project on the holocaust and I ended up changing my book. I personally thought it wasn't good.
__label__1	We Are Witnesses: When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book.
__label__2	"This is a good book: I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."
__label__1	Ok I guess: This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective.
__label__2	Book=Very GOOD!: I thought this book was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager's lives and the victims of the Holocaust. It was sad to know how well-off Americans in the U.S. and other fortunate people had it then. When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others. But I would have liked it more if he would have described more about what the Nazis would do to the victims after they were transported. Otherwhise, I liked this book very much.
__label__2	"Outstanding CD: I have all 4 cd's - now waiting for the new cd, November 24 ... ""All of the Above"" thank you Brian Maes for some of the best music to come around in years."
__label__2	Caught the fever!: I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony.
__label__1	Sent wrong book: I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
__label__1	A flimsy and heavily biased account of problems in America: Thomas Sullivan attempts to cover a broad array of social problems confronting American society. He addresses race, drugs, crime, social inequality, gender, and many other relevant issues. I found his assessment of these issues superficial often misapplying or incorrectly citing material referenced. His ideology is readily apparent, and throughout most of the book influences his discussion of the issues. Instead of taking an objective and critical look at our social problems, he embarked on a one-sided journey of his personal opinion. Unfortunately, I was required to use this book in a course on Social Issues. I am hopeful that anyone considering this book in the future will see this review and avoid it at all costs.
__label__1	One of the great medieval Jewish poets and thinkers: Solomon ibn Gabriol 1021-1058 is one of the great Jewish medieval poets and thinkers. He lived a difficult life of wandering . His poetry is filled with a strong sense of the majesty of God. And his works are part of the Jewish liturgy.
__label__1	Crack: I gave it to a friend. He put it in the freezer to use that evening and when he pulled it out it was cracked. :( Disappointing.
__label__1	all cracked up: Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn't know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can't get full refund...sad :(
__label__2	AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE: I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
__label__1	"Good beginning, bad ending: This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."
__label__2	A plain and simple NASB...: This Bible is the new updated NASB translation. The translation is accurate, but this particular Bible has only the basics. The print is fairly cramped, and as far as extra perks go, there are a few B&W maps and a small concordance. A good economy Bible to own, but no special frills.
__label__1	Poor quality.: I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore. They have the imitation leather cover. All of the covers have come unbound from the pages. Very poor quality. I love the NASB, but this is just poorly made.
__label__2	NASB: Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand.
__label__2	Fun, suspenseful movie: This DVD is in fine condition and the movie is well done as well as exciting and fun to watch. My husband and I both enjoyed it despite our different tastes when it comes to movies.
__label__1	Why so much?: I've heard of this movie and was interested in picking it up. But can one of youmovie nerds explain why the price for this is so high?
__label__2	"Was he?: The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
__label__2	A Dead Hero!: This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans. It was a clever plot to plant a body with rank, papers, and identification in a location that was backed by information of tides, sea currents, etc. There was the usual anxious feelings of being discovered especially when the Germans decided to send a spy to England to verify whether this person really existed. The plot becomes more tense when he confronts the woman whose picture was found on the body along with a love letter!
__label__2	The Man Who Never Was: Although later historical facts have put a few holes in the details of this CD and the original book, the content was in the main true to the actual happenings. Clifton Webb's acting job was top notch. A good spy stroy based on actual events.
__label__2	A Classic British WWII Film: This film showes the Brits as the Masters of faking out the Crowns Enemies. It also shows that not all the most effective fighting involves fix bayonets and charge.
__label__1	"I'm glad the man never was, I wish the movie never was either!: Adopting the story of operation ""Mincemeat"" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined."
__label__1	"Dull as Lead: Thirty minutes into the film, viewing it in w/s, I ejected the disc. I thought the characters were two-dimensional. I thought the script was hackneyed. I thought the direction was plodding. ""Dam Busters"" held my interest. ""The Man Who Never Was"" did not."
__label__2	Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story: If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time.
__label__2	The Man Who Never Was: This one of the iconic British movies from the 1950's. The story line and the cast were just magnificent. I have watched this movie many times over the years, mainly on late night television. I was surprised that the movie is still available. The story is based on true events from thne 2nd WW and this forgotten hero in one effort did a lot to help shorten the War. His father should be given more recognition for the act of selfless love in donating his Sons body to the war effort.
__label__2	A good quality WWII movie bases on a true story: To think that British Intelligence created this allusion to fool the Nazis during World War II is just magnificent. A ripping good yarn. Well done Amazon.com. This DVD is not released in AUSTRALIA. Making the purchase on line was simple, quick and easy. Regards Mr. T J SOMERVILLE, GAWLER EAST, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA
__label__2	Cheers for The Man Who Never Was: I had always tought of clifton Webb as that weird guy who starred only in The Stars And Stripes For Ever, A 1950's verson of The Titanic and Cheaper By The Dozen. He comes a accross as a brilliant ex attorney, an Hercules Poirot type almost, trying to think one step ahead of the Gerries in this wonderful espionage thriller.True there are no big battle scenes but how all the pieces come together and the tension that builds when the German spy comes to check on things was masterful. Everything fits.I had read the book on this tale at 15 and now at 42 have seen the film for the first time and give it 4 + stars.
__label__2	"An exciting World War II movie: I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
__label__1	Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story: I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print.
__label__1	Live Suprise!: This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. I like some Live music but this is not what I wanted. Order a different one.
__label__1	Wrong item!: After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this.
__label__2	from a doula dad: The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze.
__label__1	"A few good, a lot bad: There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
__label__2	Ballets of the Forties and Fifties described.: For someone interested in the ballets before 1956 and the ballet companies who danced them, this is for you. This is what happened to the ballet world after Diaghilev's death in 1929. Out of this new world were born the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theater) and the New York City Ballet founded by George Balanchine who got his start with Diaghilev's company.
__label__2	Al Green Love and Happiness: This is a classic CD set...I will keep forever and pass on to my kids. Love it!!!!
__label__2	Tight Jam by R.Kelly: this is the direction R.Kelly is going with on his Musical Virus Project.this cut has a cool Jamaican Feel. R.Kelly is channeling elements of Bob Marley&Harry Belefonte on his vocal runs. real smooth joint. this track is so Cool&has a soulful vibe all the way through.I ai't feeling the Re-Mix though. but I like the direction He his taken with going in different directions.this is a Classic Kells Jam.
__label__1	Surface Noise!!!!!!: Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!
__label__1	This Is Crap: If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. Cristina is great but this cd is obviously taken from vinyl and sounds horrible. You can actually hear the record static and the high hats will hurt your ears. I'm going to return mine.
__label__2	"It was a fiction book...: I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book. Keep it close to you. It will happen...""England will be the World Cup Champion again."
__label__1	Way too many ads: In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read.
__label__2	Men's Fitness: Men's Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. It was easy to read on the kindle fire also.
__label__2	fitness: It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
__label__1	Cancelled Subscription: I've been a long time subscriber to Men's Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. I have an android based tablet with the Kindle App and it would be great to read online and keep previous issues without taking up space. Unfortunately, Amazon/Men's Fitness does not support their Android based Kindle app, so I cancelled the subscription.
__label__2	"Great magazine: Loaded with workout tips and guides (even if you think you know it all). Focuses on working out and not on the normal crud that fills the others - if I wanna know ""10 pickup lines that work 90% of the time, every time"" then I can pickup one of those other magazines that by the title you'd think would be focusing on working out, but is filled with fluff!"
__label__1	Six months past, I never get the magazine.: I never get my magazine, it turns out to be the company got the wrong address. So i have to wait another 4~5 months to get my magazine. I can't get my magazine until June or July. Making me so upset!
__label__1	Don't Order this product: The magizine itself was good with the one issue they sent. I only received one issue then did not receive another. I ordered in June and now it's September. I received one Magazine. I contacted Men's Fitness Customer Support who said they would reply in 24-48 hours and it's now been a week in a half with nothing. I used to receive Men's Health and I am now going to make the switch. It's more money, but they actually show up each week. Very bad Customer Service. I would not recommend this to anyone.
__label__1	Awful Service: Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
__label__2	Not as good as it once was: I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars.
__label__1	Its all shell.: This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing.
__label__1	"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.: Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
__label__1	Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer: I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
__label__1	"Don't waste your time: I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
__label__1	"Really bad!: This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
__label__1	Not good: This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. I was disapointed, would not reccomend getting this book
__label__1	Required for course: This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover.
__label__2	"Hidden Gem!!: After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"
__label__1	Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN: This is by far the worst book I have ever read on this topic. People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good.
__label__1	False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually.
__label__1	An abomination: I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas.
__label__2	Review of False Intimacy: The book, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it's content is truly amazing and informative. Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!
__label__2	Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band .
__label__2	Great DVD: I have had the video tape of this Roxy Music performance for years. I watched it a lot but the tape was old and I was very pleased to find it on DVD in its origional form. If you like Roxy Music this is a 5 star performance.
__label__1	doesn't come with what's pictured......: Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised.
__label__2	"Thought Provoking...Interesting: This book raises questions of conspiracy with its story of how history is altered according to the times and whims (?) of the few. I recommend this book for anyone studying history, and anyone who wants to know ""the truth."""
__label__1	Meh.: Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys.
__label__1	totally unnecessary: this product is ridiculous... all you need to remove garlic smell from hands is to rub your hands on ANY stainless steel item under running water. just about any knife in your kitchen will work, as will pots, cutlery, the sink itself, etc.
__label__1	I don't think this works...: I bought 4 of these to distribute as gifts to my mother, sister, sister in law and myself. We all cook with tons of garlic and I thought it would be the perfect gift. We tried using the eggs after a day of intense cooking and it didn't seem to work. Ours hands still smelled of garlic and onions.
__label__2	"Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno: Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
__label__2	Handy lil mp3 player: I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have.
__label__1	"Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
__label__2	"Delivers what it promises.: Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, ""Creative Projects."" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the ""Tickle me Lego"" toy, to fun things for adults like ""Machine with Minifig,"" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation. I especially liked the internet resources listed in the back.CONS:Projects are not laid out in step-by-step detail in the book. (They are on the CD-ROM)."
__label__1	Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided: I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT.
__label__1	Character sheets with different pictures: Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in.
__label__2	great material hampered by poor layout: Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read.
__label__1	"Poor scholarship: This book is another example of ""hands-off"" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources. In summary, in deciding whether to purchase this book---pass!"
__label__2	Helpful Book on Pastors Changing Churches: Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person. Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject.
__label__2	Good To Go: This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album.
__label__1	Predictable and Unrealistic: I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
__label__2	most intense book i've ever read !!!: I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
__label__2	One of the all time best reads ever!: I read this maybe 20 years ago, and have to read it again. SOOO good, so intense, scary, awesome!! Great plot twist. It should have been a bestseller!!
__label__1	"Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny: I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
__label__2	Disturb not the dream: I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
__label__2	Old favorite: i first read this book back in the 1980s and loved it. Unfortunately, I lent the book to a friend and never got it back. Always wanted to read it again but I could never find it in any stores. Was able to find it on Amazon, ordered it and thoroughly enjoyed rereading it.
__label__2	From the lyrics to the chords, this album is full of talent: These Anaheim boys know how to rock my world. Their music is upbeat, fun and easy to dance to. I definitely recommend checking it out and while you're at it, check out their website (mysuperhero.com) If you like music with style you'll love My Superhero!!!
__label__2	This book should be on our shelves as Pastors: I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best.
__label__2	Awesome baby prunes!: My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
__label__2	Historical and family content a MUST READ!!!: I loved this book. It has a great historical content to the founding of our nation, as well as the beginning of the LDS church. It has photos and letters spanning four generations, and amazing stories throughout. I particularly loved the letters during the war of 1812. For our family, it's particularly a touching memoir as it is our direct ancestor line. It is not only a must read, but we are purchasing additional copies for our children to have when they are grown. Beautifully written, and well researched. It doesn't get better than this!
__label__1	Do not read this book!: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated.
__label__1	SUTURE SELF: Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
__label__2	Mysterious hospital deaths: Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series.
__label__1	Time to quit series!: I have read each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful. But I will pass on the Bed & Breakfast series from now on.
__label__2	get what you pay for: Fine item, does what it needs to, the wires are small but works just fine. If you need a long cable like I did for a chase pipe run, then it works.
__label__2	Early learning toy: My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. The buttons on this toy are easy to push and knobs easy to turn. He was frustrated by his other pop up toy that he could rarely get to work with his tiny hands. This allows his cognitive abilities to develop even before his fine motor skills would be ready to use other toys.
__label__1	"Requires too much strength for toddlers: The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen ""reward"" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required."
__label__2	Great easy toy: My twins love this toy. They can use it on their own and it only makes small noises. The only down side is one seems to get his finger in the way when he pushes the tops down. I love the quality of tolo toys.
__label__1	not safe and no fun: once you get this toy in your hands you can see the cheap construction--the buttons don't work smoothly and the egg-tops are easy to pull off: just the right size for my toddler to pop in his mouth! i chucked this one right in the garbage....
__label__1	Of little interest: My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough.
__label__2	She is a good singer.: Stacie Orrico is a good singer. She has a God given talent. Even though her ways have changed she always has the ability to sing.
__label__1	eh What was I thinking?: Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats.
__label__2	"An excellent debut CD!: If you are considering purchasing Stacie Orrico's first CD ""Genuine,"" I would highly recommend it. This CD has a good mix of upbeat songs and sweet, slow tunes. ""Don't Look At Me"" was a big hit on Christian music charts, and for good reason! This is a great song with an awesome message. ""O O Baby"" is a really fun song with a good beat. My personal favorite on the album is ""Dear Friend,"" the final song on the CD, which Stacie wrote herself. It is a song about a friend who doesn't feel good about herself, but Stacie is trying to tell her that she is beautiful and that God loves her no matter what. This song has a beautiful melody and a powerful message. I highly recommend this CD. :-)"
__label__2	"Stacie rocks!!!!!!: This CD is a must buy.It has awesome mixture of pop and R&B.Stacie Orrico has a beautiful, powerful voice.This CD is for anyone who likes Britney or Christina but hates their lyrics.My favorite songs are, ""Don't Look at Me"",""Stay True"",and Genuine""."
__label__2	The Best: This is the best CD ever. The sound of Stacie Orrico's voice is great and the lyrics are great. You would nt excpect such a great sound from a 14 year old but she definitely pulls it off. The songs are suprisingly very pop-like.
__label__2	"So Cool!: This CD is great! It's lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as ""Dear Friend"" and ""Everything I Have"" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track ""Stay True"""
__label__2	"Awesome CD!!: Stacie Orrico is one talented teenager! I have to say, I was very surprised to find she was so young! I think it's wonderful and refreshing to have someone like Stacie Orrico in Christain Music. It sort of puts the ""life"" into the Christain Music for the average young person (or young at heart!:) who may find other Christain groups a bit dull or the music outdated. I bought this CD about a month ago and I can't stop listening to it. My daughter loves it too. I think the best songs are ""Without Love"", and ""Restore My Soul"". I didn't like every song at first, but they have a wonderful message and a catchy tune and I love them all now. If you like Christina Aguilara and Mariah Carrey, you'll LOVE Stacie Orrico."
__label__2	Satisfied: I paid 50 cents for this. Which was not bad at all. It was in good conditions for the price. One of the song did skip a little. But over all it was great for the price.
__label__2	WONDERFUL: I Love this CD. She is a great witness and all of her songs a great.Ride(9/10)very catchyDon't look at me(15/10)I love this song. It is definitely one of my favroites.O.O Baby(7/10)a little hard to understand but still good.Without Love(10/10)A song with a great tune and a great message.Stay True(20/10)my favroite Stacie Orrico song (you have to hear it to understand, but trust me its great)Genuine(10/10)A song that is genuinely great. A really great sound.With a little Faith(9/10)A good message and it's fun.So Pray(10/10)a great message. It is bold but she does a great job with it. I LOVE it.Holdin' On(9/10)really fun words and a great message!Restore my Soul(8/10)a lot like Holdin' On. Not as up-beatConfidant(10/10) I Love the tune and words.Everthing(6/10)Sweet but not very catchy.Dear Friend(13/10)A song that came from her heart and she wrote it her self which I really admire.
__label__2	this cd is tight: Stacie Orrico is Christian's Britney Spears. (Thats not a bad thing though!!). This album is worth the money because this girl can sing. My fave tracks on here are: Ride, O.O. Baby (my fave song!!), Without Love, Genuine, So Pray, Restore My Soul, Confidant, and Dear Friend. The rest of the tracks are so-so. But get her CD anyway, and go get her X-mas album too!!
__label__2	Totally Awesome!: Stacie Orrico is the best. Honestly, I downloaded all of her songs on Napster and I loved it. I loved the cd so much, I decided to buy the cd and support her so She will bring out new albums. Family Christian review says She is Destiney's Child with a Christian theme. I personally think along the lines of Aguilera with a Christian Theme. I am always glad to see young teen artist take a stand for Christ. Some of my favorite songs of hers are Don't Look at me, Stay True, and Dear Friend. I find myself putting their songs on repeat alot. If you want peak at her cd, goto http://www.launch.com/music/artistpage/1,4391,1048259,00.html(vocals included) or http://www.stacieorrico.com/ (just music, no vocals). And Rememeber, If your looking for perfection, don't look at (wo)men, Look at Him.
__label__2	Pretty Darn Good Stuff: I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone.
__label__2	"skeptical about pop music...: i'm usually really skeptical about pop music. if that pop sound is comin' outa the radio, ya gotta listen to the lyrics! Stacie sounds alot like Christina agulara, but i often question christina's meaning behind her lyrics, like in Genie in a bottle ""if ya wanna be with me"" and ""ya gotta rub me the right way"" really make me ask questions. when i listen to Stacie's album i know that what i'm listening to is clean and pleasing to God. this is defenitly the cd to buy, because everybody knows that you eventually memorize what you listen to no matter if you mean to or not. that also influences your thoughts. don't ask any more questions, just buy this cd right now!"
__label__2	Is this Christina??: This CD is amazing! Her voice talent is amazing! She will remind you of Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, I also feelA little bit of Mariah Carey in this CD! I would reccomend it to any one!
__label__1	Great Saw At First But Don't Use Too Often: I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. Everything on it worked great. A couple of months later the handle to tighten the miter adjustment stripped out. I ordered replacement parts from Makita and received them in a very timely fasion. Shortly after that it stripped again so I made my own replacement parts that work much better. Unfortunately other cheap plastic parts on it are starting to fail and fall apart. I am a big believer in Makita tools and own many for my contracting business, but I strongly suggest buying a different saw. The best part on the saw is the folding stand which I now use to hold my old De Walt rack and pinion table saw.
__label__1	"disappointing read: Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
__label__2	A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance.: Bob Holtel captures the essence of all essential ingredients that combine to produce an envied athletic endurance achievement. For anyone who has rested on their own laurels of completing a marathon or two, only they can truly appreciate Bob's accomplishment - Running four consecutive marathons every week, 12 weeks straight for three consecutive summers, on uneven rocky trails and at altitude!!! The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account. As an athlete I am honored to have shared the adventure. This book has produced a new hero who has proved again that with vision, preparation, planning and courage you can accomplish your dreams.
__label__2	A pleasure to read!: This book really is a must have for the PCT collector. This was a sweet read and I'd recommend it. I'd love to know this man, seems like a real gem of a guy. He had good running on the trail, made a great read.
__label__1	"New meaning to the term ""thin""!: Description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement. More like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers. Made in China of only 74% down. To state that this comforter has a retail price of $160 is laughable! Really more of a throw than a comforter. At $50 it is grossly overpriced! Look elsewhere!"
__label__2	Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal.
__label__2	"Lightweight and Warm: The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
__label__2	ok for the price: This comforter is ok for the price.its nto 100% down , so expect some mix.but overall , nice to have a extra ,maybe in the guestroom or so.Overall satisfied.
__label__2	"Stands the test of time: This was a very good read. I felt the same ""distancing"" from my husband that Betina did for the same reasons; kids, life, social expectations.The book stands up in todays world, just as it did back in 1967."
__label__2	I wont have that husband!!: This is a fabu book...all young women can learn from this book...this is the man NOT to marry...
__label__2	Good Read!: Diary of a Mad Housewife is a really enjoyable read. It's funny and true. It has a lot to say about life and I would recommend this book to any woman looking for a fun read!
__label__2	Great mastery of domestic details...: makes me feel that I understand Tina's life across time and space. For any woman who looks at her life and wonders what happened.
__label__1	very basic self talk: This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer.
__label__2	Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life: Michael J. Russ empowers you to let go of unsupportive self-talk and make supportive self-talk your second nature. He provides you with a highly effective and accessible manual for redesigning the way you think about yourself.

It will help you to drastically improve yourself and overcome any challenge you may encounter. This book is your best guide towards controlling a personal power that will help you take quantum leaps towards making radical changes in your life and accomplishing anything. It is the key to becoming your best and most positive self!
__label__1	This is not the screenplay: This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. If you are looking for the script for the 1987 film, keep looking.
__label__2	Really makes a difference: Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
__label__2	"His Second Album: Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (""Chicken Truck"" and ""I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal""). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase."
__label__2	real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. John Anderson is the real deal. This is what country sounds like without the glitter. Drawing from originals like Lefty Frizzell, Anderson's vocals are authentic; haunting on the sad songs. Great musicianship. I highly recommend it.
__label__1	a good historical book: if you like history books read this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afroamer. after the civil war
__label__2	Great Smoke Taste: Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
__label__2	Bradley Special Blend Bisquettes 48 pack: These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great.
__label__2	Good flavor to meat.: The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
__label__2	Woodlands Smoker: Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. The burn thoroughly and produce great smoke for the perfect taste. Everyones loves the result.
__label__2	Awesome Product!: We love our smoker and we love the smoker chips/bisquettes! The Bradley Cherry Bisquettes add a great flavor to Chicken, pork and beef! They are cheaper on Amazon than at Bass Pro or Cabelas.
__label__2	Bradley Pecan Bisquettes: They worked as advertised . I have used and enjoyed the flavor they impart to the meat . I also enjoy the apple flavor
__label__2	A great comfort: Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe.
__label__1	"Worst CD I bought in 5 years: I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""
__label__1	Gimme a break: This is ridiculously preachy stuff. I can tolerate a bit of leftiness in my folk, I find the sincerity touching, but this is too over the top to listen to all the way through more than once.
__label__1	Spare us the Preachy Folk Crap!: Ry Cooder is an incredible musician, but that does not automatically make you a great songwriter or a great album maker. He should stick to instrumental and soundtrack music, something he's good at.
__label__1	"quite boring...: I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
__label__1	Buddy: I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all.
__label__2	Warms the heart.: I am not American. Nor do I usually buy this kind of music. I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there. Its simple messages warm the heart. If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music.
__label__2	Ry's best work: This is an amazing disc. Much like his early work (Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, etc.), this song cycle recreates the dust bowl era in modern sonic terms and musical language. It combines folk, jazz, blues, and protest songs into a charming, intelligent and entertaining mixture. If you are a fan of classic American music and clever storytelling, then this is the CD for you. It's the aural equivalent of some of Steinbeck's novels (`The Grapes of Wrath' and `Travels With Charlie' come to mind), crossed with `The Wind in the Willows'. That may sound like an odd mixture, but the results are wonderful.As in the best American folk music of the era Cooder is recreating, these songs are political motivated, socially aware and purposefully accessible to a wide group of people. His take on this form would do Woody Guthrie proud. This is the best musical purchase I've made in quite a while.
__label__2	Ry Cooder: As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30's. He has continually explored the origins of music from Africa to Cuba to Mexico to early America with consumate ease. My Name Is Buddy is only available on import in Australia and not for general release so I am proud to have my copy included in my collection. I trust that he, and others, continue to explore our musical roots and Ry Cooder remains as one of the Four or five artists who have had a profound effect on my musical knowledgePaul Thomas Australia
__label__2	Ry Cooder My name is Buddy: I do like the atmosphere on this CD. It brings back memories of the folk mmusic from when I was young (sixties, early seventies. I also like lyrics and his views on society.
__label__2	"Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being ""red,"" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too."
__label__1	1 month to ship?: I ordered it on april 11, now it's apr. 29. I just found that it's going to be shipped on May 12th.It is just a trash can. Are you casting this after getting order? custom made? what's wrong with you? I don't cancel this order only because it was supposed to be included in free super saving shipping.
__label__2	Great product: This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin.
__label__2	Nice but not the best: I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products.
__label__2	Great for smoothing and repairing sensitive skin: Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. I use this a few nights each week to even out troubled-looking areas. It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.
__label__2	Fair: It is a very fair tribute to Celia. It's a shame that it was done so late when she wasn't abble to sing as she used to. The singers do well, but it leaves a sad taste to see Celia just sitting and listen to her songs being interpretated by others.
__label__2	Excellent: So interesting! This product is excellent. I recomend it.This CD is excellent!....Try it, try it...you will see Love Celia and all the artists!
__label__1	DVD CON PROBLEMAS: ESTE DVD LLEGO EN BUEN TIEMPO. SIN EMBARGO, SE FREEZA EN LA CANCION NUMERO 1 INTERPRETADA POR VICTOR MANUEL, UNA DE LAS MEJORES.
__label__1	Regret Purchase: It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. I expected more based on the reviews and I was very disappointed.
__label__2	The best of recent books on Wordsworth and Coleridge.: Eilenberg's book opens the complex and fascinating topic of intellectual property, in addition to providing brilliant readings of the major poems of these two seminal Romantic poets.
__label__1	Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book: This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'
__label__2	World Encyclopedia of Bread: Excellent book for beginners. A must for anyone who wants to fresh taste of home made bread. Excellent photographs and guidelines. Included also is method for adapting recipes for bread machines. As the name says it recipes from all over the world like England, Mediterranean and Asia are discussed, not to mention the American and festive type breads. I love it & sure that you will too
__label__1	Worst dubbing ever!: Fast beat motivating music. Average workout. But the dubbing is so bad as to be comically distracting. Might be better if you speak German, but with English dubbing, it's intolerable.
__label__2	camco wrench: This is a great tool. Due to arthritis, I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely. This enabled me to insert the plug(a replacementmetal one)with no leaks!
__label__1	Inaccurate description: My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better.
__label__2	an almost necessary tool.: I could easily have made this tool, but I'm getting lazy in my old age. It beats using a pair of channel locks, and much neater.
__label__1	Wasn't what I wanted: This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight.
__label__1	The ad didn't say what size this thing was: I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Since there was no choice of size, I assumed one size fits all. Well, unfortunately, one size does not fit all and this drain plug is too small for my drain plug.
__label__1	Did Not Work For Me: Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate.
__label__2	plastic tool: works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic
__label__2	Did not fit my Coleman E3: This appears to be perfectly fine as long as it fits. I guess the Coleman E3 does not use a standard fitting so it does not fit.
__label__2	great stuff: These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
__label__2	"Chore Boy Golden Fleece: I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Then, once they get old, after a month or two, they ""graduate"" to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks! Now that I am an adult, I can't stop using them. I even have my husband hooked! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops, so I ordered them...and got a great deal!"
__label__2	Golden Fleece is the BEST: Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!
__label__2	"Raised body temperature and metabolism: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."
__label__1	not a healthy product: I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk.
__label__1	"It made me gain weight.: This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just ""guggul"". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them."
__label__1	Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!: 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album.
__label__1	Should put his talent to better use....: Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only.
__label__1	What happened to Larry Carlton?: The elevator has arrived. Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!
__label__2	What's with all the complaining?: Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars.
__label__1	"Larry's Careful New Album: I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."
__label__1	"The obligatory contractual album: It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of ""talk a lot but say nothing"". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass."
__label__2	Chrysler/Blower: This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly. Haven't had any problems, but it has been in the vehicle only about a month.I would buy from this distributor again, especially since their price is half of what a car dealer wanted.
__label__1	Crap: This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!
__label__1	the movie rocks, BUT...: ... sometimes it's nice to see that, indeed sometimes we germans clearly get better editions of some movies than you americans do. and in this case, the german company E-M-S did a very cool 2-disc Special Edition of Perdita Durango (original title) with the original english soundtrack. so I'd recommend this edition to all you americans with region-free-players, 'cause THIS FILM ROCKS UNCUT!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Didint understand much: I'm not sure what the plot was for this movie, I really don't know what i got the movie either maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don't know but wasn't all that great.
__label__1	Dance with the Devil: This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
__label__1	A Waste of a Picture: This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?....
__label__1	A Piece of Trash: This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far. It also depicts Mexicans as cult members and grotesque.It places people in the Caribbean speaking with a Castillian accent. A real piece of trash and mentally disturbing.
__label__1	So bad.: This movie is so violence and so evil. It 's for those who love sex, drugs, etc. Children must beware of.
__label__1	"Great movie, but...: This is a great work by Alex de la Iglesia, but sadly this edition (""unrated"") has been butchered by A-pix. Many shots have been removed or replaced by video generated titles.Also, one of the high and emotional moments of the ending has been completely removed.If you can't get the original version, get this one. You will enjoy it because it is still a great movie. I give this edition only one star because I can't accept loosing that key moment at the end."
__label__1	"Be aware!: Don't blow 35 bucks on this because it says it's ""unrated"", here. They're ALL UNRATED, and you can find the same thing for just a few bucks elsewhere on this site!"
__label__2	"Miller's overlooked art: Steve Miller is probably the world's most underated guitarist. He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong ""Little Girl"" and the civil rights motif ""Don't you let nobody"" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. ""Baby's House"" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. ""Motherless Children"" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it. If not, you might want to start off his early stuff with Antholgy."
__label__2	THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE: Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
__label__1	I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem: I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
__label__1	Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally.
__label__2	WONDERFUL BOOK: If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!
__label__2	"VERY TEEN-MUSIC CD: I really Like This CD because I like this kind of ""Teen Music"". It seems Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera with a bad day and Enrique Iglesias... Its Just a GOOD CD.ME PIERDO JUNTO A TI: A VERY GOOD song, I love it. (9/10)VAS A VOLVERME LOCA: Good, but not the best from the CD. (7/10)LA LECCIÓN: One of the best songs. (10/10)LA NOCHE LLEGÓ: Very ""Enrique Iglesias Style"". (8/10)NO SOY UN ÁNGEL: Not very bad...but too Machine (6/10)NADIE COMO TÚ: VERY GOOD. Too Romantic (10/10)UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD: ¡¡GOOD!! (7/10)TU ME SALVASTE AYER: So...Funny!!! (9/10)DONDE ESTÉS EL CIELO ESTARÁ: It's not very bad...(6/10)ESCÚCHAME: VERY VERY GOOD! (10/10)ENGLISH TRACKS: Not very bad at all...but in English. (6/10)"
__label__2	"Brimful of Styles: We already knew that Cornershop represented a unique brew of styles. This single goes two steps further. ""Sleep"" is remixed in a 1983 New Wave style sure to evoke memories of Thomas Dolby and Falco. Norman Cook's incomparable mix of ""Asha"" is already world-famous, own it for 10 bucks less than the import."
__label__1	"Not Impressed: Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching.The menu doesn't work! I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
__label__1	Rip Off: First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know.
__label__2	An Acquaintance with darkness: A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it.
__label__2	"Pretty Good: I really liked this book! It is a Classic ""Rinaldi"". I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of ""dark"". It is not a real ""happy"" book to read although it is very good."
__label__2	Excellent content, Very easy reading, Historically correct!: I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much. It was nice to have the author describe in detail at the end where the actual fact ended and where the fiction began. You really understood why Emily was confused and felt for the country at the loss of the President. I would highly recommend this book for everyone from middle school age thru adult!
__label__1	An Aquaintance with Darkness: Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance.
__label__2	This book was Phnomenal: This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
__label__2	The Madness of Life: In this book Emily's world crumbles beneath her feet when her mother dies. She goes with her uncle instead of to her friend's (Annie) house like her mother and she had planned. After all of this she decides to stay in control of her life. By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book. I like it also because it was based on the truth and I like how the book ended, I guess you could say it was a different ending.
__label__2	One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not.
__label__1	Dark is right!: A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books.
__label__2	"Truly an ""Acquaintance With Darkness"": This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic. The book makes the characters realistic. It is haunting and morbid. I would suggest this book for anyone who would like a most creative and intersting view on the Civil War."
__label__2	First thought, bummer, as I read on more like Bravo!!!: The first paragraph or so , it was like Mrs. Rinaldi you can do better but as I read on I was like I take that back. I totally fell into the Washington D.C. backdrop. If I had to recommend this book to a person I'd also tell them this: you can't stop at just one of her books.
__label__2	A Very Suspenseful Book!: This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it.
__label__2	This book was very good I loved the suspense: there wasn't enough romance though.I wish her books were longer
__label__1	"A Disappointment: I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
__label__1	Poor!: I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing! Just a lame tone to follow along with.
__label__2	"Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' ""The Highwayman"" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like ""The Highwayman"" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Watch by Moonlight"". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."
__label__2	A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book. It helped my find the right cage, told me about dangerous toys, first aid, different species, etc. This book contains everything, if you only want to buy one book on lovebirds, make it this one. This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection. I am looking forward to the arrival of my first baby lovebird, and because of this book, I feel confident and at ease that I can provide a safe and loving home for my bird.
__label__2	Excellent book for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!
__label__2	Good book for pet owners, but not breeders: If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)
__label__2	Smooth and cool, like the anime series!: This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent.
__label__2	"Vitaminless?: The version of this CD that includes ""Vitaminless"" is a bootleg. It'll be from ""Sonmay"" or ""Everanime"" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks."
__label__1	Not woryh a plug nickle: Useless, just a junk kit. Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item. If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it, I would refuse it! Junk!
__label__1	Not what it claimed to be: The pic was so small - couldn't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all. I didn't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses. How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses.
__label__1	okay: the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses. the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in,even with someone else helping me. you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop. but i do like the keychain.
__label__1	Typical Imported Product: The case is pretty much useless. Nothing stays in the small compartments. I really dont know why they exist. The small screwdriver, both flathead & phillips are cheap material. You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws.
__label__2	Nice kit: Everything you need to fix your glasses. Nice kit. Don't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits, you'll still be left with broken shades. Indulge (haha) in the 6 dollar kit and you'll be right as rain.
__label__1	Screws do not have heads!: I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver. They looked loke little threaded rivets? No way to use them without a way to turn the screw. Quality rip off.
__label__2	Must Have foer Anyone with Glasses or Sunglasses: I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses (won't buy expensive ones ever again) and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out. Everytime I needed a repair it was $5-$10 but with this kit, I do it myself and that was worth the money!
__label__1	Doesn't smell like plumeria...unusable: This product smells disgusting, not like plumeria products I have bought. If you like plumeria, do not buy ... ... ... ...
__label__2	Nice lighter version of Tresor: This is a nice lighter version of Tresor for the summer. I've enjoyed it, although it does not smell just like Tresor.
__label__2	Good Enough I'm Looking for the Author: Help! My cousin in Brazil is trying to contact the author of this book. The letter he sent was returned to him as the address being no good. He had gotten the address out of the back of the book. Does anyone know how to contact the author?
__label__1	Fox Collection: The Great Fox War Movies (Patton - Special Edition / The Longest Day / Tora! Tora! Tora! - Special Edition)I purchased this set and the DVD's (6) Were Damaged. I requested a replacement. The Replacement was also damaged. The problem is the DVD's are in paper inserts in the Book. They are not protected. In the packaging process by FOX ( Not Amazon ) The DVD's get all scratched and will not play.
__label__2	Can't vouch for content, but packaging is really nice: As I said in the title, I can't vouch for the content as this was purchased as a gift for my Dad. However, the packaging is great. I thought Amazon made a mistake and sent a book instead of the DVD package, but it turned out to be BOTH a book and the DVD's (guess I should have read the description better). In any case, I know they are classic movies and this deluxe presentation will make an impressive gift.
__label__1	Not the best deal...: Do yourself a favor and buy the special two disk editions of each of these movies separately. You won't get the book, but you'll save almost $50 off the price of this set. Unless of course the book is worth the extra fifty to you... It certainly isn't to me.
__label__2	classic bit of entertainment: Adventure movie based on book, pretty much plot for plot. Set in Scotland, very late 60s, very cynical portrayals. And some stock pieces that have stuck in my memory clearly from when I first saw it in 1970. Holds its own, and the Wally Stott music hangs in the memory as well.
__label__1	Not the best choice...: Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted.
__label__1	AAARGH!: Avoid this game. I was gobsmacked to read the positive reviews on this game.There is little direction, you are left to wander about huge levels with chance bringing you across the necessary switch. The 4th level has caused me just to walk away from the game (Confluence). I cannot find a way out of the inital 3 levels. An online Game site I found said it was a bug so I downloaded an 80mb patch and had to replay from begining. Still no luck. Gamesite gave it 2.7 out of 10.The plot sounds great but is awful in reality - the script is like a 50's B movie and rather than guiding into suspicion about the Corporation ejects you into the Ressistance with the speed and elegance as a bad case of diorrea.I came across these reviews while trying to find BestBuys policy on returns of Software. ...
__label__1	Worst 3D shooter I ever played: I paid $2 for this at Gamestop. It is worth about $-30, (yes, that is NEGATIVE $30), because I wasted three hours of my life. Most of that three hours was spent working as a JANITOR, where nothing fun is happening.Most of the game play is spent walking around in circles in empty areas looking for the correct way out. Very boring. Enemies are not fun to fight. My favorite was the huge level with invisible enemies. How fun is it to spend hours going over the same layout again and again while looking for INVISIBLE creatures.This could be the worst game I ever played.Yes, I was stuck forever at the eco-dome, because there the door out wouldn't open. I think that might have been the bug referred to earlier.Do not buy this game.
__label__2	To the point: Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it's a thick book - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e.g. classic Nordic skis or 3-pin tele's. Alpine riders seeking vertical ft look for George Hurchalla's book.
__label__1	A disappointment: This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money.
__label__2	WIll work with new drivers: My brother and I have had to split our time on the internet for a while. (He has a desktop which uses an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, while I have a laptop which requires the ethernet cable to be plugged into an airport) So for Christmas, I decided to give him a gift that would please me as well, this wireless adapter. The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work. Finally, my brother found some way to install new drivers for the PCI card. After he did this, it worked fine. I hope this review helps anyone that might be having similar troubles.
__label__2	Not ready for Windows seven: Had great connection and was REALLY fast. It was not ready for windows 7 tho, it doesn't has the drive for it yet!
__label__2	Works Great: I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great.
__label__2	A little trouble connecting but works fine: I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. It took me over an hour to finally connect, but I don't think this is the fault of the product, just my computer. I have been connected for about 5 minutes now and it works great =). The signal's good (I'm 40 or 50 ft from the wireless router and signal strength jumps between 91% and 95%) and It's about just as fast as my other computer with a physical internet connection. I would recommend it if you're looking for something cheap that works.
__label__2	Really good value for the money: I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don't currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem.I picked this card based on the rating and reviews here. I am happy to say that they were very accurate and this is a really good card, especially given that the price is so low compared to other, brand name cards.Installation was very simple and the signal strength and speed are perfect. I was in a hurry so I just used the Windows wireless client instead of the dedicated, included software but perhaps if I get time later, I will try running that.All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this card - right price and very good performance.
__label__2	Satisfied Customer: I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house. I'm surprised that I get 75-80 percent signal strength from where I am, which was way less that my last one that had the small antenna attached directly to the pci card. All I can say is the price and the product are both awesome.
__label__2	Vista Home Premium 64-bit SP1 easy install: After reading past reviews, I was prepared to have to download special 64-bit drivers to make this card work with Vista 64-bit. But they weren't needed: Vista 64 automatically got the drivers from Windows Update, and I was connected to my WPA network in minutes. Never needed the MSI installation disk or the drivers I'd downloaded.Card itself works find, excellent signal strength. The little antenna is fine, although I may wind up velco-ing it to the case.
__label__2	Stable and fast!: I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts. Works great on my 64-bit system. There are no cons to this card. Buy it while it is still available. Other sites are out of stock!!!!
__label__2	leet product: This thing can pick up signals better than anything I have used. It gets a better signal than the Linksys or Buffalo router functioning as a wireless bridge (via DD-WRT or Tomato). Installation is just like any other windows device. Extremely stable connection even with crappy routers.
__label__2	Easiest route I have ever installed!: I noted the opinions of previous raters of this product and decided to give it a try.Not only was delivery fantastically quick, but the wireless card installed instantly and required no configuration by me! So nice to buy something that installs easily and works well.
__label__2	Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...: Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating.
__label__2	Works Good.: I Bought this card for a third computer in my house and its the ferthest from the router and works fine.
__label__2	"Fastest so far!: Bought this to install in a 40 Gig, HP Pentium 4 hard drive government surplus computer that is about 2-3 years old. Other than having trouble connecting it with my QWest wireless service (it wouldn't show in the little box they kept telling me to click on even though the wireless card properties said ""the device is working properly""), I got it to connect anyway and this computer now has the fastest internet in the house! It is faster than my brand new Dell that I got last year. I am recommending it to my parents who bought similar surplus computers after seeing how fast the internet was on this computer. I don't think it is the computer though, I think it is the wireless card! It was easy to install, too (and I have never installed anything in a tower before). I am very pleased with it, esp. for the price!"
__label__1	Weak Signal: I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!
__label__2	GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!: This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome.
__label__1	did not work: The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
__label__2	Very Fast Wireless Card: I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. With the computer in the same room as my wireless card I don't even need to use the antenna. I am very impressed and it has worked flawlessly for me.
__label__2	Works with Vista 64: I loaded this up today and out of the box it did not work with vista 64, I had to go on another computer and go to MSI's website to get the vista 64 drivers. Once I had those I ran them and the card works great. Only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 is because while using this to game I lag for about 1 second every couple of minutes, it's just enough to be a pain.
__label__2	"Works with XP 64!!!!: I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. I tried two different USB devices and three different PCI devices and none of them worked until this product. What a great price too. I put it in loaded the software and BAM! it work perfectly. Very cool how some thing just work and for about one third the price of all those other devices that I tried. My only complaint would be the 18"" external antenna. I wish it was one of the folding ones that comes attached. Oh well.... I'm just happy to be finished and not have to return any more stuff because it doesn't work."
__label__2	Works great: This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
__label__2	Works Great!: This little card installs flawlessly on Windows 7 and then just works like a champ. Great connectivity while connecting to a Linksys WRT54G from a fairly difficult location (downstairs and across the house!). Very happy with it, especially at this price,
__label__2	Easy to install...cheaper than buying directly from Dell!: This card is a breeze to install, fits right into the slot in my Dell PC. Dell was asking for $50 for pretty much the same card, preinstalled. Saved a bundle. Couldn't be happier. No issues with Windows, no problems with connection speed. Certainly recommend this product.
__label__2	Good product. Recommended.: This works as well as the other reviewers suggested. Easy installation if you've opened up your cpu before and exchanged a pci card before. The antenna has good range, and I was connected in minutes to my wireless router. Thanks a lot.
__label__2	Reliable, Fast, and Inexpensive.: I've burned through 4 different types of USB Internet dongles and a few PCMCIA cards of all brands. Only one dongle works now and it's from Trendnet. So I decided to go with PCI cards for wireless internet. The first one I got was for my wife. It was a good deal until they doubled the price when I needed a few more. Trolling Amazon I went. After reading all of the reviews, I settled on this card. I purchased two and they work flawlessly. One is connected 24/7 to the Internet, my daughter can't miss a beat with Club Penguin, and the other runs an FTP server 24/7. I have had them for a while now, at least 6 months or so, and they work a lot better than most of the USB dongles I've had. I have no issues uploading or downloading huge files from FTP to my HTTP server.It was a good buy.
__label__2	Great Wireless PCI card: It is a wonderful and for the price, nothing can beat it.I had other USB adapters installed before and never have great reception as this does.Highly recommend.The MSI software needs a little attention but if you follow the procedures, you should be fine. Took no more than 15 minutes to get every thing ironed out.
__label__1	"Incompatible with windows7: OK, I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. The official website doesn't have a driver for windows 7. It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur. Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router, but 80% of the time, the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is ""server not found"". It's on its way back to amazon. If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it's out, avoid this card as best as you can."
__label__1	antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION
__label__1	Not Worth It: This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
__label__1	Doesn't work: This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
__label__1	DO NOT BUY!: 1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
__label__1	Keeps dropping the connection.: I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon.
__label__2	Works great on Vista 64-bit: NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network.Didn't even need the enclosed drivers. Vista 64-bit connected the device without a hitch and it's been working flawlessly for about 1 year.EDIT 09/24/2011This device also works great with Linux Ubuntu 10.04...
__label__1	crc receive errors: Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution.
__label__2	Significant improvement over my USB wireless: I had a USB wireless adapter that got 50-60% signal strength. This this adapter, I get around 90%. I've absolutely no problems with this card and have been impressed by it's performance.
__label__2	"works well: does as advertised. Bought this because of current reviews and it's great. I have to ""repair"" the connection about once every 2 weeks on the machine being used with this card, but I never have to repair the connection on my other computer. Not sure why this is, but it's a really fast fix and never causes problems."
__label__2	Works as advertised: Good product, works just as described. Easy to install. Have not had any problems thus far.
__label__2	Simple Installation: I received and installed this last night on my kids 4 year old HP desktop. It is a replacement for the Buffalo wireless USB adapter the kids broke a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to get a replacement Buffalo product but found that a court injunction now bars Buffalo from selling many of their products in the US.I installed the Super G and it interfaced with the Buffalo router in 30 seconds. No problem at all. It even receives pretty good signals from 5 other wireless networks in my neighborhood. I am no computer geek but will say this product works like a charm with no dropped signals so far.
__label__2	Excellent signal: A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice.
__label__2	Talk about plug and play!: I have windows Vista to start with. Installation took all of 5 minutes. I installed the software that came with the product and could not get my PC to recognize the card installed in an empty PCI slot. Went to the manufactures website and sure enough, they had the new software upgrade for VISTA. Installed it and was online instantly. It seems as fast as direct cable hook up. Worth every penny. A great product...
__label__2	Works great with Windows 7: Just got this card for my new Windows 7 machine. Worked great after I got the RA link drivers from their website. Seems fast, doesn't lose connections, the antenna seems sturdy. Right now only using it with 802.11b but it seems fast enough!
__label__2	Works great!: I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn't dropped signal on me yet
__label__1	Does not work with Windows Vista & Airport: Tried and failed to get my pc set up on our Airport 802.11g network. Vista did not recognize the card; XP recognized the card but would only let me join the network when we turned security off. I'm sure that this is a Windows problem more than it is the fault of the wireless card, but still--couldn't get this product to work and now we have to buy another card.
__label__2	Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2: I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!
__label__2	Works Great!: I had a Linksys wireless receiver that was not compatible with Vista, so after upgrading my computer, I found this on Amazon and based on reviews, decided to give it a shot. Worked wonderful right out of the box, and signal strength is excellent! Works like a champ, and easy to install. Highly recommend if you need a Vista compatible connection to your wireless router.
__label__2	Works great: I added this to my windows vista desktop. It seems to work fine. I have been using it for months.
__label__1	lost settings: Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days.
__label__1	Total garbage! Software terrible. No support. Don't buy!: I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G.
__label__1	Works, but with limitations.: This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card.
__label__2	Works great: This product works really good. My computer is pretty far from any connection, yet it still connects great, and is usually very fast.
__label__2	It works!: I bought this because my crappy D-link wireless pci adapter was dying only after about 6 months into use. It was dropping connections every 10 minutes or so. Now after I plug this in, I get at least 4 bars compared to average 2-3 bars i used to get with d-link. I saw some users complain about the short antenna. Yes it is pretty short but long enough to get on top of the computer and that alone can make whole lot of difference. Otherwise spend little more money and get more expensive ones. For this price, this one is a steal. Also to anyone who bought/will buy this item. Do yourself a favor, dont use the crappy driver that comes with it. Go to ralink website and download their reference driver.
__label__1	Very Dissapointed: This is a book that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Great Pictures of Bassets. And then it is a general dog Information Book.I was looking for a Book that would be much more specific about Basset Hounds and not a product catalog.
__label__1	Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets.

__label__1	Waste of money: This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use.
__label__2	DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!: this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
__label__2	Great product: This is a great product for the price. For a home theater aplication this amp does more than expected. And for the price you just can ask anymore. I got this amp shipped very quickly and received it without any problems all the way in Aruba! The amp has a bunch of preset EQ's so you'll find one that'll fit you. I run these through old but faithfull Pinnacle 200 monitors and some RCA surrounds and the whole set just begs to be played out loud. It's been a while since I felt rumble in the room from such a deep bass. I think it's part amp part speakers. If you match them correctly you won't go wrong.
__label__2	Outdated but Great for Essays, Papers, and Editing: I value this book since I proofread papers, essays, administrative memos, etc. for clients on liveperson.com and in past careers. This helps for office filing, clerical/administrative basics if you are working on these type of jobs/duties required. I also recommend this book for editing projects and for reference for college papers.
__label__2	a valuable resource: if you need to have clarity regarding the usage of the written word, this book will be a valuable, easy to use reference.
__label__2	Simply the best: I teach business writing in industry and government, and I recommend the Gregg Manual enthusiastically in all my programs, at every level. There are a lot of wonderful resources out there, including Albert Joseph's classic EXECUTIVE GUIDE TO GRAMMAR, that can help you understand what makes our language tick, but there is nothing like Gregg when you need an authoritative answer NOW to a specific (even picayune) question. And it's striking to see how EXCITED seemingly well-balanced people from all walks of life can be when they first get their hands on Gregg. After reading the other reviews here, I am even preparing to do the unthinkable and buy a new copy - just to see what the new edition has to say about computers (my copy is a little old...).
__label__2	Book review: great book a lot better than I excepted. It is now being used in class. quick shipping. very happy. looking for more from that author and related material.
__label__2	An invaluable style and reference manual for advertising copywriters: This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. There may be a new edition that supercedes this one by the time you read this. if so, I would buy it without reservation. I find myself reaching for this time and again when I write. Highly recommended.
__label__2	Simply the Best!: Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch.
__label__1	Boo! Stay away from this product: Such a great idea, perfect in its simplicity, and yet executed so horribly. This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review on Amazon (I was so worked up I even took pictures and added them to the product description).1. The tactile feel of the product sucks. The buttons should click or at least depress nicely.2. Murky, hard to read numbers. Even when I push down all the way some numbers are still barely legible and I wonder if my daughter will be able to depress the buttons all the way.3. Some of the math is wrong! 1 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 3? This isn't exactly advanced vector calculus and it's THE ONLY THING this product is supposed to do. At least do it right. Even if the company realized the mistake after one million units were produced, they should have the pride to not ship a math product geared exclusively towards kids learning math with bad math on it.1 star, avoid.
__label__1	Hard to see answers under buttons: I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.
__label__2	Perfect for a first grader: great for a child just learning basic math concepts. has really helped my first grader gain an edge with math facts
__label__2	No batteries calculator!: My husband had these as a kid. If you push the buttons down, the answer becomes visable through the plastic. Durable and great for our kids to practice math with.
__label__2	Use product in bright light: I bought this toy for my daughter, I remember playing with this at a cousins house as a child. Although, I don't remember having a hard time seeing the numbers as a child. I found that it is best to used to product over a light.. if possible, or in a well lit area. I THINK THE PRODUCT COULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WERE A MINI LIGHT BUILT IN THE BACK OF THE GAME.Durable and fun though.
__label__2	Great learning toy!: Bought this for my niece, as I had one similar as a child and she loves it as much as I did! It's a fun way to learn addition and subtraction!
__label__1	Plus-Minus Chart Toy: Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above.
__label__1	"Useless: I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
__label__1	out of stock?: When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else. very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again.
__label__1	Arrogant Author: I found that the style of the book was more about the author showing off his knowlege, rather than presenting the information. There are few examples, and the ones that are there, are poorly explained. There is a severe lack of organization - he just seems to spew information. At times he shows us his humor - not very funny, but the most readable part of the book.He spends too much time bashing C and C++. (Does he think it makes him look smart?) I want to learn Java, not compare it to other languages and think how great I am for using it (like he does). One has to know C++ to understand what he's saying. In general, if you know already OOP and C++ this book will be good for you, otherwise STAY AWAY!!!
__label__1	AWESOME Writer - Not updated for all of Java2...: Rushed to press, not all of the Java2 API is included in this volume. I loved Java 1.1 and Beyond, but I wasted my money on this one...
__label__1	ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER: I got this book for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. I hate this book! Maybe some people who have a little background would like it better.
__label__1	It is pretty bad: I am a computer Science student at the university of new brunswick and i felt that this book was a complete waste of time. The author would introduce new topics and then jump into rather difficult examples with very little explanations. I would recommend that anybody interested in learning java to not buy this book.
__label__1	"A good source of propaganda!: I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
__label__2	"Great book - easy learning: I loved ""Just Java 2"", and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Unlike what one other reviewer wrote, there is no assumption of C++ (It amazes me that people who read a book so superficially feel free to share their wrong assumptions about it). Just Java 2 is well written and easy to follow. The examples are interesting, and the source, the Java FAQ, and a wealth of other info and compilers is on the accompanying CD. Highly recommended!"
__label__1	"Vague: This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
__label__1	Lacks depth.: This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes.
__label__1	"I am surprised this book is endorsed by SUN: This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter ""FILE I/O"", after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."
__label__1	"Not Practical: This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
__label__1	Its little hard..: The way he used to explain the topics are confusing..I was very excited to buy this book but found it difficult instead of having C and C++ knowledge.
__label__2	Great book...the best one I looked at.: Explanations are clear and concise....which is what I needed. Includes sample code to illustrate points made.
__label__1	NOT so good: Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly.
__label__2	The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book.
__label__2	Just Java 2: Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow.
__label__2	"Not as good as his book ""Deep C Secrets"": I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled ""Deep C Secrets"" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level."
__label__2	Great book for existing programmers: This book is great for people (like me) who can already program, and just want to learn Java. I found it went at the right pace to get me the info I needed on Java. Most examples are small enough to understand easily, with much bigger ones inc. complete games & applications on the CD. Highly recommended if you want to learn Java, and already know C or Fortran or VB etc
__label__2	Excellent intro to Java and OOP for newbies.: I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail.
__label__1	"Do not buy this book unless you know C++: I thought I'd be able to learn Java from this book, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the author attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java.I found the book condescending to non C and C++ programmers, and the order of subjects he chooses to teach Java is wierd.If you want to learn Java and don't know C or C++, do not look here, go to Dietel and Deitel's ""Java: How to Program"" instead."
__label__1	"Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this book should have been, ""Java for C/C++ Programmers"". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, ""In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte."" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is ""Core Java, Vol 1"", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."
__label__1	Not a very thorough book: This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language.
__label__1	Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book.
__label__1	very cryptic details: not suited for beginner's should have qiute lucid explationsi dont recommend for new commers to java
__label__1	"very bad book: The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book ""core java 2"" is much better."
__label__1	Not for true beginners: I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!
__label__1	"Please dont buy if you are entirely new to Java Concepts: Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - ""If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO..."" is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."
__label__2	A Reader from Fremont, CA (near San Francisco).: Just Java 1.2 thought me a lot about programmings. First I used Core Java but now, I like Just Java 1.2 better. JUST JAVA RULES!
__label__1	Don't waste your hard-earned money: This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do.
__label__2	Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book.
__label__1	Easy to read, but NOT a good reference: Just Java 2 is very readable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. I'd read a chapter and feel like I had a fairly complete understanding. But when I tried to apply what I learned, I always struggled. The problem for me was his examples are way too fragmented and incomplete. I spend lots of time reviewing FAQ sites for descent examples.I would not recommend this book.FYI - I am new to OOP, but relatively experienced with C, ADA, Fortran, ...
__label__1	"Great for C Gurus...: The back cover mentions it is a book for people with ""programming backgrounds"". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is ""C/C++ expertise"". If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like ""you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference."" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."
__label__2	Great Activity Book - Cover Questionable: This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking.
__label__1	Cheaply made: Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
__label__2	"I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
__label__2	Costly but good: This trainning pad is the most absorbant I've ever seen. It also attracts your pooch and can be soiled via urine a couple of times before being discarded. You never seem to smell urine and never have to worry about leakage however it is very costly. I have found pads that are much cheaper with slightly less of a quality. After paying high prices for this brand for over a year my eyes are begining to rove to the lesser costly brand.
__label__2	"Excellent movie, poor quality DVD, poor quality video: My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship. You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an ""OK"" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the ""extra"" information isn't. The ""shame on you"" goes to The Richard Diercks Company, Inc., and Simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of ""what not to do"" in DVD production, development, and video transfer."
__label__2	More than just music: This is one of the best Christian music CDs you can ever find in the music industry. Christian music is different from secular music, and the difference is that Christian musicians are there to praise God, instead of praising themselves for their talent, and to guide listeners' heart and mind to God through music. And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life. It is more than just beautiful. Too bad, there is only 5 stars to rate her. I would give her 10 stars!
__label__2	Great CD, Great Artist!: This CD is one that you will never get tired of. Jennifer's talent and sound are incredible. She is one of the most gifted artist's I've ever listened to. I would recommend this CD to anyone and have already bought it as a gift for most of my acquaintances.
__label__2	Jennifer LaMountain: Listening to Jennifer's message and voice is very promising to me! It lift's up my thought's and makes me look foward to our real home with Jesus in Heaven! Beautiful words and music!
__label__2	"Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,"" which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the ""happy ending"" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."
__label__1	Did not learn much: Instant Immersion French is poor when it comes to teaching you French. I was just unable to learn from this program unlike some other programs which have helped me. Beware this product, I would consider a different company's product over this one. I have also tried French Now by Transparent Language and found that it taught me French quite well.
__label__1	Really should be zero stars: This product is really a disappointment. There are no menus and no lessons one, two, etc. On CD 1 you learn some basic words and then on CD 2 there is nothing but French. The other CDs are not much more help. I bought this program to learn French and now I'm considering not wasting my time, trashing it and starting again.
__label__1	Worthless: It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
__label__1	Next time read the item description Edgardo: This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this.
__label__1	If you like Tozer, you won't like this!: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!
__label__2	"This CD is Great!: I have this CD! I like ""Adventure Heart~Davis's theme~""and number17 music,number1 song. Number1 song'sJapanese title is""Target~Akaishougeki~"" Number17'sJapanese title is ""Kenchan..wormmonnotheme."" This music is my favorititeits.

__label__1	baaaaaadddddddd bookkkkkkk: por favor no gaste su dinero en este pesimo y mediocre libro,,lo unico que la mujer y el chino hacen es mostrar su impresionante flexibilidad,pero nada mas,,no aportan tecnicas reales ni explicaciones para llegar a ese estado.me parece mas bien que los autores lo que quieren es que la gente sepa que ellos tienen una super-flexibilidad impresionante.este es solamente un librito y nada mas,, muy,,muy pero muy mediocre
__label__2	My cat loves them !!!: What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
__label__2	"A Good New Irish (Rock) Group: If you're interested in Celtic or Irish music these guys out Kansas will get your foot dancing, and beyond! The other good CD from them is American Wake. Great music to get you ""wild and crazy"" some night because they don't slow down with many of their songs. Not old Celtic music, but there are enough of a taste to please any purist. Give it a try!"
__label__2	Bloody Brilliant !: Was introduced to the lads by my daughter, Lindy. They performed in Cheyenne, Wyo last summer (looks like they'll be back this year too (can you see me smiling? ) I saw them last September in Estes Park, and they are brilliant ! Their upbeat numbers will get your feet tapping, your hands clapping and your heart pounding. My favourite, however, is a much slower one: Men of Erin,, it'll give you goose bumps and bring a tear to your eye,,,, We love ya, lads,,,, Slainte !
__label__1	not sufficient after a long day at the computer: I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
__label__2	The Hound of Baskerville: The book is what I would call an intriguing tease. Doyle creates a mood throughout the whole book that keeps the reader sitting on the edge of their seat. I would definitely recommend this book for those readers who like a good mystery.
__label__1	Missing content is not acceptable - Wake up, Amazon!: Missing content is not acceptable for publishing books, either paper version or digital version! Please fix the problem, Amazon!!!!
__label__1	Missing Content: this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
__label__1	Excellent Book; Terrible Kindle Version: The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers. There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories. In a complete version, it's a four-star book.
__label__2	A nice abridgement: These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks. It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive. My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete. Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it.
__label__2	"The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!: I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
__label__2	Like Finding an Old Friend: I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old.
__label__2	Lasts a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is one of the best. It has lasted over a century, having been published in 1901. If you haven't read it, do so today--there haven't been many changes in detective fiction in the last hundred years.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.
__label__2	Male only spaces: I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times.
__label__2	"The Hound of the Baskervilles: The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection. We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book. The book itself is, of course, a ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people. The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text."
__label__2	Top Rate Holmes..........: Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!
__label__1	The Hound of the Baskervilles: This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library.
__label__1	Missing substantial passages on Kindle version: I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete.
__label__1	The Hound of the Baskervilles MP's story!!!: I liked the book because I like murder mysteries and if you like that kinda stuff this is a book for you! But it gets boring because you have like 14 pages a chapter basically about noghting. Also I like this book because it's got non-other than Shelock Holmes the greatest detective in book history.In the beginning it does get intresting. But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects. But he also follows them and decides if he thinks they murdered the person or not? Setting is next the setting is in London. They make it sound really scary where they are at Baskerville Hall where the heir of Sir Charles Basketville who died left to his nephew.
__label__1	"Paranormal forces in my mystery?: I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."
__label__1	The Hound: The name of my book is Hound of The Baskervilles. In this book the main character is sir Charles Baskervilles. He is a very important man then one night he dies. But he was found dead out side during his evening walk. So it is up to Sherlock Holmes to find out if this was caused to natural causes or it was rough play. Sherlock has little time to solve the mystery before chaless nephew receives his place as a rich tycoon.Idid not like this book and do not suggest this to anyone.
__label__1	Hard to read: This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle. I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.
__label__1	BAD BOOK!: this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!
__label__1	"Nothing superb about Holmes.: ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
__label__2	Howllllllll: My grandaughter needed this book for school. Instead of trying to find one in the book stores, I had her download it on her Kindle. Fast, easy and it made me look good to my grandaughter. The purchase was a bargain at $0.99. She reviewed the book, got an A on the assignment and all is well in Houston.....Buy a Kindle...download book assignments and be a hero to your family.m
__label__2	great!: very good book. read it for school, but it was definitely worth it to read it. good story line that kept me interested through all the plot twists
__label__2	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve: I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now.
__label__1	Where's the rest?: I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing! All the poems in Alice in Wonderland as well as Through the Looking Glass and now the manuscript in Baskervilles.Either the free editions are poorly edited before release (if indeed they are proofread at all) or (more likely) Amazon is releasing an incomplete product for free in order to force us to buy one of their fancy versions. I might understand if this were an author who is still around, but with the classics I think this is unacceptable.
__label__1	great story - but don't buy this version!!: This is one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes tales, and I was thrilled that it could be acquired so cheaply for my Kindle. However, whenever a character reads out loud from a newspaper or other document, the passage being read is missing from this Kindle edition. As such, information vital to the tale is missing. Terrible! Spend more money, and get a comprehensive (and comprehensible!) version.
__label__1	Read This First!!!!!!!!!: okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!
__label__1	Buy from a different publisher!: There are key parts of this book missing. I was so confused about the story until I realized this. Get the book from a different publisher.
__label__1	Missing Text!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I agree with the previous reviewer. I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2. Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well. Pay the two dollars and get the complete book. Who knows how much else is missing.
__label__2	"The Hounds of the Baskervilles criticism: The story was a little uneasy at first, but the action and plot and all that good stuff kicks in. Seems to me, just one of those ""you have to get into the plot sort of books"" I'd recommend it to all, who would like to get into the Sherlock Holmes universe for the first time..."
__label__1	Let down in literature: All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery.
__label__2	"Enhanced with music and sound effects: The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
__label__2	"chris's review: this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery."
__label__1	Good book, bad copy.: My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story.
__label__1	"Its OK: I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
__label__2	This is the definition of mystery genre. Doyle at his best.: This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed
__label__1	Useless: This edition is missing all passages in which a character is reading a letter or article, which is essential to the story. This edition is useless and needs to be removed from Amazon or corrected.
__label__1	missing content: I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download. Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
__label__1	Missing passages: For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound. I don't know if it's just a technical glitch because I'm using the Kindle software on my Mac or there is something else going on. Doesn't seem to be much point in having a book with parts of the story missing.
__label__1	Mising Information/Incomplete: This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost.
__label__1	Missing Passages: Note: this is a review is specific for theThe Hound of the Baskervillesedition and not the book as a whole. The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book. If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone. Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version.
__label__1	Passages missing: This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues.
__label__1	Great story... but not on the kindle: I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy. Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars. There have to be better versions out there, though.
__label__1	Missing text.: Just wanted to agree with the other reviewers that this version is useless. I ended up getting a free version of this book from Project Gutenberg.
__label__2	Holmes Fan Created: This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!
__label__2	"Not so mysterious, but a great setting: Although it didn't have enough suspects to be as ""mysterious"" as some of the other Sherlock Holmes stories I've read (the ""big reveal"" of the villain was not surprising at all), this one was still a fun read.My favorite part about the book was the atmosphere. I wonder if the moor where most of the book is set is a real place. If so, I want to visit. Rocky tors, misty swamps, ancient dwellings made from stone, and the occasional large stately mansion. I'm ready to buy my plane ticket to London."
__label__1	"Missing Critical Text!: This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
__label__1	Missing parts: I concur with previous reviews. Unacceptable copy as it is mising passages - as mentioned before - which creates the most confusion from the very start. Should be removed from the Amazon catalog as it is unbecoming of this vendor. SAVE YOUR TIME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
__label__2	"The Best ""Hound"" Ever: This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
__label__1	Don't bother downloading this copy: As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text.
__label__1	Hound of the Baskervilles: This edition is missing THE main plot of the story. Every time there is a letter or a newspaper article that is read (which anyone who reads Sherlock Holmes knows is a common device), it is skipped in the text entirely. This isn't even a good deal for free!
__label__1	Kindle version is missing text that is central to the story: This Kindle version is missing huge portions of text.For example, the entire manuscript read in Chapter 2 is missing.Amazon: please fix it or remove this defective version.
__label__1	Missing passages ruin great story: This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!
__label__1	"Defective Kindle edition--critical info missing!: If Amazon would have let me, I would have rated it *no* stars. This Kindle version of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" has a huge flaw: every time a character reads aloud from a text, that text is omitted from this edition. Here is an actual quote from my Kindle:""Dr. Mortimer [. . .] read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative ...""Considering that the omitted passages include the actual legend of the Hound, as well as the account of the death that brought the client to Holmes, this renders the story unreadable. Sadly, it looks like you get what you pay for in this instance..."
__label__1	Defective version of great story: As others have pointed out, this version is missing critical portions that totally ruin one of the greatest mysteries in the English language. Free is generally good, but not in this case.
__label__2	"One of the All-Time Classics!: Sherlock Holmes is at his best every time you read it, and this newly-published edition is no different. The 2009 edition is well-edited, and well-presented, and the story is timeless. If you have read ""Sherlock Holmes"" in the past, it should take no convincing as to why you should read it again. If you have never read this book, then you need to purchase this today and enjoy the amazing story that the rest of us have been enjoying for years. This novel also makes a fantastic gift for those of our younger generations that have never had the pleasure of enjoying Sherlock Holmes in all of his glory.Please enjoy this book, and share it with your friends and family!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" series, and the newly-published ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
__label__1	Not network friendly: We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit.
__label__2	printer: it is a very good printer I give it only 4 star becauce if I want to print more than on page on a row it has long delay between pages, it prints fast
__label__2	Print This: I was a bit concerned about my first network device but this one was just plug and go. Worked first try and we now have a silent ( it's not in my office)fast, reliable printer.
__label__1	Will not work with PrintServers: I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer. Problem is the HP Laserjet 1020 doesn't work with either the Netgear or Linksys Printservers which boggles the mind. My customer wan't happy and neither am I.
__label__2	The Vedic Path: This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. My friend, whose birthday present it was, was enchanted, and used it for meditation, excercise, and to create a peaceful ambience for writing. The vocals are evocative and ethereal without being repetitive or simplistic. I would recommend.
__label__2	Love this record book: It is simple enough that I don't feel like I'm scrapbooking (because who has time with a toddler and a newborn) but has a lot of fill in the blanks and page suggestions that keep me on track. I say suggestions because you could easily cover the prompts with more pictures and write other information on some of the pages. I have one for my daughter and my son. The color is NOT pinkish as it seems in the picture, it is a light orange gingham.
__label__2	A treasure: Thsi book is the greatest. I really covers everything baby would want to know when she gets older. My warning is that you better start writing the minute you get it or you can miss important days as you get so busy when baby is born. Try to get this item before baby is born so that you can acquaint yourself with the information you will need to enter. GET IT!!! My only regret is that one day after I bought it my sister bought me one so I could have saved that cash. My sister returned it.
__label__2	Fantastic: I recently purchased this memory book for one of my sisters who is expecting her first baby soon and she was so grateful. She loved it and now I am considering buying more for other relatives who are expecting..
__label__2	"Beware!: Readers should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as ""Emilio's Carnival."" Don't be fooled by the classy NYRB edition; the usually impeccable editors of that series have passed this ""vintage"" translation into print with nary a warning. Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems. For more information on de Zoete as a translator, see William Weaver's excellent introduction to his wonderful translation of ""Zeno's Conscience,"" which nicely dispatches de Zoete's ""The Confessions of Zeno"" to the dustheap of translation history."
__label__2	Passion: Very good about passion in a Proustian way. Is marked by country: Italy, and age. Complicated task by a writer tofollow different persons thoughts over time. This is Svevo's art.
__label__2	Great CD: This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd's that are not english. All of the songs on it are great. I am not new to this form of music anymore so if you are new to this form of music and are a Sailor Moon fan like me. This would be a very good buy. ;}
__label__2	"just beautiful.: This is one of my favorite albums. The score for this film was extrodinary and the original music performed by Deborah Lurie was absolutely gorgeous.The top 5 songs of the soundtrack:1. ""It's Alright"" by Peace Out featuring Chris Logan (Black Sabbath cover)2. ""Tim's Song"" - Deborah Lurie3. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" - Postal Service4. ""Baby Hold On"" - Nina Khoury5. ""Waterfall"" - I-94This is the very best cover of ""It's Alright"" I've ever heard. Guns N Roses tried it once but this one is slightly better. It's a beautiful song and was a fantastic choice for this movie. The lyrics and overall sound of the song fit the story and pace of the music perfectly. So kudos to them for choosing to re-record it."
__label__1	Warning for other buyers: I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap...
__label__2	Stunning!: I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price.
__label__1	"Where is the Jazz?: I keep reading the reviews here touting this disc for it's ""jazziness"". Needless to say, I am NOT impressed with Ms. Dulfer's lame attempt to overlay her vocals to ""background jazz"" riffs. She is a much better player than this and she is now developing ""Ronnie Laws disease"" - where you believe that vocals are your bread & butter.There are a couple of fine cuts on this disc worth mentioning - specifically ""December""; ""Valdez In The Country""; and the last song ""Lost and Gone"". How ironic....this should probably also be the title of the disc!!!Hopefully, the next disc will provide a more fruitful listening experience. For unadulterated Dulfer Funk - check out ""Live in Amsterdam""....you won't be disappointed."
__label__2	Jungle antics in two languages: Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!
__label__1	Horrible Service: Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
__label__2	New Wave Review: I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. I just purchased a New Wave replacement cartridge for my 2nd year of use. I love that they remind you that it is time to replace the cartridge. I feel I am doing something good for my family with a minimum amount of money. It's worth it.
__label__2	EXCELLENT!: My tap water is so chlorinated that my eyes would burn and my skin would itch when I got out of the shower. For a year I searched for a filter that would not just remove the chlorine odor but actually remove the chlorine! Could not find one until I discovered Enviro. I finally take showers with clean non poisonous water and gases and I'm thrilled. I also got a counter top water filter and its wonderful also since I had been purchasing bottled water before that. Just note that after a while the shower head will start to not remove the chlorine as much so you have to start thinking of replacing it but its a gradual process depending on how often the shower is used and to be expected, so I order a replacement and hold onto it until I feel its ready to change out.
__label__2	great shower filter: It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. I would definitely recommend this filter for anyone. It is very reasonable priced considering how long each filter lasts and is very effective.
__label__2	Good product but.....: Enviro shower chlorine filter is an excellent product. The first time I used it I saw a considerable difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I was so pleased to find out there was a replacement cartridge available for less than half the price of the whole filter. What I don't like about this product is that it leaks. Even after several attempts to reinstall it, it still leaked. Finally, we patched it up with some type of shower tape. And guess what: it still leaks.So I would give five stars for the whole filter but not for the replacement product although it does such a good job of removing chlorine.
__label__1	Don't waste your money on this one!: While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD.
__label__2	More than just John Wayne.: It was funny to see Shirley Temple in her teens. lol I have several movies of her as a little girl and now I have one with her as a young woman.
__label__2	Trilogey: Great action movie with a plot. This completes the series of John Wayne and John Ford westerns about the U.S. Calvery. Great history lesson.
__label__2	Western DVD: John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!I'm not a big Henry Fonda fan, but good because of JW & other cast members.
__label__2	One of the best: Fort Apache is another wonderful example of Fords amazing directing ability! It's a pity that he is still not around to make more of these classic epics.John Wayne does a spectacular job playing Kirby York. A brilliant if somewhat bitter character, who has spent a major portion of his life fighting Indians and is therefore much more aware of the danger of fighting them as if they were civilized soldiers who obey the tactics of war.Henry Ford, as usual does an incredible acting job, as the ignorant Colonel Owen Thursday, who's pride gets him into much more trouble then it's worthI can't say that I actually ever rooted for the Indians (who did a wonderful job of appearing uncivilized) which I suppose is how it's supposed to be :-) And I was highly disappointed that Owen never made it back. Even if he WAS a disagreeable person.Fort Apache is a must see! A GREAT video!
__label__1	Fort Apache in Blu-Ray: I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this movie. This disk was made in Mexico. Itdoes not have the original picture ration. It is only 1:49 I owned this movie on DVD beforeI purchased it in blu-ray. The DVD has retained the original movie display. I will probablytry to find someone who doesn't mind but I won't watch it.
__label__2	Western DVD: This is a good western and really well played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It carries you through a tough time in the relations of our expanding nation and the Indian nations.Chas E. Moser
__label__1	fort apache: The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
__label__2	A wonderful movie: This was the greatest movie! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!
__label__2	another oldie but goodie: First I love John Wayne movies. I remember seeing this one when I was younger and wanted it. I really like the movies where you knew the Stars (not just actors/actresses who are here today for a couple movies and who knows them after that). I also love the movies of the 40s-early 60's as they told stories that you could also use your imagination on. That is not telling/showing me every detail that belongs in the bathroom and bedroom using vulgar language as well.
__label__2	fort apache: John Wayne movies are the best.And with John Ford directing it's even more of a blockbuster.And Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple are great too.
__label__2	"Needed Tightening in the Screenplay: While I like ""Fort Apache,"" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The screenplay to ""Fort Apache"" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, ""Fort Apache"" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like ""Fort Apache"" enough to add it to my collection, as I have ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy."
__label__2	"One of the best: One of my favorite movies! Impressively sharp in blu-ray. Possibly the best of John Fords' ""cavalry trilogy"", the real star is Henry Fonda with John Wayne in a more supporting role. Doesnt appear that the other two movies in the trilogy are yet available in blu-ray, but am looking for them."
__label__2	"Here Comes the Cavalry!: This movie is one part of the ""Cavalry Trilogy"" directed by John Ford. Ya gotta collect all three to get the best of the west from the U.S. Army's perspective. Hey, it's got John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Shirley Temple (all grown up), and introduces handsome John Agar (Shirley Temple's future real-life husband). It's a great movie. If you have not seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen it before, you know what I mean."
__label__2	"FORT APACHE.: ""FORT APACHE"" JOHN WAYNE/JOHN FORD,WHAT A TEAM!! COULDN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH THIS ""PAIRING"" ALL THREE JOHN FORD CAVALRY MOVIES WERE GOOD SOLID ENTERTAINMENT, THE FORD FAMILY WERE A JOY TO WATCH!! THE BLU-RAY BLACK AND WHITE PICTURE TRANSFER IS CRISP. AND THE MONO SOUND IS EXCELLENT, GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!! RECOMMENDED. WOULD LIKE TO SEE ""SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON"" AND ""RIO GRANDE"" ON BLU-RAY, IN FACT ALL' JOHN WAYNE MOVIES ON BLU-RAY, WHY NOT? HE WAS THE GREATEST!!!!!!"
__label__2	A Monumental Movie: Just returned from a trip out west including Monument Valley so I had to order the cavalry trilogy. This film is filled with great characters supporting Fonda & Wayne. The scenery is amazing.This is a spoiler but the ending caught me totally by suprise.If you think you know how the Duke will react in a movie you are dead wrong.Enjoy Shirley Temple, Victor McClauglen, Harry Carey etc. I enjoyed the actor who was Wayne's translator for his parlay with Cochise. I'm pretty sure he was in From Russia with Love too.A must see for Western or Wayne or Ford fans.
__label__2	McQ: Fort Apache is one of my husband's favorite movies, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. He has a very large collection of them on VHS and now he is doing the same thing on DVDs.We both love a mystery, and westerns. If there is a little romance in them to, that is a bonus. Fort Apache is a western and full of adventure and movement. And it also has romance. A very good movie.Lu
__label__2	Fort Apache ( Blu-Ray): Great movie and so glad to see this released to (Blu-Ray). Keep anything of John Wayne's great movies released on (blu-ray) coming as soon as they Available..
__label__1	"You gotta be kidding!: This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. I got into the second mission and thought, ""Is this it?"" From what I can tell, there is only 5 missions. I couldn't take anymore past the second mission.You can't scroll around like in SimCity, Restaurant Empire, etc. It just very one dimensional. If you are looking for a game that doesn't have all the bells and whistles, then this is the game for you."
__label__1	"Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2: I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
__label__1	It's passable: Real Estate Tycoon is just OK. The premise is strong but the graphics and interface are clunky, the sound average, and the business functions are weak. It's a cheap game...you get what you pay for.
__label__1	"Where did the tutorials go?: I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
__label__1	ok game: Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a ok game. kinda hard to figure out.hardly any instruction manual comes with the game only to tell you how to install the game. The game is partly confusing Activision could come up with a better way to make the game more simple. I been a Fan of Trump's for awhile.The gameplay is ok once you figure out how to play.I really didnt like the game that much because it was too complicated and time crawled in the game it could of went faster.
__label__1	Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set): 5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
__label__2	Small but very nice!: I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!
__label__1	Disappointingly tiny: I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. But this one is really too tiny. I couldn't tell from Amazon's picture just how small it was! There may have been an indication of the dimensions in the product description, but I missed it. Perhaps Amazon needs to be more clear about these things.
__label__2	Lauren's 6th birthday: I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. She loves this set and I love the pictures she makes!
__label__2	Very Tiny Stamp Set: I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again.
__label__2	farm animal stamps: looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
__label__1	Not so great.: DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
__label__2	"Great Near Future Hard Science Fiction Anime: Fans of ""Hard"" Science Fiction tend to steer clear of Anime, due to the goofy giant robots and what not. If you are a fan of ""Hard"" Science Fiction, especially in a near-future setting, this series will really impress you.Also note, the interviews with NASA ""orbital debris specialists"" continues on volumes 2 and 3 (I haven't purchased volume 4 yet, so I can't comment)."
__label__2	Great fit: I loved they way they fit and perform. I am an avid outdoors man. They handle the snow, ,mud and tree branches great. Would recommend this product to anyone with pets or outdoors person.
__label__2	good series: Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
__label__2	Good DVD, but... No subtitles!: I'm a Brazilian train fan and I bought this DVD because Amazon said it was closed captioned... but not. No english subtitles for my better understanding and international customers.Positives: Image quality (DVD), DVD structure, good value.Negatives: No subtitles and too much narration... sometimes unnecessary.Obs.: A blue-ray version would be nice... with subtitles, of course!
__label__2	Great view of trains from behind the surface: This is a great DVD that shows how trains run, all the people it takes to make things happen, etc. Yes, the host is a little overly enthusiastic/in your face, but this series is very informative/educational. I especially liked the comparison of today's railroad operations with how the railroad routes were constructed. For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV. Each episode is about 45 minutes (8 episodes in all) so you can plug this DVD in and watch something good while you're waiting for your next favorite show to come on. Enjoy!
__label__1	EXTREMEly obnoxious: The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it.
__label__1	Black?: The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. It's not much fun and the picture isn't as good as some. Not an enjoyable experience at all - and we love puzzles!
__label__2	"Preaching as Storytelling-Par Excellence: Dr. Napier was my primary Old Testament professor and mentor at Yale Divinity School and ""Come Sweet Death"" comprised some of his imaginative chapel sermons in which he marvelously moves from the Biblical text into our cultural/social arena, applying the truths of Genesis to us. One must have some awareness of the Genesis text and scholarship of Gerhard von Rad and his American disciples, of whom Davie Napier is one; but Napier goes beyond von Rad in his interpretive skills and possesses unique insights. I use it as a resource text in my university/theological seminary courses. A must for the Biblical interpreter in a time when our sermons and commentaries are so flat and unexciting."

__label__1	Every paint was dried up: I purchased this a month ago for my daughter for Christmas. She just opened them to decorate the shoes this morning and every single paint except the light blue is completely dried up inside of the tube. She is disappointed and I am annoyed.
__label__1	smells bad: Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend
__label__1	Disappointed.: I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already.
__label__2	Fair Meets Sun: I'm practically an albino so I've had no luck with this type of product until now. The coloring is gradual and looks like a light base golden brown and has a nice scent. Good as it gets.
__label__1	Oompa Loompa: I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult.
__label__2	Fake Bake Tan: Being fair skinned, this is the perfect product to give my skin a little color without the damaging UV rays! Love it!!
__label__2	Clear, Concise Overview of Essential Grammar Points: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People.
__label__2	Excellent! Made college freshman English less frustrating: I use it and recommend it to many of my fellow students that are wading their way through college. Especially great for any international folk...the English language is a crazy beast.
__label__2	Real dazzler: Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. I have always been a rock fan except for Albert Lee. His music is so well done and just plain pleasant to listen to that it draws me right in. His guitar skills are as good as anyone in the buisness. His guitar is always there but never overpowering. This CD contains material I originally bought on record more years ago than I'd care to admit. It still sounds as fresh and clean as it did all those years ago. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for dazzling guitar work with a country flavor. His choice of material os first rate and the recording quality of the CD is also first rate. Buy this thing and you'll like it.
__label__2	An Outstanding Read: An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book.

Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song."""
__label__2	"Straight to the point: ""Seduce Me"" is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. ""Seduce Me"" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."
__label__1	Disappointed: I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested. Believe it or not, some women have higher sex drives than their man. If you're a man needing some help with your partner, this is a good read. For a woman needing help with her man -- keep looking -- this book is not for you.
__label__2	"Seduction Scenes - A Definite Turn On: When I started reading the Seduction Scenes chapter I felt that sexual tingle of excitement...just by reading it I was turned on! I thought that part of me was dead. After being married for almost 17 years with two active boys, I find it difficult to take the time to really enjoy sex like we used to do. Lately, it has been nothing but ""quickies"" so that I can sleep! Both my husband and I are looking forward to experimenting more with the Seduction Scene Strategies and Role Playing. I was telling my girlfriend about the book and she can't wait to read it!"
__label__1	Not Much New Here: I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources. And frankly, I think there's just nothing new here.
__label__2	Bunyan's Allegory: This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.
__label__1	Poor Quality: The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.
__label__1	Bad ink?: Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description.
__label__2	The book of my life: I have read this book once already and I am reading it agian right now. It is the most inspiring and motivating book that I have ever read. It seems that every time that I am loosing the sight of my spiritual path this book seems to pop up. I love it and recommend to every one, no matter if they are a spiritual person or not.
__label__2	A Story For Everybody: This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all.
__label__2	Very nice quality.: I have not read the book as of yet, but just wanted to let people know how substantial this book really is. It is about the size and weight of a large dictionary. While not the best for portability, it is definitely a keepsake or collector type of book. It even has it's own ribbon style bookmark built in. Can't wait to read it.
__label__1	Dumb: basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind.
__label__1	"Puritanism at its best.: This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
__label__2	a must-get for the battle of geonosis!: My son just got interested in collecting star wars action figures. He found this figure new in the case at a CD store in Greenville, SC. He has really enjoyed using this figure to recreate the battle of geonosis from Attack of the clones. It is also good for Dooku's final battle against Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. The only problem is the the paint on his lightsaber handle wears off easily. But it is a very good toy and an excellant addition to any star wars or action figure collection.
__label__2	This is a good product: A good product, but costs a bit too much. I needed this and couldn't find it in any of the stores around where I live.
__label__2	Great game for toddlers: This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
__label__2	My sick dog needed a supplement- these work !: My miniature schnauzer (11.75 years old) has congestive heart failure, and won't eat any of the prescription dog foods. So, she gets unsalted people food (ground meats, rice, oatmeal, and various baby food fruits and veggies). I wanted to be sure she got enough of the vitamins and minerals that I can't really figure out, so got these. She won't eat them (but she won't eat anything 'dog' except Charlee Bear treats), but when I crush them and put them in applesauce, she doesn't spit them out. That's a win around here these days... :/
__label__2	Good quality: Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn't like them too much. He ate them, but not enthusiastically.
__label__1	Great collection - horrible quality: As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here.
__label__2	"Still great after all these years!: I played this album so much in high school I wore the ink off the cassette tape! I probably hadn't heard it for 15 years, but when I popped in the CD I was singing along word for word again right away. Not that it's earth shakingly original, but this album is so much fun to listen to, and that's what's really more important. Tight, funky musicianship, a great party album and excellent remastering. ""Lasershow"" hasn't aged well, but everything else - the classic title track, ""Free Yourself,"" ""I Spy For The FBI"" and my personal favorite ""Piece Of Your Love"" - still gets you dancing. Glad to finally have a copy of ""Stepping Stone"" again, and the other B sides - especially ""Whiplash"" and ""Shine On"" - are great too.If you're reading this review, you know this is a lost '80s classic. Don't wait any longer - get it back in your collection!"
__label__1	This Is A Regretable Mistake: The persons responsible for the concept and production of this recording should not be let loose in a recording studio again. That Christy Baron should acquiese to such drivel is beyond comprehension. That Chesky Records would allow it to be released should be a felony.C'mon. Electronics, sampling, throat singing? Were any gimmicks spared on this production?
__label__1	Won't fit a 2000 gsxr600!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 has 3 bolts on the motor side, the pipe for 2001-2003 has 4 bolts, the holes don't line up. If you buy this pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 it WON'T FIT!!!!!!!
__label__2	"Last Of The Mohicans: This entire CD is on the one. Of course ""Atomic Dog"" is the main cut, however ""Man's Best Friend"" is also a funky type of ""Knee Deep"" groove. ""Loopzilla"" is also a good song to dance to. The title cut ""Computer Games"" is as crazy as the artist. LOL. However, this album has a Funkadelic overtone. With musicians like Bootsy, Bernie, Mike, Junie, Eddie Hazel, Garry Shider and ect ect. it's worth buying. I think this is the best George Clinton album of all time. It's a R&B; Clssid and for the life of me I don't understand why it did not make the national top 40. Even the title cut went to 80 something on the charts. Go figure. George did get a award for the best video of that year.Go for ur funk"
__label__2	"Believe in Atomic Dog: Clinton's contributions to popular music are practically limitless; perhaps most importantly, he kept waving his freak flag high long after most musicians caved in to their labels' demand for conformity. Computer Games showcases his talent for squeezing archetypal beats and riffs out of his ever-changing cadre of musicians. Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour. Try to keep from playing ""Where did I hear that sampled?"" and just let the funk wash you up and away to Clinton's psychedelic, sexed-up Disneyland. Every track's a winner."
__label__2	"Loopzillacious!: ""Atomic Dog"" is so cold that after all these years party people still hurry to the dance floor on it--I've even seen't kcowboys line dancin' and doin' the Cotton-Eyed Joe on it. I guess evvy stray dawg will have his day and evvy computer playa will have a game. Thanx, Dr. Clinton, for programming this p-funky entropy."
__label__1	Boring - Not a Good Version: I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. However, this one is my least favorite. The actress who plays Emma rather grated on my nerves and I did not enjoy her performance at all. I would not recommend this one.
__label__2	Engaging Period Piece: This Austen adaptation is a joy and a gem in spite of its low production values. Thickly British.
__label__2	delightfull miniseries with low production values: this miniseries is about a young matchmaker in regancy england who gets in involved everyones business. the performance are good but the production values are horbil and the costumes are very plain. but it is pretty good and is very faitfull to jane austens classic book.
__label__1	Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!: Anyone who knows the book knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she's between 40 to 45 years old?Isn't this actress in this 70's BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20's?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.
__label__1	Bleh!: Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it.
__label__2	You will be rewarded if you stick with it: The production values of this early 1970's BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself. The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking. Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation. Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing. The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening. In fact I would have given this five stars if the first episode was as good as the rest. Well worth spending the money to enjoy this classic adaptation of Emma.
__label__1	Worst Emma ever: Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth.
__label__1	Emma as a deer in headlights!: While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh! It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version.
__label__2	"Great reading and excellent story!: ""Haunted Summer"" is a great book for young teens and adults, too! It is a story of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized. I was very surprised by the circumstances, but can understand why Marilla had a choice to make. Read to see why the story is so fascinating. You will learn a lesson about yourself in the process, too."
__label__2	Easy and fast to use: Great stuff and it works fast and easy. Not meant to refinish your kitchen, this is for Furniture only. Wear gloves and use outside or in a well ventilated area.
__label__1	Not as easy to use as stated: Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. I am very disappointed and will need to use something to bring the table to life again!
__label__1	thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high: I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!
__label__1	Never again: I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. I bought everything that was recommended to use, the steel wool pads and the chemical gloves. This product ate through all the gloves we used, it disolved one of my friends acrylic fingernails, it felt like it was ice-burning our skin, made us all light-headed in a ventilated room and it barely did any improvements to my cabinets. I am concerned about us all absorbing this into our skin and any effect that may cause. I am returning all of the cans and I am VERY disappointed in this product.
__label__1	"O Brother Fans Beware!: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
__label__2	Incisive and indicting: A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Guaranteed discussion starter.
__label__1	Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography: Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy.
__label__1	"lame photos and dreary topic: This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
__label__2	Eerily amazing: When I first saw this book in my photo class, I thought the images were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn't read the text with all the pictures. When I bought it for myself, and got to read everything, it gave me even more of a respect for this work. Her snips of these girls lives rattle and amaze you at the same time. I love this book so much, and I think every girl/woman should look at it.
__label__2	The product is good but the price isn't!: The product itself is very good. I bought it very frequently from amazon.com since my baby was born.But recently amazon.com raised the price from $7.49 to $10.49 which is much higher than any other grocery stores. Like in Target, the price is only $9.44!If amazon.com still maintains this highest price for this product, the customers like me will go to other stores for sure!
__label__2	Cool!: When Claudia baby sits for the Rodowsky family, She and Shea become friends. they are both not good at spelling. they help each other in spelling. Nut stacey almost ruins Claudia and Stacey's friendship.
__label__2	ANOTHER GREAT CD: 4 STARS BECAUSE it sounded fine but not as great as other string quartets.I like this because the string quartet 2 uses 2 cellos.,1 violin,1 viola which was interesting.You can hear the cello more than in the other string quartets with 2 violins.This also another rare CD at a simple price.
__label__1	Lack of Sensitivity: Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so.
__label__2	"Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family: If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
__label__2	"I can't believe it's not butter!: It's hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives ""the performance of a lifetime"", which in his case, after seeing ""Superman"", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre Laúd is execrable and Mássimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival. All in all, much ado about... butter!"
__label__1	"Last Tango In Paris: The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. The Hayes Commission version is edited for content to the point the film loses it's provocative edge, with out which is disjointed (pun intended) and boring. I've looked elsewhere for the original release version which at the time was X rated, but now all I see is the ""R"" rating which means all the good scenes are cut out!But I'll Keep looking. It's a real hot classic in it's original formRapscallion"
__label__1	"Overrated: Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."
__label__2	Great Movie: This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work.
__label__1	Last Tango in Paris: Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
__label__1	Don't buy it!: I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one.
__label__1	"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated: Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
__label__1	Stupid movie: When this movie first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. The plot was silly and Brando's acting was awful.
__label__1	Unbelievably Stupid: How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in movie history. Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time.
__label__2	"Be A Dear And Pass The Butter Please!!!: In this movie we see Malon Brando as an ageing oversexed man who embarks on a liason with a young woman played by Maria Schieder. That is about the whole plot and storyline for this movie. In this film Mr. Brando finds a very inventive use for butter which does not involve making a sandwich. He is once said to have remarked that ""acting is a bum's life"" so if you want to see a bum at work I suggest you watch this movie. I give this film 5 stars because Maria Schnieder thankfully went into movie obscurity after making his film."
__label__1	Last Tango In Paris: I though the film was terrible. Brando mumbled in French and the plot was unrealistic. I purchased the film to see how sexualism has changed over the years, since this was touted to be the first of expicit sexual scenes.
__label__1	They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY: There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
__label__1	"BS Detector Hits ""11"": Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
__label__2	Highly intellectal and emotional multi-plotted story.: What can one say about such a powerful story? Is it about love? Is it about irony? Is it about lust? Is it about loss? What is it all about? That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man. It's a masterpiece!
__label__1	trash masquerading as art: Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess.
__label__2	Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.
__label__2	worth seeing: While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective.
__label__1	A movie that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. It can be fast-forwarded to the end without anything being missed. Alas, poor Brando, we knew him well.
__label__1	One long WTF? moment.: We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal.
__label__2	Classic Marlon Brando Movie.....: I read the mixed reviews for this movie, so I had to comment. This movie is classic. The storyline may offend some people, but come on. Life is rocky, and believe me, going over the rocks with Marlon Brando would be a pleasure. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1972, and I still enjoy it today in 2010. Tango anyone??
__label__1	"Unappealing and unnecessarily perverted: I went into this film thinking that I would see an unorthodox film involving sex. I've seen many films that could fit this description such as ""Happiness"" by Todd Solondz and ""Romance"" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating."
__label__1	"nothing of value: It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered ""art"" and ""decent"". To me, it was just a monumental waste of time, like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci's work."
__label__1	Can't be that great.: I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it.
__label__1	Couldn't wait for it to be over!: I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back.
__label__1	This is a great film?: Let me get this straight. The story starts with a man and a woman, strangers looking at vacant apartment. They walk around a bit, say a few words, then he grabs her and they go to it. Nothing is given to justify this, no romance, no chemistry, no flirting, not even lustful looks. It is as if two people just ran into each other on the street and went straight at it. This is great film making? On what planet?
__label__1	Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time: Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie.
__label__1	A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY: This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.
__label__2	"Unforgettable: Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
__label__1	Twisted and boring: The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters. Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I didn't like but couldn't leave. Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film.
__label__1	Extremely disappointing: This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time.
__label__2	3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago.
__label__1	Materpiece that needs an overhall: faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
__label__1	Depressing, Despicable and Down-right Disgusting: Marlon Brando was one of the most overrated actors of all time. Anyone who knows about his personal life and still thinks he was a respectable person should have their head examined. The fact that he was comfortable with this awful role says enough about the kind of man he was. Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough. The story and soundtrack couldn't even come close to saving this trash either.
__label__1	"Quite possibly the worst movie in cinematic history: Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. On the DVD case, a reviewer squeals: ""The most erotically powerful movie ever made!"" Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."
__label__1	what's the big deal?: This has to be the most overrated movie ever made. Even by 1970's standards, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Marlon Brando is just his usual brooding self. The girl is extremely beautiful, but even if she was naked through the entire movie, I cannot understand why anyone considers this a cinema masterpiece.
__label__2	Great bindings, good commentaries: We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; Coriolanus
__label__1	Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes: I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle.
__label__2	Great composition: Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but reading the real, written work is another world. It is a different way to think of the story you know. I bought this compilation to read all of Shakespeare's works and it is truly great. One thing I'd advise is that you know how to read scripts. This book is written as Shakespeare wrote his plays. Though, every work is prefaced with the characters names and role they play, it can still be a bit difficult to get through because of the way it's written.Jul. Then, window let day in and let life out.Rom.Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.[descendsJul.Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!It can become a bit much.I gave it four stars because it has such small font: around 8 or 9 px font you'd find on MS word.
__label__2	An heirloom for every American: As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls. Beautifully assembled, this keepsake will instill pride in its citizenry. Making selections from myriad possibilities must have been a dire undertaking, but those represented indicate a fair cross-section of time and geography. An excellent tribute to a worthy source!
__label__1	Not a good value for the price: Given the price of this book, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Too little information for a hardcover book that supposed to be a guide for manufacturers on how to implement TOC.
__label__2	"Funk Music and Sufism: The music of Mercan Dede, or with his other name DJ Alan Arkin, is taking us to a travel in the land of Sufism. I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song ""Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi"", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. ""Walking on the Red Sea"", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do."
__label__2	Exciting Action and Adventure: I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. It's been years since I read a historical novel that was so well written. But do yourself a favor, read Into the Wilderness first. I found myself wondering so much about references to things that happened in the first book that I just had to search for it to read. And I wasn't disappointed. But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels. It's like Elizabeth can never catch a break. I am now eagerly awaiting the paperback printing of Lake in The Clouds. I plan to pass these books on as a set, to anyone I know who is into historical novels.
__label__2	Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!: This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters. (A deeper view) I kept turning the pages wanting more, and was rewarded. When all is said and done with this series, this book in paticular will have a special place with me. It's a delight!
__label__1	Into the Wilderness It's NOT: I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition.
__label__2	Great series: It can be a little slow at times but I have enjoyed this series and fallen in love with many of the characters. I would recommend.
__label__2	Captiating!: Cannot put it down, just like the rest of the series. Moments of emotion, suspense, happiness and sadness. The story just gets better and better.
__label__2	On a trip: The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other.
__label__2	"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I had read Donati's series of six Wilderness books and really liked them so I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she had read the first one and liked it. They are long books but never boring. I thought the book would be a larger size, as the soft cover ""Into the Wilderness"" had a bigger cover with a little larger print but the book came quickly, was reasonably priced, and my daughter is happy to receive it. Donati is a really good writer. I only discovered her this year. - Fran"
__label__2	DDS...a roller coaster ride!: This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!
__label__2	"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I found ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland. It continued with the lifes of the Bonner family and close friends and brought back some characters from the past that added more intrigue. I read through it quickly because I couldn't put it down. Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean."
__label__2	Lovely Romance: The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. I loved following the budding romance.
__label__1	Not Worth My Time: I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me.
__label__2	A Strong 4.5 Stars: This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book.
__label__1	Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters.
__label__1	"I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.: I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"
__label__1	"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I ""skimmed"" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."
__label__1	Yawn on Distant Shore.....: I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was.
__label__1	The story falls over: The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place.
__label__1	Yawn.: I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!
__label__1	Disappointed: Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
__label__1	Not as good as her other books: I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better.
__label__2	Much Better than the first: This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!
__label__1	Good, but I expected more: After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license.
__label__2	"An excellent read!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate ""fluff"", then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading."
__label__1	"Very disappointing!!!: I was so thrilled with vol. 1 ""Into the Wilderness"" that I ordered the second volume from the library before investing money into a hardcover version. I'm glad I didn't buy one as it was the most disappointing book since I read Kate Morton.""Into the Wilderness"" was so promising and I really wonder how the sequel can be so shallow?This whole journey from Montréal, Canada, to Dumfries, Scotland, used up close to 300 pages in the book and when Nathaniel and Elizabeth are finally in Scotland, things don't get any more interesting.What a boring read!Zero stars was not possible, so I have to give it 1 star :(.I hope ""Lake in the Clouds"" will be better, but if it's only about Hannah, I doubt I will read it.I was hoping to read more about Nathaniel and Elizabeth."
__label__2	"review: I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
__label__2	A devoted reader!!: When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!!!
__label__1	dawn on a distant shore: Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work.
__label__1	A boring disappointment!: Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money.
__label__1	"Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read ""Into the Wilderness"" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author."
__label__1	BORING!: Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon.
__label__2	Nice value tent: Easy set up overall. Wish the bottom was lined with tarp instead of nylon.Good roomy ceiling. Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.
__label__2	"Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
__label__2	perfect campground tent: You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get.
__label__2	Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
__label__1	Beware - Product is not as pictured: While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch.
__label__2	In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart.
__label__2	If only real women were like this . . .: _The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this. But, one can always hope that there are still a few out there.
__label__1	over-rated!: poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
__label__1	Hard to feel anything for the characters: This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience.
__label__2	"Amazing: I love horror/thriller movies but rarely ever get frightened from them. This movie was great. I was genuinely scared. I think that this movie has the best ""monsters"" in a long time. Definitely getting it for my dvd collection."
__label__2	Awesome: This is probably the most effective horror movie I have ever seen. The all female cast does a phenomenal job of keeping the audiences attention (and no there is no nudity). Shows what a talented director and cast can do with little money and a good story. Has more scares and is more entertaining than the majority of horror that is released in theatres.
__label__2	TRULY SCARY - Blu-ray Perfection!: I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!
__label__1	A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out.
__label__1	Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel?: If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did.
__label__1	boring. boring. and....yes boring.: I don't know what type of movies these people watch but this movie was NOT scary, it had NO suspense, and was just plain boring. I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring.
__label__1	"Kind of lame, as most horror movies are: I'm not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch ""The Descent"" with her, and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy ""The Descent"" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."
__label__1	"Boring movie with good Blu-ray features: THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in ""behind the scenes"" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes. I bought it for ten bucks at Wal-mart and I guess it was worth that for the cool features on the Blu-ray but I sure feel ugly and bored after watching it all."
__label__1	It could have been really good...but: Some things were good, but more were bad, here's a run down of the positive and the negative:(+)side:1.the setting of an underground cave2.couple moments that make you jump3.great concept(-)side:1.story2.cast3.troll creatures4.tried to take itself too seriously
__label__1	"ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!: Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
__label__1	"The Descent?: Almost a full hour into this movie before you see what the movie is even supposed to be about. It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of ""horror"" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like ""Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles"". If your going to advertise a movie as ""scary"" and ""horror"" than MAKE IT LIKE ONE. This is just a chick flick with some ""BOO!s"" tossed in towards the end, stay away from this failed flick."
__label__2	"Chicks with Accents in America!: This movie is a little dated. I am sure it scared the every loving be-jesus out of folks when it came out. That said, its still scary! It will keep your interest thats for sure. Hey- we are talking 6 foxy chicks going into a cave to crawl around. What guys interest does that not hold? Chicks will enjoy the female choas of the group. There are a couple of scenes that will unsettle even the most stone faced horror show movie goer. Oh- the funny thing about this movie is that all the chicks have British accents. Not sure how this happens, but it adds to the charm of these chicks crawling around the cave. ""Is anyone injured?"", vs (American)""Are you OK?"". Its worth buying, and seeing a couple a times."
__label__2	3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Without question the best horror film to come out in the last decade (not that it's had much competition), The Descent takes a little time to develop an interesting (and all female) group of friends before plunging them into a situation that would be terrifying enough even if there weren't creatures to worry about; if you like horror and haven't seen this film then you should be ashamed.Note: Please watch the unrated version/Director's cut for a much better ending
__label__2	A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this. Excellent horror adventure.
__label__1	"Another one bites the dust..: Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
__label__1	Bad!: The first DVD I received had no disc! The second one I received was packaged fine but halfway through the movie it had static, skipped, etc. Very poor quality.
__label__1	"THIS SUCKS: THIS IS THE STUPIDIEST MOVIE EVER MADE. AND THOSE WHO SAY IT IS A GREAT MOVIE SHOULD HAVE THEIR HEADS EXAMINE. A GANG OF BORED WOMEN WITH NOTHING TO DO WIT THEIR LIVES GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO BE EATEN BY SOME UNDERGROUND ALBINO, BLIND CREATURES THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM.ONE, FOR WONEN WITH EDUCATION ( DOCTORS, LAWYERS,ETC.) THEIR VOCABULARY IS VERY LINITED TO FOUR LETTER WORDS. SECOND, CLICHE ALL OVER THE PLACE, ONE OF THEM IS THE ""'DUH' I'M FOR EVERYTHING"" CHARACTER, ANOTHER ONE IS THE ""SENSITIVE' I LOST MY HUSBAND"" PERSON, ANOTHER IS THE "" I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING"" PERSON, AND THE REST WISHY-WASHY. HALF WITTED GROUO THAT DO NOT QUESTION.THE END IS PREDICTABLE ""!LISTEN PEOPLE! NO-ONE IS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN. DUH.....IT STOLE STORY-LINES FROM GOOD HORROR MOVIES LIKEW ALIEN FOR INSTANCEIF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS TO THIS MOVIE; BELIEVE, I WOULD"
__label__1	DUMB!: This movie is a bunch of nonsense. A group of girls (rolls eyes) explores a cave in the U.S.A. (rolls eyes again) with aliens living in it (rolls eyes a third time). DUMB. I can not believe all the good reviews I have read. They must all be from the production staff.
__label__1	horror for ten year olds: Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about.
__label__1	LOUSY: This movie was about an inch of me gonging it. It was like I was in the cave watching it. I plan to sell it to Blockbuster because it is not worthy to be in my collection.The best part was the end.
__label__1	Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and: Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and....
__label__1	FAIR: THE MOVIE FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. I KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOU TO KNOW THE CHARCTERS IN THE BEGINNING. THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DID KNOW ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK THE CHARCTERS WERE STRONG ENOUGH. MAYBE THEY NEEDED STRONGER ACTRESSES LIKE SIGOURNY WEAVER, LINDA HAMILTON EVEN ANGELA BASSET. BUT THE MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS. IT'S GOOD TO WATCH, AND IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON WHEN YOU HAVE MOVIE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS. :-)
__label__1	descent into stupidity: I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
__label__1	SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!: I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!
__label__1	Disappointing hollywood formula ending: Buyer beware. This is a version with a feel good hollywood formula ending. It is not the original, it was redone to give the US viewers a somewhat happy and typical USA horror ending / resolution, (pretty symbolic of our countries state I would say). Get the European version. I bought this thing w/o realizing they redid it, now I am buying the original---
__label__1	Don't waste your time...: What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?
__label__2	"I never get scared, BUT!!!: I thought that The Ring was funny when that girl came out of the TV. I still get a kick out of how ""not scary"" that was. The Grudge made me cackle with joy when the hairy ghost girl emerged, how funny! Nothing seem to scare me in theatre anymore, except for this movie. I didnt really know what it was about when I saw it, and I atually got goose bumps. It combines good acting with many types of horror. The horror of being trapped in a cave system and then finding out you are not alone in there! There are times when you feel your heart pace quicken because of the tight situations. Basically, just watch it and dont watch it alone! Make sure its dark and enjoy!"
__label__2	good movie: I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies.
__label__2	good movie: It is worth to watch, good story, scaring but also attractive, should it is very good for friends' gathering, all ppl watch together
__label__2	good: Its a great movie for jumps and scares and the story is not that bad. I have a high end system and the audio is pretty awesome as it helps convey the Scary elements. The picture is good on my HD TV but not the best I've seen. Its a great movie to pop on a rainy night especially enjoyed on a good surround sound system!
__label__2	Terrorific Extreme Adventuring: When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure.
__label__2	good all the way thru: Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
__label__2	Better than expected.: Not bad! Worth the watch! The monsters or whatever were a little weird but oh well, still some scary stuff.
__label__2	I'm not going spelunking!: If ever a movie made me want to stay out of dark caves this one is it. Love the creepy dark surprises.
__label__2	A good flick: This is a good modern take on a wonderful H.P. Lovecraft story. The claustrophobic element is great, the cinematography is good and the story keeps you entertained.
__label__2	Stay Far Away from Caves: Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
__label__1	Not bad for a budget movie: I thought they did a good job with makeup in the movie but the script and the way it was directed was not typical for a movie of this type. Made it feel more budget.
__label__2	What a movie....: This movie was very very good, but confusing at the end. It is a great scare, most will enjoy the movie. Be ready for a fright night! Enjoy!
__label__1	Waste of Time: READ THE BOOK!!! This is just a horribly pieced together slasher film. The book is a really good read, don't see this unless you're trying to scare your eight ear old sibling.
__label__2	"The Descent: This is quite simply one of the best horror movies ever made. And this comes from a person who watches almost nothing but horror every day. Never has a movie been so bleak since ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". Neil Marshall first made his mark on ""Dog Soldiers"", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing. This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite, ever made."
__label__2	"The Descent.: A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."
__label__2	The Descent: This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much.
__label__2	"WOW Great movie!!: I could just say ""WOW"" and leave it at that! If you like scary movies, movies with lots of action, and movies that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD......well, then buy this movie!! It has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies!!"
__label__1	Descent Review: I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also.
__label__1	No turkey just a STINKER: Wow- i remember renting this when it first came out, and probably would have both excited and scared me if i was 12, ok maybe 13 or even 14. Beyond predictable, and the scary stuff was just smoke and mirrors to me. Really a waste of time as I have seen better B plots. Filmography was decent but that was about it
__label__1	BORED AT ALL...: I SAW THE MOVIE BUT IT'S BORED AT ALL. ALSO IT'S NOT ENJOYMENT. THE CREATURE WAS STRANGE AND DISGUSTING. I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD-LOOKINGBUT IT WAS NOT. ANYWAY THIS MOVIE WAS A FAILURE.
__label__1	disappointing: I didn't find the Descent to be a very interesting film. It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere.
__label__1	"one star and one jump: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
__label__1	One of the worse horror films ever made.: Just finished watching this movie and the best thing about it is it finally ended.Slow, boring, and extremely gory with uninteresting characters tied to a script filled with cliches. That about does it except if you're having trouble sleeping do watch it since it's a wonderful cure for insomnia.
__label__1	Trash...utter trash: After getting about five minutes into this movie, I was wondering why I should care. I was wondering the same thing at fifteen minutes, half an hour, an hour, and all the way through the end.Frankly, I was bored, I thought the suspense was completely transparent, the characters unbelievable, and the acting mediocre at best.Complete waste of time. Watch paint dry instead. You'll thank yourself.
__label__1	HORRIBLE. PLAIN HORRIBLE....: I have nothing good to say about this movie as it made no sense at all execpt that the female's British accents were cool.
__label__1	"Well, that was terrible...: I'm disapointed that I'm never getting back the 99 minutes of my life I wasted on watching ""The Descent."" It's just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, ""Feast"" (horror/sci fi). This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN'T watch. VERY predictable...tried working off of sheer gore...and when that didn't work...well...I was kind of cheering for them all to die. ;-)The best part about this movie:I didn't pay to rent it, my sister did! Hahahaha...P.S. PICK SOMETHING ELSE...ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS IS BETTER!"
__label__1	Desucked: If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
__label__1	Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut.
__label__2	Pretty creepy: I had hopes for this one and it delivered. I liked how I was never sure what to expect, even though some elements were typical of suspenseful/horror movies. It was gory enough to make me cringe, and creative in that it isn't an unbeatable super-monster based tale. I like the ending, and would like to see the alternate, as well. Really good stuff!
__label__2	"Intense: Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely ""The Descent 2,"" will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!"
__label__2	"Take ""The Descent"" into a realm of pure terror!: If you are tired of those lame, ineffective horror movies that have been advertised to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you to death, take a look at ""The Descent"" for a fresh new look on this view.This movie WILL terrify you beyond all belief. You will find yourself just as scared as the victims in this movie. You will be clenching onto the nearest item in anticipation for what is going to happen next. Because, trust me, you really have no idea what will happen next.I found myself practically leaping out of my seat in terror. And, trust me everyone, that RARELY happens. I go through most movies with a whatever attitude and don't show any fear. I make it through movies like The Exorcist without breaking a sweat. However, this movie had me wondering what was going to happen and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time.Once again, IF you want that horror film that will not let you down in the slightest bit, pick up ""The Descent"" today."
__label__2	"a veritable masterpiece: neil marshal's The descent"" is a great movie.the outline is as follows.six girlfriends go caving only to find out they are not alone in the cave.what follows is a fast paced adrenaline fueled thrill ride that grabs you by the throat and won't let go.there are many scary moments in the film.there is a nice buildup of suspense before the creatures are revealed, and once they are, they are terrifying.the acting is good and there characters are well developed in the early stages of the film(before the caving scenes).you may be out of breath before this one ends.if you get scared easy, you may want to watch this movie with someone or you might not get through it,as it is intense.i liked the twist ending, which sets up nicely for a sequal.i saw the britsh version, in which the ending apparrently differs from the north american.i can't wait to check out the north american version to compare.you have to check out this movie. 5* out of 5"
__label__2	Finally, a decent horror movie: This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. It's about time they made a horror movie with strong female leads that doesn't degrade them or use them as eye candy dangled in front of a sadistic killer.This movie had a lot of layers to its characters and the creatures were freaking scary!
__label__2	Above grade: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded.
__label__1	Dark and Confusing: I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two.
__label__1	Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!
__label__2	The difference between unrated and regular version: First of all let me say i really enjoyed this movie. Not like a regular slasher. Its very good. I actually seen it at the show. Now the main difference that no one has listed out of all these reviews is, just the ending. I didnt see any more gore than was at show. Something unrated doesnt always mean extra gore or sex. Anyway just the ending is different than one that was seen in US theatres. I wont spoil ending for you if you havent seen, but most know from youtube what its really suppose to be. Anyway pick this movie up and add it to your collection. Its a keeper!
__label__2	Creepy Cave Trips Are Never a Good Idea: This movie is scary. This group of women thinks it is fun to go on annual adventure trips. I prefer a nice hotel on the beach, but creepy crawly caves sound better to them. You really get to know the characters and care about them and the things they have been through. It is their trip to the caves and what they go through there that will terrify you. If you are claustrophobic, you will definitely be freaked out by this movie. I love a good scary movie, which may be why I am an insomniac, and this movie is well written and acted and will give you the creeps. I highly recommend it. Power Path to Love
__label__2	"Great Horror movie!: I love horror movies. Unfortunatly, it's hard for me to find any that actually scare me. ""The descent"", however, does a fantastic job. I popped it into my DVD player with the average expectations of a ""horror"" movie set in caves with girls as the protagonists. About halfway in though, when the ""monsters"" finally showed up, (with a very creepy introductory view from down a tunnel) I was pressed into my couch as far as I could go, arms around knees, and intently watching every moment of the movie.I have never squealed like a girl while watching a horror movie, but ""The Descent"" evoked several from me, and I was thankful to be watching it without witnesses!I highly recommend ""The Descent"" to anyone seeking a scary movie!"
__label__2	Amazing.: 2006 has been packed with PG-13 horror films, lots of them. Then are the gore flicks (TCM the beginning), and other stuff. Finally, a good horror movie comes out in august: THE DESCENT, a British horror film with a good twist.STORY: One year after a car accedent, 6 women reunite in a cabin in the Appilachian mountains to Go on a caving expedition. When they arrive at the cave, the descent into the cave begins, and their exit is blocked. They keep praying and pushing, hoping for another exit, but a bunch of deadly creatures attack...THOUGHTS: THis is a cool movie. Good music, great s/fx, and great lighting, I thought it was cool that the only light was natural.SO see this film!
__label__2	The Descent Blu-ray Review: I already have this movie on DVD, but like it so much that I ordered it on Blu-ray too. I am very impressed with the quality of the HD. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an original horror flick! I also continue to be impressed with Amazon's excellent service and quality products.
__label__2	"Well cast, intense, and suprisingly unconventional: This movie could have easily been an inane, repititious, piece of garbage. Just cast one, or more, of US Weekly/STAR/TMZ's latest darlings. Let 'em stumble through the film with mediocre acting skills- but perfect hair and make up! The pay off? Why those opening weekend box office returns of course!Instead, ""The Descent"" takes the road less traveled, no pun intended. The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well. Altruistic and nurturing one minute, egomaniacal and totally aloof the next.The film exploits a common phobia; being trapped, enclosed places, etc., by showing us the most extreme and terrifying scenario. And it works! This movie is chillingly intense."
__label__1	Blows!!!: As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money.
__label__1	CAVE-DWELLING SLASHER FLICK: My expectations were very high when I bought this DVD. The first 45 minutes of the movie were a little slow, but seemed to be building up some momentum. The first 15 minutes of cave diving with the bush league spilunkers was OK!. After that, the flick just turned into another slasher movie in a cave. The darkness added little and the plastic vampires were a little too stupid to watch. Nothing more than a slashers flick! What a total disappointment.
__label__1	"Horrible film.: This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
__label__1	BOOOOOORRRING!!!!: Until now, there was some debate aboutPlan 9 from Outer Spacebeing the worst movie ever made. Well, the debate is over...The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)wins that prize hands down! There's definitely something wrong with a movie when you find yourself rooting for the monsters more than the victims. And how come all the monsters look like mindless male brutes? Hmmm...Thank goodnes for the FAST FORWARD button, and even more thanks for the STOP button. Now, if I can just find the FORGET button!
__label__1	overated and robbed: Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. Perhaps its me, I am retard! but I felt I was robbed of time. I found it lacked story, and the moral of the story was odd. ok, in the end, the main character dreamed it all--did she? The Journey to the Centre of the Earth had much more imagination and charm by the rope length!
__label__1	This is a joke!!: I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Needless to say once I started watching it, I was bored for the first hour. Then these ridiculous looking monsters appear out of nowhere.ABSOLUTELY BORING, HARD TO SEE, and STUPID. WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie.
__label__1	Don't Waste Your Time: I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time.
__label__1	"It COULD have been a great movie . . ..: Okay. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere was suitably claustrophobic. The background music fit the feel of the movie. The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the ""heroine"". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . .."
__label__2	A great follow up to Dog Soldiers: The Descent has everything you could want in a horror film. The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien. While I enjoyed Dog Soldiers quite a bit, The Descent is a film worthy of my horror DVD collection.
__label__2	Dark and Claustrophobic Horror: The Descent is a horror movie that develops a plot that's original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. I had never seen these actresses, who here play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version).
__label__2	Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!: Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book.
__label__2	Very Entertaining Movie: I watched the China Doll movie DVD that I received from Amazon.com and thought it was very entertaining movie. The movie builds up the relationship between Capt. Brandon (Victor Mature) and Shu Jin (Li Li Hua) which leads to their marriage and having a little baby. It is sad at the end as both Shu Jin and Capt. Brandon are both killed, but it was nice to see the daughter 14 years later being met at Los Angeles Airport by Capt. Brandon's old crew. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies that end up being very heartwarming.
__label__2	Wonderful Movie: I have not seen this movie since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon, I bought it straight away. On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy.
__label__2	About China Doll: This is a movie that i've wanted for over 20 yrs. Amazon.com is my hero!!!! This movie made me cry when i watched it after i had seen it with my dad, who died in 1990. This is a movie that makes me feel closer to him.
__label__1	Too Old: I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling.
__label__1	Terrible! Beyound-use date: Lipstick that arrived is so old, it even smells worse then my granny's oldest lipstick which she takes out from the tube with a match!I had to throw it away....
__label__2	Borror and Delong's Study of Insects: Great price...well over half off of the university's bookstore. Only black and white pictures and illustrations, but very thorough coverage of entomology.
__label__2	REVIEW - Borror & DeLong: This is a keystone book that should be in every entomologist's library next to Chapman's The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano's The Science of Entomology.
__label__2	Book purchase: Product was in excellent shape as indicated.I received the book quickly and would definitely do business with these people again.thanks
__label__1	Only a music producer can like this.: Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation.
__label__1	beware: The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant.
__label__1	happy i only wasted money for 2 Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound: Music Experience in 3-Dimensional SoundThis cd shouldnt have been recordedMy fault i bougt this cdWas tempted of the dts recordingI could have readed other rewiewsThe experience listen to this is saddnes over own stupidityLoke1858
__label__1	oh my goodness!: If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor.
__label__2	"The dummy ""FATS"" is hysterical!!!!: ALL I can really say about the movie is that the puppet steals the show. It really didn't matter how weak the story was because the puppet's comments made the show."
__label__1	"Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
__label__1	"More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony: Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
__label__2	"Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Movie!: forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as ""Fats"", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor."
__label__2	MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!: Though the movie was frightening enough, it wasn't what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. What I witnessed was the thing that STILL freaks me out when I think about it. The Magic commercial. All it was was Fats the dummy reciting a demonic poem. I can still say the poem to this day. I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again.
__label__2	Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated: FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since. Still, it has left a lasting , unavoidable impression upon me. I have both dreaded and longed to see it again. Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible.
__label__2	"Magic: If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. It is a bit ""off"" but it keeps you watching. A very different movie. Saw this years ago and remembered it. It never comes on cable. I think it is worth a look."
__label__2	Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film.: I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing.
__label__2	"A ventriloquists nightmare: Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist ""Corky"" and his dummy ""fats"" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in ""Magic"". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now."
__label__1	great movie massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon.
__label__2	"Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers: ""Magic"" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with ""The Bunker"" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles."
__label__1	"The Only Dummy Is The Writer: ""Magic"" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book."
__label__2	"He's NO Dummy. . .: Viewing ""Magic"" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to ""watch this actor."" I saw ""Magic"" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a ""squeeze box"" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role."
__label__2	Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing.
__label__2	"A truly great horror movie: I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."
__label__2	Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it.
__label__2	classic: i got this for my dad. it is super creepy and worth a watch, but don't watch it in the dark.
__label__2	Psychological thriller!: This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
__label__2	A little more money than what I expected to spend on in.: This is a good movie. My husband enjoyed it. I wasn't too impressed with the price of the movie since it was an older film.
__label__1	"The Silence of the Dummies: This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! ""Fats"" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see ""Fats"", but during some of the more ""romantic "" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real ""vent"" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit ""outside"" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano"
__label__1	Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
__label__1	Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters.
__label__2	"A revelation of life in small town America in early 1900s: Though a scholarly biography, the book reveals much more about life in a small mid-west America town at the turn of the century than many other biographies or novels. Well worth reading for an insight into ""news"" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon."
__label__2	Great biography of a very interesting journalist: This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating read. The role of the small-town newspaper publisher carried much of the moral weight of towns like Lamar, Missouri, during the first half of the twentieth century before the era of instant news carried by radio and television changed everything. The author does a fine job of demonstrating the role in both politics and society that newspaper publishers played during this era. Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri. In addition, he was a character that continues to shape the nature of the small town where he published; his legacy newspaper still is in publication.
__label__1	Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century.

__label__2	Beautiful Pen and Fast Delivery.: The pen was shipped promptly. This is the classic Montblanc pen that everyone raves about. It is Black in color with Golden Trim. It holds it's own and I am thankful to my parents to gift this to me as a Graduation Present. Someday I plan on buying more of these pens from Amazon.The vendors at Amazon are amazing. I have been a long time shopper at Amazon, mostly pens and electronics. However this pen was gifted to me by my mom and she has nothing but good things to say. I on my part love this pen.
